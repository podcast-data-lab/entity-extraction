Since then, Rubiales has been suspended but ignored calls to step down as Spanish football descends into chaos... even leading to his own mother going on hunger strike over accusations against him earlier this week.\nTo discuss a fast moving story and what it says for women in sport, The Athletic's Laura Williamson, Laia Cervello and Adam Crafton joined host Ayo Akinwolere.\n\nProduced by Adonis Pratsides\nAdditional Production by: Abi Paterson, Guy Clarke, Mike Stavrou and Jay Beale\n\n***\n\u2022\u00a0Grab your EXCLUSIVE NordVPN Deal by going to https://nordvpn.com/theathletic to get a Huge Discount off your NordVPN Plan + 4 months for free!

Was Dele failed by a succession of coaches, is he a player born in the wrong era tactically, or even a victim of the gaps in his own footballing education such was the speed of his rise to the top?\nPlus, did anyone think the Everton loan would work out and do we need to challenge the narrative of what success actually looks like for Alli?\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Browder\u00a0has been leading a campaign to expose allegations of corruption and human rights abuses that will lead to visa sanctions and asset freezes on those involved. Browder also explains\u00a0exactly why oligarchs like Roman Abraomovich are being sanctioned and how it may harm President Putin.\nLater in the pod we\u2019ll be joined by MP\u00a0Clive Efford who was part of a committee that yesterday questioned leading figures about\u00a0the role of Russian money in football and if the Government is concerned about investments in UK sport from other nations with poor human rights records.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

With Mikel Arteta approaching two years in the job we look at the reasons why his team feels further away than ever from being where they need to be, the issues the club have had with recruitment and the structure above Arteta that may also be responsible for the problems.\nWe're also joined by The Athletic's Chelsea writer Liam Twomey to reflect on an impressive outing from Romelu Lukaku on his return to the club and look ahead to a greater challenge in Liverpool at Anfield next weekend.\nAll this plus news of Eddie Nketiah potentially leaving Arsenal this week, Kurt Zouma's impending move to West Ham, and an update on the latest with the Harry Kane situation.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
