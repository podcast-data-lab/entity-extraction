If you\u2019ve danced to Europop that fronts like hip-hop, you\u2019re living in a world Milli Vanilli helped create.\n\u00a0\nChris Molanphy continues to break down the history of Milli Vanilli mastermind Frank Farian\u2019s musical career: from his burst of Billboard chart success, to the storied past of the Best New Artist Grammy award. From MTV News to Behind the Music, the Milli Vanilli story has been told and retold. But the Billboard chart feats achieved by Rob and Fab, and their accomplices, reveal just how addicted America was to their music\u2014and maybe, how they won that Grammy.\n\nHit Parade episodes are now split into two parts, released two weeks apart.

Lady Gaga?\n\u00a0\nIn all cases, the answer isn\u2019t obvious\u2014it\u2019s not the album you know best, the one with the most hits on it. It\u2019s the album after that classic that goes to No. 1. And there\u2019s no better example than AC/DC, the Australian-by-way-of-Scotland hard rock band that\u2019s sold more than 20 million copies of Back in Black. But it was their next album (can you name it?) that topped the Billboard album chart.\n\u00a0\nChris Molanphy has coined a term for this weird chart phenomenon: He calls it The AC/DC Rule. Just as less-good movie sequels open better at the box office than classic first installments, follow-up albums often chart higher than their slow-growing but hit-packed predecessors. Some of the rock and pop legends who fell prey to this chart phenomenon might surprise you\u2026might just leave you shook all night long.\n\u00a0\nPodcast production by Asha Saluja.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

If you are a Plus member, you\u2019ll hear the whole show all at once, the day it drops. If you are not a Plus member, you will receive the first half of the episode mid-month, with ads, and you\u2019ll have to wait a couple of weeks to hear the second half of the show, at month\u2019s end.

Ryznar, \u201cHollywood\u201d Steve Huey, and Dave Lyons, creators of the web series Yacht Rock and follow-up podcast Beyond Yacht Rock. Not only did they invent the very term that inspired the latest episode of Hit Parade, they have kept the fire alive by refining what the genre means.\n\nThe Yacht Rockers and Chris discuss the enduring legacy of the term they created\u2014from why the name stuck, to how it was perceived by the various artists whose music it defined. (Boz Scaggs is reportedly not happy.) They also reveal songs they\u2019d re-rate against their signature Yachtski scale, songs commonly tagged Yacht that are actually \u201cNyacht,\u201d and how they curate the boundaries of the genre. They even offer a Hit Parade\u2013exclusive announcement about what\u2019s next for their smooth creation.\n\nFinally, Chris quizzes a Slate Plus listener with some music trivia, gives her a chance to turn the tables on him, and previews next month\u2019s full-length episode.\n\nPodcast production by Asha Saluja.\u00a0\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

            "contentSnippet": "First, we have a few announcements about the future of Hit Parade\u2014and it\u2019s good news for both Slate Plus members and non-Plus listeners. While the economic challenges of COVID-19 certainly haven\u2019t abated, Hit Parade has attracted enough new Plus members to allow us to take some episodes out from behind Slate\u2019s paywall starting in September.\n\nStarting next month, full-length Hit Parade episodes will debut in the middle of the month, not the end (our next full-length episode drops on Friday, September 18). If you are a Plus member, you\u2019ll hear the whole show all at once, the day it drops. If you are not a Plus member, you will receive the first half of the episode mid-month, with ads, and you\u2019ll have to wait a couple of weeks to hear the second half of the show, at month\u2019s end. Finally, Hit Parade\u2014\u201cThe Bridge\u201d episodes will remain Plus-only.\n\nIAgain, thanks to many of you who signed up for Slate Plus just to hear Hit Parade, and of course the thousands of longtime Plus members. We plan to keep giving you the bonus content you expect. And a hearty welcome back to non-Plus listeners\u2014we hope you\u2019ll consider joining Slate Plus in the future, but you can also support Hit Parade by spreading the word about our episodes. And to sign up for Slate Plus to support the show, head over to\u00a0slate.com/hitparadeplus.\n\n\nIn this mini-episode of Hit Parade, host Chris Molanphy is joined by J.D. Ryznar, \u201cHollywood\u201d Steve Huey, and Dave Lyons, creators of the web series Yacht Rock and follow-up podcast Beyond Yacht Rock. Not only did they invent the very term that inspired the latest episode of Hit Parade, they have kept the fire alive by refining what the genre means.\n\nThe Yacht Rockers and Chris discuss the enduring legacy of the term they created\u2014from why the name stuck, to how it was perceived by the various artists whose music it defined. (Boz Scaggs is reportedly not happy.) They also reveal songs they\u2019d re-rate against their signature Yachtski scale, songs commonly tagged Yacht that are actually \u201cNyacht,\u201d and how they curate the boundaries of the genre. They even offer a Hit Parade\u2013exclusive announcement about what\u2019s next for their smooth creation.\n\nFinally, Chris quizzes a Slate Plus listener with some music trivia, gives her a chance to turn the tables on him, and previews next month\u2019s full-length episode.\n\nPodcast production by Asha Saluja.\u00a0\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

So we're asking you to sign up for Slate Plus, our membership program. It's just $35 for the first year, and it goes a long way to supporting us in this crucial moment.\nFor decades\u2014literally since Woodstock\u2014female musicians had battled music-industry perceptions that amassing too many of them, on the radio or on the road, was bad for business. And yet, by the \u201990s, women were vital to the rise of alt-rock and hip-hop on the charts: from Suzanne Vega to Queen Latifah, Tracy Chapman to Sheryl Crow, Natalie Merchant to Missy Elliott.\nSarah McLachlan harnessed this energy into an all-woman tour she dubbed Lilith Fair. Its string of sellouts from 1997 to \u201999 affirmed women\u2019s clout in the decade of grunge-and-gangsta.

From the very birth of rock-and-roll, novelty songs were essential elements of the hit parade. Right through the \u201970s\u2014the age of streaking, CB radios, disco and King Tut\u2014novelty songs could be chart-topping hits. But by the corporate \u201980s, it was harder for goofballs to score round-the-clock hits on regimented radio playlists.\nUntil one perm-headed, mustachioed, accordion-playing parodist who called himself \u201cWeird\u201d rebooted novelty hits for the new millennium. A video jokester before YouTube, he just might have ushered in the age of the meme. So join Hit Parade this month as we walk through the history of novelty hits on the charts\u2014most especially if M.C. Escher is your favorite M.C.\nPodcast production by Justin D.
