    "description": "\n      <p>You never really know someone\u2026especially online. In today\u2019s world, the power of influence can be the quickest path to money and fame, and it often ends in ruin. These are the stories of the world\u2019s most insidious Scamfluencers. And we are their prey. On Wondery\u2019s new weekly series, join co-hosts Scaachi Koul and Sarah Hagi as they unpack epic stories of deception from the worlds of social media, fashion, finance, health, and wellness. These influencers claim to be everything from charismatic healers to trusted financial insiders to experts in dating. They cast spells over millions. Why do we believe them, and how does our culture allow them to thrive? From Black Swan Murder to a fake social media influencer to an audacious Hollywood Ponzi schemer, each season will take the listener along the twists and turns, the impact on victims, and what\u2019s left when the facade falls away.</p><p>New episodes come out every Monday for free, with 1-week early access for Wondery+ subscribers. Listen ad-free on Wondery+ or on Amazon Music with a Prime membership or Amazon Music Unlimited subscription.</p>\n    ",

Hans grows into a brash and intense player who makes questionable moves during online chess tournaments, but he doesn\u2019t want that to define him. When he finally gets the opportunity to compete against Magnus, the combined force of their egos and ambitions collide, threatening to tarnish both of their legacies.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info."
