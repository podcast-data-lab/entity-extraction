    "description": "On The ReadME Podcast, we take a look behind the scenes of the most impactful open source projects and the developers who make them happen. Our guests are coding in public, working on the periphery of open source, and taking time to consider how we think about technology. In sharing these stories, we hope to provide a spotlight on what you don\u2019t always see in the lines of code, and what it takes to build the technology that inspires us all.\n\nCheck-out The ReadME Project for more episodes, stories and features: https://github.com/readme",
