    "description": "\u201cWhat is the gospel?\u201d Responses continuously return to an inward-looking faith instead of a faith that clings externally to the astonishing mercy of Christ Jesus, who took the sin\r\nof the world into Himself on the cross and breathed out His life for and onto His creation. \u00a0In this act of\r\nsacrifice, Jesus is indeed the sacrificial Lamb who takes away the sin of the world. Through His resurrection,\r\nJesus Christ has given His promise of eternal life in Him.",

Through His resurrection,\r\nJesus Christ has given His promise of eternal life in Him."
