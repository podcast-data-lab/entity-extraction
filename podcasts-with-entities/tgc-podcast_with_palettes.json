This adoption into the family of God allows us to have a rich relationship with God as our Heavenly Father.\nThe Role of Forgiveness: Forgiveness is essential, especially in dealing with strained relationships with earthly fathers. Linne encourages her audience to pray for their parents if they should find themselves spiritually lost or emotionally broken, and to forgive with the understanding that forgiveness doesn't necessarily mean re-establishing unhealthy relationships.\nWriting Your Story and Praying for Parents: Linne suggests the therapeutic exercise of writing your story, including any emotions and thoughts related to your earthly father. She recommends the practice of writing letters to your earthly father or to God and advises praying for your parents, especially if they are still alive.\nPrioritizing Your Redeemed Family (The Church): Linne emphasizes the importance of prioritizing your church family, as they are part of your redeemed family and are essential in the healing journey.

Jesus also prays for the safekeeping of his disciples, knowing they'll sin and fail. In this way, we must also pray for protection and safekeeping from the temptation to sin and drift from God.</p><p>Jesus\u2019s prayer illustrates the story of a God who gives good gifts. DeYoung says, \u201cThis is a prayer, start to finish, replete with God, the Trinitarian Giver of gifts. The Father gifts the Son, to give the disciples and the church eternal life and the words of life, that they might participate as a gift in this life of glory.\u201d</p>\n",

He gives five truths about sanctification that help anchor the soul:\u00a0</p><p>1. Justification and sanctification both ground our sense of freedom in the Christian life, providing a way to obey.</p><p>2. God\u2019s grace always produces heart change in the believer, which leads to seeing God\u2019s delight in us.</p><p>3. Worldliness doesn\u2019t subject itself to the law of God, and when we pursue worldliness, the Spirit\u2019s work in us can feel like death.</p><p>4. Worldliness is unable to subject itself to God\u2019s law. We are actually in bondage when we follow our own way, but when we submit, we are free.</p><p>5.

An already ambitious 3-year project became even more so when, only a few months after launch, the world was shaken by a global pandemic. But the sovereign timing of the project unexpectedly worked for good, creating a hymnal of hope and comfort for listeners in a world that seemed to be falling apart. In the interview, the duo addresses the origins of their project and what it takes for a married couple with young children to continually muster the creative energy to create for this ongoing work of art for the church.</p>\n",

It was through the care of a rugged fisherman with a thick Scottish accent, a glass eye, and a long beard that he was introduced to the Bible and the gospel broke into his stubborn, dead, and cold heart. Hope was stirred as Christ and his church became a refuge for his weary soul, and he worked to create the same for other victims when he became a pastor. Spandler-Davidson enumerated three ways churches can become a hope-giving refuge for victims of abuse and several ways to ensure that your church can be a place of safety for the vulnerable and healing for the hurting.</p>\n",

To listen to the full conversation, check out Gospelbound on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gospelbound/id1499898207?i=1000492903444\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/0kRYr5FTKr5ru1N7MR65Br?si=CNCrgmMCRCC6iA5OvAYcmQ\">Spotify</a>, and anywhere you listen to your podcasts.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Show Notes:\u00a0</strong></p><p>Elections have consequences, but not nearly as much as we probably think. That's what Collin Hansen concluded after reading David Platt's new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Before-You-Vote-Questions-Christian/dp/1734952237\"><i><strong>Before You Vote: Seven Questions Every Christian Should Ask</strong></i></a>, published by Radical.\u00a0</p><p>Here's a sober dose of biblical reality from Platt in the book:\u00a0</p><p>\"Even if we lose every freedom and protection we have as followers of Jesus in the United States, and even if our government were to become a completely totalitarian regime, we could still live in abundant life as long as we didn't look to political leaders, platforms or policies for our ultimate security and satisfaction.\"</p><p>It's not exactly the way you run fundraising and get out the vote operations in today's American politics, but Platt's book includes lots of counter-cultural advice, saturated with biblical references on humility, freedom, and duty, along with David's characteristic perspective informed by the global church. Platt serves as lead pastor of McLean Bible Church in Northern Virginia, a congregation where employment for many depends on the outcome of the November elections.
