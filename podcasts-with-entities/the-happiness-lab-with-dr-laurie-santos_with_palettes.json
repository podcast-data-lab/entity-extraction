But in our normal lives the sensations of rage we experience are false alarms - we aren't in real peril and we don't need to resort to extreme survival behaviors, such as violence.\r\n\r\nTherapist Faith Harper (author of Unfuck Your Anger) explains why our bodies evolved this anger response, and how we can ride out the initial wave of rage and reduce the negative effects of anger on us and our relationships. She also shows that anger has its place in pushing us to find constructive ways to challenge bad things in the world around us.\r\n\r\nWARNING: This episode contains some strong language.\r\n\r\nYou can find Faith's books at the link below.\r\n\r\nhttps://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/artist/faith-g-harper\r\n\r\n Learn more about your ad-choices at https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."
