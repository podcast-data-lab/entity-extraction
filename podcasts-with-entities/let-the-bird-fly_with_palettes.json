He covered Adam and Eve\u2019s shame and nakedness with garments of animal skin. He designed and instructed the Israelites on the priestly wardrobe of the Tabernacle. And now he clothes his children in the righteousness of Jesus, our King, who first came to us wrapped in swaddling clothes before he hung naked on the cross.

In this episode we prove it. In episode TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN, Jason and Wade talk to Pastor James Metsger of Christ Point in Charlotte, North Carolina, one of Wade's best friends since high school. This was our first attempt at hosting a remote guest with the new equipment, and Wade was thrilled and grateful that James was able to be that first guest. While they took different paths and serve in different denominations (Wade is Lutheran and James is not Lutheran, and lets Wade refer to him as a Baptist for purposes of the episode, and because he knows from decades of experience that Wade is going to say what he wants no matter what), they both found their way into ministry. After years of talking about recording something, they finally did, and talked about their experiences and lessons learned since their days together in their youth.

For this episode we have three big questions to address regarding hermeneutics. We hope to follow up more on the topic later as well, eventually delving into Matthias Flacius' rules for interpreting the Sacred Scriptures.

We really enjoyed this one and are hoping we can get Greg and Collin back on soon to keep the discussion going.

They've been doing this podcast for a long time now, and they figure they've earned the right to be a little blunt. Without letting Mike know beforehand, Wade chose the topic for the episode, knowing it would lead to vigorous discussion. Wade introduces a simple thesis: The Lord's Supper is the very body and blood of Christ, given for the forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation. If that thesis is true, what does that mean for Christian theology, the Christian life, the divine service, piety, etc.? Once Wade winds Mike up, they give the topic a good go. There's a lot more to discuss here, but this is what came to mind first. We hope you enjoy the conversation! If the guys get you worked up, too, maybe that's not a bad thing. It's an opportunity to step back and ask why that is. Maybe it's because the guys were feisty and talking nonsense, but maybe not...?\u00a0\r\n\r\nOh, John wanders in halfway through the episode, because he was the worship coordinator for the district convention held at the college. After a few minutes, it was pretty clear he realized the guys were worked up. Kudos him for handling things so pastorally at the end when Wade insisted he jump on a mic before things wrapped up.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n We are grateful to the 1517 podcasting network.

                "summary": "In the SIXTY-SIXTH session of our <a href=\"https://www.letthebirdfly.com/tag/life-of-luther/\">Wingin' It series on the Life of Luther</a>, Wade and Mike wrap things up. This series started in December of 2018. It has been quite the undertaking, but very beneficial for both of the guys as they've worked through everything. Even if you've not listened to the series so far, the finale is worth checking out, as they discuss why Luther matters, his place today, what his lasting contributions to the church have been, and the dangers of trying to \"play Luther,\" among other things We hope you enjoy the session and, if you haven't, maybe check out the series. There is one \"earmuffs\" moment, but Wade gives ample warning beforehand, so don't blame him if you hear a colorful word. If you need to blame someone, blame Jason for not being there to keep order.\u00a0<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet the Bird Fly! is supported by the <a style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"https://www.1517.org/podcasts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1517 Podcast Network</a>, which is part of <a href=\"http://www.1517.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1517.org</a>.

Waldschmidt does a nice job of explaining the basics of this view and how it doesn\u2019t match up with the traditional Reformation reading of St. Paul and his epistles. Rev. Waldschmidt is certainly qualified to speak on this topic having studied it during his Masters work at <a href=\"https://divinity.tiu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trinity International University\u2019s Divinity School</a> and having presented an essay on the topic at <a href=\"https://www.wls.wels.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wisconsin in Lutheran Seminary</a>. You can find a digital copy of that essay <a href=\"https://essays.wls.wels.net/handle/123456789/4443\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. <br />\r\nA big thanks to Rev.

The talk was given the day before Valentine's Day, but Mike assured the audience that that was mere coincidence (evidently he and Rev. Bortulin don't always remember the date of Valentines day...shocking, really).\r\n\r\nAlthough the title might suggest that Mike discussed C.S. Lewis's work The Four Loves, in reality he just stole the idea and did his own thing. If you are interested in a discussion of C.S. Lewis's work, though, we did cover that way back on Episode 45, so go check that one out. In this talk, Mike uses the structure that Lewis presents to discuss the way in which God's love for us (agape) animates all other love through us, even if imperfectly. \r\nA big thanks to St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church for inviting Mike to speak.

We are fortunate to have duped him into joining us again (probably because Mike has since joined the podcast and brought some level of respectability to it). Dr. Kuehn is a physicist, which is the topic we (sort of) discussed with him on his previous episode. In this episode, however, we discuss another area that he's spent time pursuing: Apologetics.

Before getting to the real topic, though, the trio discusses books that they know they should've read (and maybe even pretend like they have), but still haven't. <br />\r\nA big thanks to Dr. Parker Fedewa for putting up with the guys and joining us for this episode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're interested in joining Wade and Mike at the <a href=\"http://www.HereWeStillStand.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2019 Here We Still Stand </a>conference in San Diego, <a href=\"http://www.HereWeStillStand.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">head over there</a> now to see if there are still tickets available (but hurry, this will sell out).

Paul Horn, who is pastor at Lamb of God Lutheran Churuch in Lafayette, Indiana. Rev. Horn has also served congregations in Kentucky and Georgia and has had a number of opportunities to serve military families. We wanted to have him on to discuss the challenges and benefits of serving this unique group of people. Since Mike's in charge again, you'll be without a Free-for-All (eventually Wade will see what he's up to, though, and get back on an episode to right the ship). Rev. Horn forces Mike into a mini-Free-for-All, however, so not all is lost (thanks, Paul!).\r\n\r\nThanks to Rev.

In this episode Wade and Dr. Keith square off over two influential characters in the early Reformation: Philip Melanchton and Matthias Flacius Illyricus (these just so happen to be the dissertation topics of these distinguished doctors, so it's sure to be a good conversation).

They've mentioned Wallace on previous episodes and even dedicated an entire episode to his Consider the Lobster. Before diving into the main topic, the guys decided to commemorate their (official) 100th episode by asking the question Where would you most like to record an episode. Wade takes them to Detroit (because Wade), Mike doesn't know the capital of Albania, and Peter is a bit salty that they're not recording in West Allis (don't worry, though, they made it there right after recording). But the real reason they got together was to discuss the talk by David Foster Wallace, and that they do. If you'd like to listen to Wallace's This is Water, you can do so right here; and if you'd like to read it, you can find the text right here.\r\nWe would like to thank all of our listeners for joining the conversation over the past couple of years. It's amazing that we've made it to 100 (official) episodes and no one is more surprised by that than we are. It's been a fun ride. We hope you've been digging it as much as we have.

This has been a tremendous blessing for us, and we wouldn't be doing it without you and your support.\r\nSome books mentioned in the episode:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw and Gospel in Action: Foundation, Ethics, Church by Mark Mattes\r\nInfinite Jest by David Foster Wallace\r\nSeculosity by David Zahl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in joining Wade and Mike at the 2019 Here We Still Stand conference in San Diego, head over there now to see if there are still tickets available (but hurry, this will sell out). And if you do sign up, remember to use the promo code PNET19 to save $25 off your registration.\r\nIf you'd like more information on the Apologetics course Mike is offering at Wisconsin Lutheran College during the summer of 2019, you can find all that information right here.

Wade hijacks the podcast and forces Mike and Peter to discuss the commodification of people. You might be surprised to find out that despite Wade's attempt to spring a topic on the guys, they managed to still find plenty to talk about. But first they decided to talk more baseball (can you tell they're all excited about their teams this season?) with a far-too-early review of the MLB season so far.\r\nSome books mentioned in the episode:\r\n\r\n \t\r\n\r\n \t\r\n\r\n \tInfinite Jest by David Foster Wallace\r\n \tBioethics: A Primer for Christians by Gilbert Meilaender\r\n \tSeculosity by David Zahl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the episode Wade mentioned the 2019 Here We Still Stand conference, which is hosted by 1517.org.
