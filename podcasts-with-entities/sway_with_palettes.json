Olga Tokariuk is a Ukrainian journalist and nonresident fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis who has covered Putin\u2019s escalating disinformation campaign. She shares an update from western Ukraine, as well as her observations about the lies Putin has used since 2014 to justify Russian invasion. \u201cThis war has been very dangerous for journalists,\u201d she tells Kara. And Tikhon Dzyadko is the editor in chief of T.V. Rain, the last independent television station in Russia before it suspended operations there in early March. Dzyadko, now based in Georgia, recently fled Russia for safety reasons. \u201cI feel humiliated because I\u2019m not a criminal. I did nothing wrong to be forced to leave the country,\u201d he says.

In observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we\u2019re re-airing Kara\u2019s interview with Wilkerson.\u00a0</p><p>This conversation was taped last year, shortly after the events of Jan. 6.

Parler effectively went offline because of these three moves, and Matze lost his job.\n\nA year after Jan. 6, and with Parler back online, Swisher interviews the platform\u2019s new chief executive, George Farmer. He\u2019s bent on reviving Parler, saying: \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen a company quite so unceremoniously booted off into digital exile. It\u2019s the kind of medieval equivalent of the church sort of excommunicating someone.\u201d He sees the deplatforming of Parler and the former president as signs that Big Tech has gotten too big and too powerful, calling the companies \u201cthe unprecedented leviathans of the corporate world.\u201d And yet, Farmer notes, \u201chere we are basically saying, \u2018These guys are good guys.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn this conversation, Swisher pushes Farmer on how his platform failed on Jan. 6 and what it may still be missing today. They also discuss Donald Trump\u2019s return to social media and the end of Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s personal Twitter account. And while they both agree that Apple, Amazon and Google could have done more to punish other social media sites, like Facebook and Twitter, after Jan. 6, Swisher pushes back on Farmer\u2019s assertion that the lack of action was some kind of \u201ccolluding behavior\u201d among tech giants. Her take? They simply didn\u2019t want \u201cthe stink of sedition\u201d that Parler and Matze helped enable a year ago.\n\nThis episode contains strong language.\n\nYou can find transcripts (posted midday) and more information for all episodes at nytimes.com/sway, and you can find Kara on Twitter @karaswisher."

Representative Adam Schiff and the rest of the Jan. 6 House select committee are issuing subpoenas to key witnesses, including Steve Bannon, Dan Scavino and two \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally organizers. \u201cNo one is off the table,\u201d Schiff says.</p><p>But in a political ecosystem that is defined in part by the spread of misinformation and polarization on platforms like Facebook and the power of right-wing media outlets like Fox News and One America News Network, how much will a congressional investigation actually move the needle on a democracy at risk? Especially when the effort \u2014 billed as bipartisan \u2014 has only two Republican members?</p><p>In this conversation, Kara presses Schiff on the Jan. 6 committee\u2019s ability to bring about change and its efforts to subpoena key witnesses.

The co-founder and chief executive of 23andMe has led the genetic testing company through 14 years in which it has collected data from millions of customers through their at-home DNA spit test kits. In 2018, the company announced a collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline to use this anonymized, aggregated data to develop new pharmaceutical drugs \u2014\u00a0and attracted a $300 million investment from the pharmaceutical giant. And in June, when Wojcicki took the company public, it was valued at $3.5 billion. In some ways, it\u2019s a standard Silicon Valley play: Lure customers in with the promise of democratizing information before quickly moving to monetize that information. But what are the implications when the information at stake is your DNA?\n\nIn this conversation, Kara Swisher presses Wojcicki on the ethical, privacy and security questions intertwined with the 23andMe business model. They discuss what the rise of genetic testing might mean for today\u2019s 2-year-olds and how the United States is faring in a \u201cgenetic information race\u201d with China. And they dig into the ongoing Theranos trial \u2014 specifically, whether the case against Elizabeth Holmes will rein in a Silicon Valley health tech sector that, in the past, has run a little wild.\n\nYou can find transcripts (posted midday) and more information for all episodes at nytimes.com/sway, and you can find Kara on Twitter @karaswisher.",

And most recently, she drew criticism from her own members when she personally endorsed a vaccine mandate and promised to work with states and school boards that are seeking to enact vaccine mandates or vaccinate-or-test requirements for teachers.\n\nIn this conversation, Kara Swisher presses Weingarten on reopening procedures and the spectacle around mask mandates in states like Florida and Texas. They also discuss the wave of legislation prohibiting teachers from discussing critical race theory in classrooms, and why this former teacher has become a lightning rod for the right.\n\nYou can find transcripts (posted midday) and more information for all episodes at nytimes.com/sway, and you can find Kara on Twitter @karaswisher."

His argument is this: Since the 1970s, computers have gotten exponentially better even as they\u2019re gotten cheaper, a phenomenon known as Moore\u2019s Law. Altman believes that A.I. could get us closer to Moore\u2019s Law for everything: it could make everything better even as it makes it cheaper.

Some of it is speculative, of course, but some of it isn\u2019t. That shift of power and wealth is already underway. Altman is proposing an answer: a move toward taxing land and wealth, and distributing it to all.

Or will they fight it tooth-and-nail?</p><p>We also discuss who is funding the A.I. revolution, the business models these systems will use (and the dangers of those business models), how A.I. would change the geopolitical balance of power, whether we should allow trillionaires, why the political debate over A.I. is stuck, why a pro-technology progressivism would also need to be committed to a radical politics of equality, what global governance of A.I. could look like, whether I\u2019m just \u201cenergy flowing through a neural network,\u201d and much more.</p><p>You can find more information for all episodes at <a href=\"http://nytimes.com/sway\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>nytimes.com/sway</strong></a>, and you can find Kara on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karaswisher\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>@karaswisher</strong></a>.</p>\n",
