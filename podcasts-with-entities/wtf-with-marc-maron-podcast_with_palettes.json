Rhea and Marc compare notes on why they both feel insecure and inadequate despite their natural talents, such as Rhea's skills at painting, sculpting and building. They also talk about her father's secretive life in the Naval Intelligence Services, the perils of pilot season, and why Bob Odenkirk is so hard on himself. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material! <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Finally, after more than 10 years, Marc talks with the most well-known, most successful, and arguably most influential comedian in history, Jerry Seinfeld. About comedy. About how Jerry got started in comedy, how he was incapable of socializing, how he forged a friendship with Larry David, how he fueled himself with anger toward one person in particular. But mostly just about comedy and what comedy is. They have some, it\u2019s fair to say, differing opinions on it.\u00a0This episode is sponsored by Pataday Once-Daily Relief and <a href=\"http://stamps.com/\">Stamps.com</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material! <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

She was a pot dealer, she had a hidden cocaine habit, and she was deeply in the closet. Jessica worked to unburden herself of all those secrets and found a breakthrough when her grandmother told her, at 29 years old, that she should be a comedian. Jessica and Marc talk about her therapist mom, her stepbrother Zach Braff, her ex-girlfriend Susan Powter, and her unexpected friend Robert DeNiro. She also explains what it\u2019s like to finally allow herself to experience success.\u00a0This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squarespace</a> and <a href=\"http://stance.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stance Socks</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material! <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

She\u2019s known as THE rock groupie, but further distinguished herself as a writer, educator, tour guide and interviewer, all involving her life on the road throughout modern music history. Growing up in California with a love of Jesus and Elvis, it wasn\u2019t surprising she was drawn to the charismatic allure of rock stars. Pamela tells Marc about her time with Frank Zappa, Phil Spector, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Keith Moon, Mick Jagger, Tiny Tim, Jim Morrison, Waylon Jennings, and more, as she experienced the highs of the Free Love 60s as well as the era\u2019s dismal end at Altamont.\u00a0This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://zoro.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zoro.com</a> and <a href=\"http://newmexico.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New Mexico Tourism & Travel</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material! <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

June and Marc talk about all of that, as well as her improv background, her marriage to How Did This Get Made? co-host Paul Scheer, and what she learns from working with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin.\u00a0This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squarespace</a>, <a href=\"http://sweetango.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SweeTango Apples</a>, and <a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BetterHelp</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material! <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

It all culminated with Alex\u2019s most recent film, Her Smell, which he made with his frequent collaborator Elisabeth Moss.\u00a0This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://anchor.fm/start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anchor</a> (<a href=\"http://anchor.fm/start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anchor.fm/start</a>), <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squarespace</a> (<a href=\"http://squarespace.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">squarespace.com/wtf</a>), and <a href=\"http://zinus.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zinus</a> (<a href=\"http://zinus.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">zinus.com/WTF</a>). <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material! <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

That disconnect has helped her in her work and life, like when she performs with her husband,\u00a0Peter Sarsgaard, or when she turns to her mother for screenwriting advice. Maggie and Marc also talk about\u00a0the sexual politics of The Deuce and how they match up with the Hollywood today,\u00a0her relationship to poetry and how that factored into her performance in The Kindergarten Teacher,\u00a0what she learned about herself making Secretary, and what kind of\u00a0support system she shares with her brother Jake.\u00a0This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://omahasteaks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Omaha Steaks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Music</a>, <a href=\"http://23andme.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">23andMe</a>, and <a href=\"http://nytimes.com/timescrossword\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the New York Times Crossword Puzzle App</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material! <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
