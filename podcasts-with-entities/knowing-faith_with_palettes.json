His revelation of Himself and His ways so that we might be rescued from sin and we may worship God in ways that please Him.\nCreeds and Confessions: Statements of faith that express what the church believes and is to believe based on the entirety of scripture.\nWritings of Leaders from Church History: Treasures of wisdom from the past. Help us to know what we are to do in terms of rightly interpreting the bible, how to put the Bible together in terms of affirming and defending sound doctrine, and how to correctly live out biblical instructions so as to fully please God in life and ministry.\n\nGuest Bios:\nDr. Gregg Allison is Professor of Christian Theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and the author of many books: He is the author of Historical Theology: An Introduction to Christian Doctrine; Sojourners and Strangers: The Doctrine of the Church; Roman Catholic Theology and Practice: An Evangelical Assessment; The Holy Spirit (Theology for the People of God); Embodied: Living as Whole People in a Fractured World; 50 Core Truths of the Christian Faith.\nJackie Hill Perry is an author, poet, bible teacher and hip-hop artist.

To learn more and become a patron visit <a href=\"http://patreon.com/trainingthechurch\">patreon.com/trainingthechurch</a>.</p><p><strong>Questions Covered in This Episode:</strong></p><ul><li>If we understand that Jesus, in His spiritual body, sits at the right hand of the Father after His ascension. How do we resolve the tension this presents to God's unchanging nature if before His ascension it was not Jesus in His spiritual body, particularly, but the Son of God that was at the Father's right hand?</li><li>When reading the Psalms there often references to statutes, ordinances, laws, testimonies, commandments, and precepts given by God. Is there a significant difference in the meaning of these different words?</li><li>I would love to hear each of you discuss the relationship between small groups and learning environments in your respective churches. How can these two spaces best complement one another without feeling competitive?</li><li>What does a typical week look like for everyone (work, church, family, fun, rest time)?</li><li>Would love your thoughts on good questions to explore with a teen in my home as we discuss this: Adam's sin resulted in all humanity being born with a sin nature and without Christ we 'can't not sin'. He believes it would've been more just for God to give each individual person a 'fruit on the tree' moment before they automatically 'receive' a sinful nature. In his view, we talk about someone who isn't a Christian choosing to sin, and yet at the same time, we believe that their nature is that they can't actually choose something different. This seems so contradictory to him. If God really wanted to give us a choice, why did he set us up to not be able to choose him first? Not us as in all humanity, but us as individuals. He doesn't think that 'we're human so we'd always fail' makes sense, because the reason that is true is because of the sin nature...so if it wasn't for that, we wouldn't necessarily fail.</li><li>On the doctrine of simplicity: Is god wrath? I've heard God is love but has wrath. But is wrathful an attribute of God? If wrath is an attribute, then, in the new heavens and new earth, after judgement day, what is that wrath directed towards?</li><li>\"How did women in the OT share in the sign of the covenant?\" How can something as important as the sign of the covenant between God's people could be reserved to something only men could do (aka. circumcision) and what if baptism as the sign of the new covenant was restricted to only men. Were women being left out of an essential part of what it meant to be in a relationship with God and his covenant people. Do y'all have any thoughts on this that might help resolve that tension?</li><li>Often, we hear about heated conversations related to women as pastors but we never hear such discussions about single male pastors. But, of course Paul writes about singleness as something he recommends to the church. Was that only intended for his specific context? Or is it biblically unfaithful to exclusively have married men with families in pastoral or deacon roles?</li><li>I have been focusing on Luke, and was freshly moved by the references to Mary treasuring up different revelations/experiences with Jesus (the shepherds visit after the angel of the Lord appearing to them and Jesus calling the temple his Father's house). Would it be appropriate to consider Luke as connecting Mary's experience with Psalm 119:11?</li><li>Why is Ephesians off limits?</li><li>Jen referred to Psalm 139 as the \u201clady Psalm,\u201d - I\u2019m wondering why she called it that?</li><li>What are your takes on celebrating Christmas by incorporating Santa Claus and on celebrating Halloween. How do you go about making those decisions and giving grace to those who differ?</li><li>If you could wave a magic wand, how would you organize a local church? What are the first three ministries you would focus on establishing in addition to the Sunday gathering?</li><li>Kyle you have recommended several sci-fi or fantasy books or authors through the seasons. So far I have really enjoyed all of your recommendations could you make some more?</li><li>The 6th command is \u201cDo not Murder.\u201d Why were the Israelites multiple times commanded to kill whole nations women and children?</li><li>What obscure or lesser known and taught passages of the Bible are some of your favorites and deserve more notice?</li><li>What about prophets/prophecy today? Is prophet a current office? What is a prophet today, or what is prophecy today? Can just anyone prophecy? Does any of it exist now?</li><li>Considering recently the implications of The Father as the one who sends, I'm seeing James 1:17 in a new light. The Father is the one who sent Jesus, sends the Spirit, ... and is the direct sender of blessings? Is that what I should be taking away here? So a quick, heartfelt \"Thank you, Jesus!\" upon receipt of rain, provision, etc, may not be the best expression of gratitude, when it should be \"Thank you, Father!\"? Are we robbing God the Father of the worship due Him when we attribute His goodness to Christ?

How do we resolve the tension this presents to God's unchanging nature if before His ascension it was not Jesus in His spiritual body, particularly, but the Son of God that was at the Father's right hand?</li><li>When reading the Psalms there often references to statutes, ordinances, laws, testimonies, commandments, and precepts given by God. Is there a significant difference in the meaning of these different words?</li><li>I would love to hear each of you discuss the relationship between small groups and learning environments in your respective churches. How can these two spaces best complement one another without feeling competitive?</li><li>What does a typical week look like for everyone (work, church, family, fun, rest time)?</li><li>Would love your thoughts on good questions to explore with a teen in my home as we discuss this: Adam's sin resulted in all humanity being born with a sin nature and without Christ we 'can't not sin'. He believes it would've been more just for God to give each individual person a 'fruit on the tree' moment before they automatically 'receive' a sinful nature. In his view, we talk about someone who isn't a Christian choosing to sin, and yet at the same time, we believe that their nature is that they can't actually choose something different. This seems so contradictory to him. If God really wanted to give us a choice, why did he set us up to not be able to choose him first? Not us as in all humanity, but us as individuals. He doesn't think that 'we're human so we'd always fail' makes sense, because the reason that is true is because of the sin nature...so if it wasn't for that, we wouldn't necessarily fail.</li><li>On the doctrine of simplicity: Is god wrath? I've heard God is love but has wrath. But is wrathful an attribute of God? If wrath is an attribute, then, in the new heavens and new earth, after judgement day, what is that wrath directed towards?</li><li>\"How did women in the OT share in the sign of the covenant?\" How can something as important as the sign of the covenant between God's people could be reserved to something only men could do (aka. circumcision) and what if baptism as the sign of the new covenant was restricted to only men. Were women being left out of an essential part of what it meant to be in a relationship with God and his covenant people. Do y'all have any thoughts on this that might help resolve that tension?</li><li>Often, we hear about heated conversations related to women as pastors but we never hear such discussions about single male pastors. But, of course Paul writes about singleness as something he recommends to the church. Was that only intended for his specific context? Or is it biblically unfaithful to exclusively have married men with families in pastoral or deacon roles?</li><li>I have been focusing on Luke, and was freshly moved by the references to Mary treasuring up different revelations/experiences with Jesus (the shepherds visit after the angel of the Lord appearing to them and Jesus calling the temple his Father's house). Would it be appropriate to consider Luke as connecting Mary's experience with Psalm 119:11?</li><li>Why is Ephesians off limits?</li><li>Jen referred to Psalm 139 as the \u201clady Psalm,\u201d - I\u2019m wondering why she called it that?</li><li>What are your takes on celebrating Christmas by incorporating Santa Claus and on celebrating Halloween.

Gnostics taught that after death, humans left their earthly bodies behind and enjoyed an immortal, spiritual presence with God.\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\nActs 17:24-28, Psalm 139:6, 17-18, Psalm 90:2, 1 Corinthians 2:10, John 17:3\n\nAmazon affiliate links are used where appropriate.

To learn more and become a patron visit patreon.com/trainingthechurch.\nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\nWe\u2019ve heard (and subsequently forgotten) the title of JT\u2019s dissertation. Jen and Kyle, if you had to write a dissertation, what would it be on?\nMy new pastor has grown a lot from his UPC roots, but isn\u2019t quite where I\u2019m at in regards to the trinity. I appreciate that He is looking to the Word and growing, but this is still my biggest concern. He says if NT Wright is a trinitarian, then so is he. I don\u2019t have context to interpret that well. He\u2019s also leery of the word \u201cpersons\u201d when speaking of the trinity, but does affirm distinction and oneness. He agrees that Father is not Son, etc, but all three are one God. Can you speak a bit about what I am losing if I agree to disagree here? Is there a major loss in saying \u2018three beings, one God\u2019 instead?\nOur pastor views keeping a Sabbath as wise and beneficial, but doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessarily a command we have to keep. Is this true?\nFor Kyle, would you be willing to talk about your relationship with foster care? I\u2019d love to hear about your theology surrounding foster care, and how your faith informs how you\u2019ve participated in caring for foster children and/or their families.\nWhat habits have you guys found to be the most beneficial for your spiritual life and family life?\nHow do you, in your personal lives find the balance between Christian liberty and holiness, particularly as it pertains to your Christian witness?\nWhat is Phoebe\u2019s role in the delivery of Romans?\nWhen you were in elementary school, what would we have found you usually doing during recess....tetherball? Trading baseball cards? Bullying kids for their lunch money?\nWere Adam and Eve indwelt by the Spirit? Did they lose him? And is the Holy Spirit\u2019s indwelling of believers now a restoring of what was broken in the garden?\nCan you speak pastorally and practically about transitioning out of ministry in a small church that\u2019s not in the best of health? Have any of you had any experience with graciously handing over your sheep in a church you have deep concerns about?\nCan y\u2019all talk about alcohol?... And cannabis too. Let\u2019s assume for discussion purposes that it\u2019s legal for both medical and recreational use, at the state and federal levels. Should it be lumped in with how we view alcohol use?\nAll of you seem to like reading and read a lot. Is it innate or an acquired skill? Do you have tips to be a better reader? How can I not dislike reading so much?\nHow do you have gospel-centered conversations with close people in your life who are not believers?\nManuscript or outline when giving a message?\n@Kyle Worley, I believe you\u2019ve said plant and animal death is amoral (i.e., plant and animal death could occur before the fall because their life and death doesn\u2019t go against God\u2019s created order and will as human death does). Recently, a family member got upset by my choice to eliminate mice from my home via execution instead of relocation. This brought about the discussion of whether plants and animals have souls. I\u2019m curious to hear y\u2019all\u2019s evidence on morality surrounding plants and animals.\nJen, if you could talk to your 30 year old self, what advice would you give her specifically related to teaching the Bible?\nWhat do we mean when we say we\u2019re evangelical? Meaning-evangelical as opposed to what?\n\nHelpful Definitions:\u00a0\n\nEvangelical: From the Greek term euangelion.\nBebbington's Quadrilateral:\nBelief in the Bible. This is God\u2019s word, it\u2019s authoritative for our life, it\u2019s the story of the world, and we submit ourselves to it.\nThe cross. The most definitive event in human history, this is where we find our redemption, our reconciliation to God, atonement, justification.\nThe concept of being born again. The cross and the giving of the Holy Spirit is something that needs to happen. The cross isn\u2019t s concept that is meaningful for you until you have realized I am a sinner in need of redemption, reconciliation, and ultimately regeneration.\nActivism. We want to be engaged in our world in biblically meaningful ways to extend God\u2019s cultural mandate or the great commission to the ends of the earth.\n\n\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\nThe Family Discipleship Podcast\n\u201cTen Words to Live By\u201d by Jen Wilkin\n\u201cCannabis and the Christian\u201d by Todd Miles\n\u201cFood Trucks in Babylon\u201d Podcast\n\u201cConfessions\u201d by Augustine\n\u201cA Non-Anxious Presence\u201d by Mark Sayers\n\nAmazon affiliate links are used where appropriate.

Idolatry: We are born into this world not giving our worship, affection, and loyalty to God. Immorality: We don\u2019t behave as we ought. We are unable and unwilling to choose righteousness.\nRighteousness:\nFrom God: Righteous standing that God gives. The source of salvation. What we need to be made in order to be saved.\nOf God: The perfect character of God that we are to imitate. God\u2019s standard.His expectations of His people.\nHis faithfulness to his covenant promises: The character of God.\n\nJustification:\nIs to be declared righteous by the righteous God.\nForgiven for good, forever.\nWhen we are justified by the blood of Christ, we are saved from sin\u2019s penalty.\n\nFaith:\nThe instrument of our salvation, we draw everything from the work of Christ and contribute nothing to it.\nThe ascent of our minds to that which God says is true. Adoration, God deserves my worship, love, and affection. Giving my actions over to Him, a life of obedience, allegiance, and loyalty.\n\nSanctification: Freed day by day to look more and more like Jesus.\nAs we are being sanctified, we are being saved from sin\u2019s power.\n\nGrace: You have been given freedom so that you can live in God\u2019s way.\nIn Adam/In Christ: Federal Headship: You are either being represented by being in Adam or by being in Christ.\nFlesh/Spirit: We are born in the flesh (our natural state apart from the intervening work of God in salvation), some are reborn in Christ and because of that are able to set their minds on things of the Spirit.\nAdoption: We have been invited to fellowship with God. The beloved Father who welcomes us to His table.\nCompatibilist: Hold in tension that God is sovereign and providential over everything and yet our wills are compatible and fully free within His sovereignty.\nPredestined: God elects a people for himself before the foundations of the world.\nCalled:\nGeneral Call of the Gospel: The gospel proclamation to everyone.\nEffectual Call: Those whom God predestined he calls through the preaching of the gospel into salvation. The spirit wrought activity of awakening the heart and bringing that person into Christ Jesus.\n\nGlorification:\nThere is a time that is coming in the future where we will be gifted a resurrected body and we will be glorified. Meaning we will be free from even the ability to sin. We will be transformers from one degree of glory to the next.

To learn more and become a patron visit <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/knowingfaith\">patreon.com/knowingfaith</a>.</p><p>Questions Covered in This Episode:</p><ul><li>\u201cDo you have recommendations for books/podcasts/resources/etc for doing something similar but age appropriate for older kids?\u201d</li><li>\u201cIs the language about God being Father & Son literal or figurative or both?\u201d</li><li>\u201cAre we ever at risk of reading too much into parallels, types, significant numbers etc. and drawing conclusions that weren\u2019t intended as we attempt to comprehend and interpret on our own?\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhy do you think that in the New Creation there will be no darkness (Rev. 21:22-25) yet in the first creation, before there was sin, God created darkness and light? 1 Jn 1:5 says there is no darkness in God, but why then did God create night in the first place?\u201d</li><li>\u201cRegarding Gen 3:24. What happened to the garden, the cherubim & flaming sword after Adam and Eve left? What happened to the tree of life or tree of knowledge of good & evil?\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhat is a theological belief or tradition that you used to hold too firmly but changed your mind (or at least you are no longer as confident in)?\u201d</li><li>\u201cI\u2019ve been wrestling with postmillennialism, amillennialism, and premillennialism eschatology and have been leaning towards post. I know it\u2019s not an essential of our faith but I was wondering what you guys can comment on this and any good resources as well.\u201d</li><li>\u201cAre you ever worried about how much influence you are having through the podcast?\u201d</li><li>\u201cIs justification by faith alone a first-tier (\"essentials\") issue in your view? It seems that many evangelicals do think so, but if so, how does that affect how we view people in church history like Thomas Aquinas, if this doctrine is an \"essential\" belief to be saved?\u201d</li><li>\u201cIs there a resource that charitably explains what different Christian denominations believe?\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhat is one of your favorite things about your fellow cohosts/friends/frohosts? How do they encourage you?\u201d</li><li>\u201cIs the Son the only person of the Trinity we see \"embodied\" (I'm not even sure if it's ok to use that word in relation to the Trinity at this point) in the scriptures or do we see the Father and the Spirit take on a form? For example, is the one Isaiah sees on the throne in Isaiah 6 the Son? The Father? The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? Outside of the incarnation, how do we apply good Trinitarian theology to moments when we see God taking on \"embodied\" forms like in Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Revelation or more general forms like the burning bush, pillar of cloud and fire, etc.?\u201d</li><li>\u201cI only recently came to understand that the resurrection of Jesus Christ actually changes my reality now (on this side of eternity). How should we think about the transformative power of the resurrection as it relates to the topic of besetting sins?\u201d</li><li>\u201cIs it important that Adam was a historical figure? If so, why?\u201d</li><li>\u201cEach of y\u2019all\u2019s simple tips for studying scripture on your own.\u201d</li><li>\u201cHistorically God has always had masculine pronouns but recently I\u2019ve noticed gender-neutral pronouns are being used more often (particularly in scholarly writings). Is our understanding of God as masculine or gender-neutral an important aspect of our relationship with God? How does that impact our view of men and women being made in the image of God?\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhen reading Acts, it seems like the apostles go out of their way to lay hands on new converts and ensure they are specifically filled/baptized with the Holy Spirit in a way that causes them to prophecy, speak in tongues, etc. This seems like an additional step, not synonymous with water baptism. The apostles didn\u2019t seem to think that we are filled upon conversion, but rather manually through specific prayer. As believers today, are we missing something? Should we be doing this after we baptize someone? Am I lacking the Spirit if I haven\u2019t been converted with this procedure?\u201d</li><li>\u201cIn Isaiah 9:6 Jesus Christ, the Son is referred to both as Son and as Everlasting Father...How does this work out in the Trinitarian community? Is there a lending of their titles? \u2018For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\u2019\u201d</li><li>\u201cIn the OT, the Angel of the Lord is often a Christophany. In Matthew 1:20 is this also a Christophany?\u201c</li><li>\u201cHow should Protestants read the early fathers if their leanings are more Catholic (the church)?\u00a0 Should we ignore their beliefs on Mary or communion?\u201d</li><li>\u201cReferences are made to the gift of tongues throughout the NT. There seem to be two types, one of which is speaking a known language, and the other which is a bit less clear - some sort of tongues of angels or heavenly language. Paul says in Corinthians not to forbid tongues. Why is this not commonly exercised in our circles? Are we missing out on some sort of joyous fellowship with the Spirit by not pursuing this, at least in personal prayer, if not in community with other saints?\u201d</li><li>\u201cCan you give a run through of some of the differences between dispensationalism and covenant theology. Are they in direct conflict with one another or can they be harmonized?\u201d</li><li>\u201cLately I\u2019ve had real difficulty accepting an impassible view of God, especially when considering the suffering of Jesus on the cross. It is hard for me to think that the Father, so intimately united with the Son, did not also suffer out of compassion for him. Did God feel nothing as he watched his son die? The last thing I gather from the incarnation/crucifixion is that the Father is apathetic, so my understanding of impassibility must be off. But I don\u2019t understand how God who is capable of love could be incapable of suffering or emotion, and I would love to hear y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts.\u201d</li><li>\u201cPer Scripture, is baptism presented as being a part of salvation? Or, put another way, is baptism when your sins are forgiven?\u201d</li><li>\u201cThanks for the JL Packer essay - Early in the essay Packer defines \"Unconditional election\" as God's free, sovereign, unconditional choice for sinners, as sinners to be redeemed.\u00a0 He then goes on to define \"Limited atonement\" as \"The redeeming work of Christ had as its end and goal the salvation of the elect.\"\u00a0 Is there any easy way to understand how this can be a free choice for sinners and yet you are also elect?\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhat advice would you give your 25-year-old self or a 25-year old Patron with a desire to pastor?\u201c</li><li>\u201cWhat would your recommendation be regarding the use of outside curriculum in your church classes/studies? How would you balance using outside resources as opposed to training up your own teachers and developing your own materials?\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhy does it say in Romans 5:15 \u201cmany\u201d died by the trespass of [Adam], versus everyone/all? Don\u2019t we all experience death and it\u2019s only through faith & allegiance to Christ that we can be born and experience true life again? Interestingly, almost all main translations have \u201cthe many.\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhat book of the Bible do you think you\u2019ve read/reread the most and what is it about that book that keeps drawing you back?\u201d</li><li>\u201cDo you all reject or affirm the concept of \u201cautotheos\u201d? Currently reading Arminian Theology by Roger Olson in order to have a more well rounded understanding.\u201d</li><li>Where do you think the line is for having a proper place of spiritual authority?</li><li>\u201cI am wondering all y'all's thoughts on the movement of evangelicals to embrace \"Torah Observance\" and return to keeping the OT law. In discussing this with a friend who is being drawn to this new (old) way of life, my thoughts have been on Paul's comments about the Law in Romans. She brought up 2 Peter 3:16-17 and Peter's comments about Paul's teaching being misunderstood and misapplied leading to \"lawlessness.\" I'd love to hear your thoughts! \u201c</li><li>\u201cIf we are continually be interceded for by God the Son (Jesus), are those who were spoken to by God in the Old Testament being spoken to from God the Son, or God the Father? The New Testament seems to suggest that we only have access to the Father through the Son, but I often hear people talk about God\u2019s words spoken to the prophets as coming from God the Father. How should we think about the trinitys function in the Old Testament, specifically concerning God speaking to men?\u201c</li><li>What recommendations or resources can you suggest to help women who want to grow their skills leading small group discussion?</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>Eternally Begotten: The Son\u2019s unique attribute in relation to the Father and the Spirit: the Son is sourced in the Father, but there was never a time when the Son began. All things are from the Father, through the Son and by the Spirit.</li><li>Eternally Unbegotten: The Father is without origin (never been born, made, or created) and He is the fount of divinity.</li><li>Archetypal Knowledge: Knowledge of God that God himself only possesses; true and full.</li><li>Ectypal Knowledge: Our knowledge of God is true but not full because of our finitude.</li><li>Chiasm: Is a literary technique that has bookend statements that work their way inward.</li><li>Christophany: An appearance of the Son of God before the incarnation.</li><li>The resurrection power of Christ means that we have been delivered from the penalty of sin. The resurrection power of Christ means that we are currently being delivered from sin\u2019s power and the resurrection power of Christ means one day we will be delivered from sin's presence.</li><li>Autotheos: Self existence of God.</li></ul><p>Resources Mentioned in This Episode:</p><ul><li>Revelation 21:22-25, 1 John 1:5, Genesis 2:3, Genesis 3:24, 1 John 2:1, Isaiah 9:6, John 10:30, Matthew 1:20, Romans 5:15, John 13-17, Hebrews 1, John 15:26</li><li><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/knowingfaith\">patreon.com/knowingfaith</a></li><li><a href=\"https://bibleproject.com/\">The Bible Project</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801015502/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=trainingthech-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0801015502&linkId=a1f986d3e9606edb4cd14cafb01ab6a2\">\u201cA Case for Amillennialism\u201d</a> by Kim Riddlebarger</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0875523897/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=trainingthech-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0875523897&linkId=b4fa1be78de11d56a6afaad50113c881\">\u201cPostmillennialism\u201d</a> By Keith A.

All things are from the Father, through the Son and by the Spirit.\nEternally Unbegotten: The Father is without origin (never been born, made, or created) and He is the fount of divinity.\nArchetypal Knowledge: Knowledge of God that God himself only possesses; true and full.\nEctypal Knowledge: Our knowledge of God is true but not full because of our finitude.\nChiasm: Is a literary technique that has bookend statements that work their way inward.\nChristophany: An appearance of the Son of God before the incarnation.\nThe resurrection power of Christ means that we have been delivered from the penalty of sin. The resurrection power of Christ means that we are currently being delivered from sin\u2019s power and the resurrection power of Christ means one day we will be delivered from sin's presence.\nAutotheos: Self existence of God.\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\nRevelation 21:22-25, 1 John 1:5, Genesis 2:3, Genesis 3:24, 1 John 2:1, Isaiah 9:6, John 10:30, Matthew 1:20, Romans 5:15, John 13-17, Hebrews 1, John 15:26\npatreon.com/knowingfaith\nThe Bible Project\n\u201cA Case for Amillennialism\u201d by Kim Riddlebarger\n\u201cPostmillennialism\u201d By Keith A.

To learn more and become a patron visit patreon.com/knowingfaith.\nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\n\u201cDo you have recommendations for books/podcasts/resources/etc for doing something similar but age appropriate for older kids?\u201d\n\u201cIs the language about God being Father & Son literal or figurative or both?\u201d\n\u201cAre we ever at risk of reading too much into parallels, types, significant numbers etc. and drawing conclusions that weren\u2019t intended as we attempt to comprehend and interpret on our own?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think that in the New Creation there will be no darkness (Rev. 21:22-25) yet in the first creation, before there was sin, God created darkness and light? 1 Jn 1:5 says there is no darkness in God, but why then did God create night in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cRegarding Gen 3:24. What happened to the garden, the cherubim & flaming sword after Adam and Eve left? What happened to the tree of life or tree of knowledge of good & evil?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is a theological belief or tradition that you used to hold too firmly but changed your mind (or at least you are no longer as confident in)?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wrestling with postmillennialism, amillennialism, and premillennialism eschatology and have been leaning towards post. I know it\u2019s not an essential of our faith but I was wondering what you guys can comment on this and any good resources as well.\u201d\n\u201cAre you ever worried about how much influence you are having through the podcast?\u201d\n\u201cIs justification by faith alone a first-tier (\"essentials\") issue in your view? It seems that many evangelicals do think so, but if so, how does that affect how we view people in church history like Thomas Aquinas, if this doctrine is an \"essential\" belief to be saved?\u201d\n\u201cIs there a resource that charitably explains what different Christian denominations believe?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is one of your favorite things about your fellow cohosts/friends/frohosts? How do they encourage you?\u201d\n\u201cIs the Son the only person of the Trinity we see \"embodied\" (I'm not even sure if it's ok to use that word in relation to the Trinity at this point) in the scriptures or do we see the Father and the Spirit take on a form? For example, is the one Isaiah sees on the throne in Isaiah 6 the Son? The Father? The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? Outside of the incarnation, how do we apply good Trinitarian theology to moments when we see God taking on \"embodied\" forms like in Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Revelation or more general forms like the burning bush, pillar of cloud and fire, etc.?\u201d\n\u201cI only recently came to understand that the resurrection of Jesus Christ actually changes my reality now (on this side of eternity). How should we think about the transformative power of the resurrection as it relates to the topic of besetting sins?\u201d\n\u201cIs it important that Adam was a historical figure? If so, why?\u201d\n\u201cEach of y\u2019all\u2019s simple tips for studying scripture on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHistorically God has always had masculine pronouns but recently I\u2019ve noticed gender-neutral pronouns are being used more often (particularly in scholarly writings). Is our understanding of God as masculine or gender-neutral an important aspect of our relationship with God? How does that impact our view of men and women being made in the image of God?\u201d\n\u201cWhen reading Acts, it seems like the apostles go out of their way to lay hands on new converts and ensure they are specifically filled/baptized with the Holy Spirit in a way that causes them to prophecy, speak in tongues, etc. This seems like an additional step, not synonymous with water baptism. The apostles didn\u2019t seem to think that we are filled upon conversion, but rather manually through specific prayer. As believers today, are we missing something? Should we be doing this after we baptize someone? Am I lacking the Spirit if I haven\u2019t been converted with this procedure?\u201d\n\u201cIn Isaiah 9:6 Jesus Christ, the Son is referred to both as Son and as Everlasting Father...How does this work out in the Trinitarian community? Is there a lending of their titles? \u2018For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIn the OT, the Angel of the Lord is often a Christophany. In Matthew 1:20 is this also a Christophany?\u201c\n\u201cHow should Protestants read the early fathers if their leanings are more Catholic (the church)?\u00a0 Should we ignore their beliefs on Mary or communion?\u201d\n\u201cReferences are made to the gift of tongues throughout the NT. There seem to be two types, one of which is speaking a known language, and the other which is a bit less clear - some sort of tongues of angels or heavenly language. Paul says in Corinthians not to forbid tongues. Why is this not commonly exercised in our circles? Are we missing out on some sort of joyous fellowship with the Spirit by not pursuing this, at least in personal prayer, if not in community with other saints?\u201d\n\u201cCan you give a run through of some of the differences between dispensationalism and covenant theology. Are they in direct conflict with one another or can they be harmonized?\u201d\n\u201cLately I\u2019ve had real difficulty accepting an impassible view of God, especially when considering the suffering of Jesus on the cross. It is hard for me to think that the Father, so intimately united with the Son, did not also suffer out of compassion for him. Did God feel nothing as he watched his son die? The last thing I gather from the incarnation/crucifixion is that the Father is apathetic, so my understanding of impassibility must be off. But I don\u2019t understand how God who is capable of love could be incapable of suffering or emotion, and I would love to hear y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts.\u201d\n\u201cPer Scripture, is baptism presented as being a part of salvation? Or, put another way, is baptism when your sins are forgiven?\u201d\n\u201cThanks for the JL Packer essay - Early in the essay Packer defines \"Unconditional election\" as God's free, sovereign, unconditional choice for sinners, as sinners to be redeemed.\u00a0 He then goes on to define \"Limited atonement\" as \"The redeeming work of Christ had as its end and goal the salvation of the elect.\"\u00a0 Is there any easy way to understand how this can be a free choice for sinners and yet you are also elect?\u201d\n\u201cWhat advice would you give your 25-year-old self or a 25-year old Patron with a desire to pastor?\u201c\n\u201cWhat would your recommendation be regarding the use of outside curriculum in your church classes/studies? How would you balance using outside resources as opposed to training up your own teachers and developing your own materials?\u201d\n\u201cWhy does it say in Romans 5:15 \u201cmany\u201d died by the trespass of [Adam], versus everyone/all? Don\u2019t we all experience death and it\u2019s only through faith & allegiance to Christ that we can be born and experience true life again? Interestingly, almost all main translations have \u201cthe many.\u201d\n\u201cWhat book of the Bible do you think you\u2019ve read/reread the most and what is it about that book that keeps drawing you back?\u201d\n\u201cDo you all reject or affirm the concept of \u201cautotheos\u201d? Currently reading Arminian Theology by Roger Olson in order to have a more well rounded understanding.\u201d\nWhere do you think the line is for having a proper place of spiritual authority?\n\u201cI am wondering all y'all's thoughts on the movement of evangelicals to embrace \"Torah Observance\" and return to keeping the OT law. In discussing this with a friend who is being drawn to this new (old) way of life, my thoughts have been on Paul's comments about the Law in Romans. She brought up 2 Peter 3:16-17 and Peter's comments about Paul's teaching being misunderstood and misapplied leading to \"lawlessness.\" I'd love to hear your thoughts! \u201c\n\u201cIf we are continually be interceded for by God the Son (Jesus), are those who were spoken to by God in the Old Testament being spoken to from God the Son, or God the Father? The New Testament seems to suggest that we only have access to the Father through the Son, but I often hear people talk about God\u2019s words spoken to the prophets as coming from God the Father. How should we think about the trinitys function in the Old Testament, specifically concerning God speaking to men?\u201c\nWhat recommendations or resources can you suggest to help women who want to grow their skills leading small group discussion?\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nEternally Begotten: The Son\u2019s unique attribute in relation to the Father and the Spirit: the Son is sourced in the Father, but there was never a time when the Son began.

            "contentSnippet": "Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley answer questions from listeners.\nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\n\u201cJen, I have heard you at least twice talk about situations where it\u2019s ok to lie \u2192 I think you used the phrase \u201ctruth to whom truth is due\u201d \u2192 How does that fit with scriptures' admonitions against lying? You guys are some of the best bible teachers I know so obviously you're not saying to just lie whenever. Please help! Thanks Jen for all the work you do keeping JT and Kyle in line and on track!\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think of the conversations about how we should not refer to ourselves as sinners once we\u2019re saved?\u201d\nWho is having this argument?\n\u201cJT, if God knew his plan of unconditional election would send the majority of people he created to hell, why did he create man at all?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your best marriage advice?\u201d\nWhat do you think of the idea of dating your spouse?\n\u201cThoughts on Christians reading apocryphal documents?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your favorite book that you read in 2021, and what books are you reading now?\u201d\n\u201cHow should believers regard secular art/entertainment with obviously biblical themes? I watched Dune this weekend and found it to have a lot of biblical themes. Are all works of art/entertainment just outworkings of the ultimate story of the bible?\u201d\n\u201cHow would you clearly define the gospel?\u201d\n\u201cMy six year old wants to know if we will see the Holy Spirit in heaven?\u201d\n\u201cJT, what was the title of your PhD thesis and can you summarize it in a few sentences?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between women teaching in the church and pastoring?\u201d\n\u201cThe concept of predestination is really confusing. Could you explain its basic tenets?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about being in ministry?\u201d\nBest books on church planting?\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nSinner: One who is separated from God, alienated, fundamentally unrighteous, and in Adam or under the federal headship of Adam.\nApocryphal Documents: Noncanonical documents (or books) that are related to the history of stories you might find in the Bible, adjacently, directly or indirectly, that speak to some of the issues of the Jewish people. For example: the intertestamental period, 1 & 2 Maccabees.\nThe Gospel: Life, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension of Christ mean that I am free from sin's penalty, I am being freed from sin\u2019s power, and I will one day be free from sin's presence.\nPredestination: God chose a people for himself (Romans 9, Genesis 12) so that he might receive glory among all peoples, all nations, all tribes, forever.\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\nExodus 1:15-22, Hebrews 10:14, Romans 9:19-23, John 3:16, 1 Timothy 3 , Titus 1, Genesis 12\n\u201cGrant\u201d by Ron Chernow\n\u201cBand of Brothers\u201d HBO Series\n\u201cExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close\u201d by Jonathan Safran Foer\n\u201cJesus and John Wayne\u201d by Kristin Kobes Du Mez\n\u201cThe Lymond Chronicles\u201d by Dorothy Dunnentt\n\u201cThe Red Rising Series\u201d by Pierce Brown\n\u201cLive No Lies\u201d by John Mark Comer\n\u201cBand of Brothers\u201d by Stephen E.

            "contentSnippet": "Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley are joined by author, Bible teacher, conference, and retreat speaker Courtney Doctor. Together they discuss Romans 6:1-14 and union with Christ.\nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\nPaul\u2019s use of rhetorical questions to advance his argument: \u201cWhat shall we say then?\u201d Why would Paul ask and answer this question at this point?\nShould we understand this to mean that if you are a Christian you can\u2019t sin and if you sin you couldn\u2019t possibly be a Christian?\nWhat does it mean to be \u201cbaptized into Christ Jesus?\u201d\nWhat is the doctrine of union with Christ?\nHow is this tied to the actual historical events of Christ?\nHow do we consider ourselves \u201cdead to sin?\u201d\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nUnion with Christ: When we are in Christ, all that he has done, all that he has accomplished; those become ours too. It is our salvation; he saves us by uniting us to himself in a way that what has happened to him; his death, his burial, his resurrection, his victory over sin, it is in Christ that those are ours.\nHistorio Saludis: History of salvation accomplished.\nOrdo Saludis: Salvation accomplished and applied.\n\nGuest Bio:\nCourtney Doctor is an author, Bible teacher, frequent conference and retreat speaker, and periodic blogger. She received an MDiv from Covenant Theological Seminary in 2013 and is the author of From Garden to Glory: A Bible Study on the Bible\u2019s Story; Steadfast: A Devotional Bible Study on the Book of James); and In View of God's Mercies: The Gift of the Gospel in Romans (coming soon).

            "content": "<p>Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley answer questions submitted by patrons of Knowing Faith.</p><p>Questions Covered in This Episode:</p><ul><li>In the book of Proverbs, in times where wisdom is personified, is it fair to read that as if Christ himself is speaking or being described since he is the perfect embodiment of the wisdom of God? It seems the most obvious in chapters 1, 8, and 9. Are there any misinterpretations possible in seeing those passages purely as words of Christ?</li><li>Is some sort of ministry/biblical studies degree important/helpful for leaders in the local church? (Aside from the pastor.)</li><li>How does the book of Job fit in with the story of Genesis? Does it?</li><li>What is one intentional thing you have done with your young children where you really felt you saw fruit from it in later years?</li><li>Can you give some insight on Molinism and how that coincides with or goes against the Reformed position?\u00a0</li><li>When I was a kid growing up in a Baptist church, it was always the pastor who baptized people. I have noticed that occasionally the pastors at other churches in our community will allow others to baptize people. I am just curious when that shift came and does the Bible have any specifics on who can baptize?</li><li>One of the things I appreciate so much about y'all is how unashamedly trinitarian you are and how unashamedly trinitarian you encourage Christians to be. It seems as if part of this is to view every act of God in the Bible as something in which the whole trinity is involved. While one person may be the primary agent, there is still involvement from the other two persons. So, my question along those lines is what was the work of the Holy Spirit at the crucifixion? Romans 8 talks about the Father giving up the son. John 10 and 1 John 3 talks about Jesus laying down his life for the glory of the Father, but there seems to be no mention of what the Spirit was doing or how He was acting in the crucifixion. How then do we see the crucifixion as an act of the entire trinity?</li><li>Y'all have alluded to the uniqueness of the preaching event on Sunday mornings, specifically as it relates to complementarianism - what exactly do you mean by that? Why do we believe that the worship service & preaching event on Sunday mornings is unique?</li><li>How do you regard the LXX (in terms of translation accuracy)? Is it essentially equivalent to English translations or should we give it extra weight?</li><li>Since you are fans of The West Wing, I am curious if you\u2019ve seen Newsroom.</li><li>Best books (in addition to the Bible) for someone who has been a Christian for years but is new to reformed theology?\u00a0</li><li>Do you have any tips for facilitating deeper and more open discussion at Bible study?</li><li>How do you evaluate the effectiveness of women\u2019s Bible studies and determine when to make changes when the same format has been in place for 20+ years?</li><li>How do you understand the word/title \u201cLord/kurios\u201d in NT vs. OT? In the NT, it seems almost always a title applied to Jesus. In the OT (LXX), \u201cLord/kurios'' is also used in place of \u201cYahweh\u201d. Should we be making some special connection there? (I.e. connecting Jesus and Yahweh) How should we understand this trinitarianly? Also, any thoughts about \u201cYahweh\u201d (God\u2019s personal name) being replaced with \u201cLord/kurios\u201d (a title) in the LXX? (Do you think they were correct that we should not say \u201cYahweh/YHWH\u201d because it is too holy?)</li><li>Is it possible to idolize the Bible?</li><li>I\u2019m curious as to what your take is on what seems to be a movement towards lessening (in some sense) some of the OT miracles of God. The primary example I can point to is within the translation of the Red Sea as a \u201csea of reeds.\u201d Lately, I feel like this has been presented as yes God did part a body of water, but it wasn\u2019t really the Red Sea as we know, and while a miracle it was something far less impressive. The second example I can think of is the fall of Jericho as simply 6-foot mud walls in a small, vulnerable military outpost.</li><li>\u00a0I just finished JT\u2019s book. I would love to hear an example of how JT could see this working in a small church of around 100.</li><li>\u00a0I think the conversation on Christophany is interesting. I\u2019m just curious about this: if what appeared to Abraham or Hagar or in the furnace or whatever was a pre-incarnate Jesus, why is it important to call this the Son and not Jesus?</li><li>What are some good ways to discuss sexual ethics with nonbelievers? A family member recently left the church because they found popular sexual ethics (LGTQ+, trans, and personal \u201cfreedom\u201d) to be more just and fair than biblical sexual ethics. They did this without personal lifestyle motivation; they\u2019re in a happy marriage. Quoting Bible verses doesn\u2019t help nonbelievers because they disagree with those verses. What is a good logical way to explain God\u2019s plan for sexuality without simply saying \u201cbecause God said so\u201d? That doesn\u2019t lead to discussion or convince people because they think it\u2019s arbitrary and judgmental.</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>Molinism: God possesses knowledge not merely of all that is, all that isn\u2019t, but all that could be. This knowledge is called middle knowledge. All the maybes and what-ifs. Luis de Molina proposed this idea as a way of helping reconcile free will and God's sovereignty. God could see every potential world that could possibly exist and subsequently chose to actualize a world in which there was the maximum amount of human free will and the minimum amount of evil as collateral damage. He could do this because he doesn\u2019t just know the world that is, he doesn\u2019t just know the world that isn\u2019t, he knows every possible world that could be and he has chosen to actualize that world.\u00a0</li><li>Trinitarianism: God eternally exists as one essence in three distinct persons, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, each of whom is fully God, yet there is One God.</li><li>LXX or Septuagint: Greek translation of the Old Testament</li><li>Natural Law Tradition: A very robust way of talking about human design that does not rely on the evidences of scripture.

            "content:encoded": "<p>Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley answer questions submitted by patrons of Knowing Faith.</p><p>Questions Covered in This Episode:</p><ul><li>In the book of Proverbs, in times where wisdom is personified, is it fair to read that as if Christ himself is speaking or being described since he is the perfect embodiment of the wisdom of God? It seems the most obvious in chapters 1, 8, and 9. Are there any misinterpretations possible in seeing those passages purely as words of Christ?</li><li>Is some sort of ministry/biblical studies degree important/helpful for leaders in the local church? (Aside from the pastor.)</li><li>How does the book of Job fit in with the story of Genesis? Does it?</li><li>What is one intentional thing you have done with your young children where you really felt you saw fruit from it in later years?</li><li>Can you give some insight on Molinism and how that coincides with or goes against the Reformed position?\u00a0</li><li>When I was a kid growing up in a Baptist church, it was always the pastor who baptized people. I have noticed that occasionally the pastors at other churches in our community will allow others to baptize people. I am just curious when that shift came and does the Bible have any specifics on who can baptize?</li><li>One of the things I appreciate so much about y'all is how unashamedly trinitarian you are and how unashamedly trinitarian you encourage Christians to be. It seems as if part of this is to view every act of God in the Bible as something in which the whole trinity is involved. While one person may be the primary agent, there is still involvement from the other two persons. So, my question along those lines is what was the work of the Holy Spirit at the crucifixion? Romans 8 talks about the Father giving up the son. John 10 and 1 John 3 talks about Jesus laying down his life for the glory of the Father, but there seems to be no mention of what the Spirit was doing or how He was acting in the crucifixion. How then do we see the crucifixion as an act of the entire trinity?</li><li>Y'all have alluded to the uniqueness of the preaching event on Sunday mornings, specifically as it relates to complementarianism - what exactly do you mean by that? Why do we believe that the worship service & preaching event on Sunday mornings is unique?</li><li>How do you regard the LXX (in terms of translation accuracy)? Is it essentially equivalent to English translations or should we give it extra weight?</li><li>Since you are fans of The West Wing, I am curious if you\u2019ve seen Newsroom.</li><li>Best books (in addition to the Bible) for someone who has been a Christian for years but is new to reformed theology?\u00a0</li><li>Do you have any tips for facilitating deeper and more open discussion at Bible study?</li><li>How do you evaluate the effectiveness of women\u2019s Bible studies and determine when to make changes when the same format has been in place for 20+ years?</li><li>How do you understand the word/title \u201cLord/kurios\u201d in NT vs. OT? In the NT, it seems almost always a title applied to Jesus. In the OT (LXX), \u201cLord/kurios'' is also used in place of \u201cYahweh\u201d. Should we be making some special connection there? (I.e. connecting Jesus and Yahweh) How should we understand this trinitarianly? Also, any thoughts about \u201cYahweh\u201d (God\u2019s personal name) being replaced with \u201cLord/kurios\u201d (a title) in the LXX? (Do you think they were correct that we should not say \u201cYahweh/YHWH\u201d because it is too holy?)</li><li>Is it possible to idolize the Bible?</li><li>I\u2019m curious as to what your take is on what seems to be a movement towards lessening (in some sense) some of the OT miracles of God. The primary example I can point to is within the translation of the Red Sea as a \u201csea of reeds.\u201d Lately, I feel like this has been presented as yes God did part a body of water, but it wasn\u2019t really the Red Sea as we know, and while a miracle it was something far less impressive. The second example I can think of is the fall of Jericho as simply 6-foot mud walls in a small, vulnerable military outpost.</li><li>\u00a0I just finished JT\u2019s book. I would love to hear an example of how JT could see this working in a small church of around 100.</li><li>\u00a0I think the conversation on Christophany is interesting. I\u2019m just curious about this: if what appeared to Abraham or Hagar or in the furnace or whatever was a pre-incarnate Jesus, why is it important to call this the Son and not Jesus?</li><li>What are some good ways to discuss sexual ethics with nonbelievers? A family member recently left the church because they found popular sexual ethics (LGTQ+, trans, and personal \u201cfreedom\u201d) to be more just and fair than biblical sexual ethics. They did this without personal lifestyle motivation; they\u2019re in a happy marriage. Quoting Bible verses doesn\u2019t help nonbelievers because they disagree with those verses. What is a good logical way to explain God\u2019s plan for sexuality without simply saying \u201cbecause God said so\u201d? That doesn\u2019t lead to discussion or convince people because they think it\u2019s arbitrary and judgmental.</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>Molinism: God possesses knowledge not merely of all that is, all that isn\u2019t, but all that could be. This knowledge is called middle knowledge. All the maybes and what-ifs. Luis de Molina proposed this idea as a way of helping reconcile free will and God's sovereignty. God could see every potential world that could possibly exist and subsequently chose to actualize a world in which there was the maximum amount of human free will and the minimum amount of evil as collateral damage. He could do this because he doesn\u2019t just know the world that is, he doesn\u2019t just know the world that isn\u2019t, he knows every possible world that could be and he has chosen to actualize that world.\u00a0</li><li>Trinitarianism: God eternally exists as one essence in three distinct persons, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, each of whom is fully God, yet there is One God.</li><li>LXX or Septuagint: Greek translation of the Old Testament</li><li>Natural Law Tradition: A very robust way of talking about human design that does not rely on the evidences of scripture. A way of reasoning that is informed as much by the laws of logic as it is by the witness of scripture. Example: The law of noncontradiction states that something cannot be A and non-A at the very same time.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Resources Mentioned in This Episode:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/knowingfaithpodcast?listId=29ORS3FVPRNLK&ref=cm_sw_em_r_inf_list_own_knowingfaithpodcast_dp_HDG6qq5bHmqi2\">Romans Resources</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/143356629X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=trainingthech-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=143356629X&linkId=e4815b668c406dcf62d31525121f086f\">\u201cFamily Discipleship\u201d</a> by Matt Chandler and Adam Griffin\u00a0</li><li>Family Discipleship Podcast: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FamDisciplePod\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/familydiscipleshippodcast/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheFamilyDiscipleshipPodcast\">Facebook</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0842313354/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=trainingthech-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0842313354&linkId=c370d9678ea4c6d8ae48a1da35a12b22\">\u201cChosen by God\u201d</a> by R.C.

Some suggest it\u2019s not a biblical tool.</li><li>Is it wrong to present Bible stories to Kids in ways that leave open room for misinterpretation solely to make it more palatable? For example, not mentioning the massive loss of life during the flood...</li><li>What\u2019s happening when Jesus breathes on the disciples in John 20?</li><li>Should worship leaders include spontaneous worship into a Sunday service? Or is that reserved for personal worship only?</li><li>Why, in Ps 51:4 does David say \"against you only have I sinned,\" when he clearly has sinned against both Bathsheba and Uriah?

            "contentSnippet": "Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley answer listener questions and continue their debate on Christophanies.\nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\nLots of questions on Instagram about the Enneagram: How should we approach the Enneagram? Some suggest it\u2019s not a biblical tool.\nIs it wrong to present Bible stories to Kids in ways that leave open room for misinterpretation solely to make it more palatable? For example, not mentioning the massive loss of life during the flood...\nWhat\u2019s happening when Jesus breathes on the disciples in John 20?\nShould worship leaders include spontaneous worship into a Sunday service? Or is that reserved for personal worship only?\nWhy, in Ps 51:4 does David say \"against you only have I sinned,\" when he clearly has sinned against both Bathsheba and Uriah? How can I make sense of this?\nWhat are common decisions and ways churches unknowingly undermine a healthy ecclesiology?\nThanks for the show notes! What are some good resources for connecting the family lines, relationships, & blessings/curses from the OT through to the NT? What can help me not miss the references original readers would have understood?\nCan we get a last exchange on Christophanies and Theophanies?\nIn light of Genesis, take your pick. Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo? On a more serious note. If you were to teach a Bible study through Mark\u2019s Gospel, what are some overarching themes and ideas you would want to emphasize?\nBest/most accessible books on church history for the lay Christian?\nOne is the #1 book or resource you wish you would have had/used/read early in your ministry (1st year) rather than later?\nWhat are helpful responses when participants in church discipleship programs and bible studies consistently don\u2019t do the homework?\nCan young children of believers partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper along with their parents?\nWhat is the difference between God\u2019s presence in Eden/Tabernacle/Temple and his omnipresence?\nWhat\u2019s a novel or story outside of scripture that has had an impact on your life or worldview?\nWhat is the discipline of God? Is it us living with the consequences of sin or something more?\nWhat is the most frequent question each of you receive?\nFavorite chips and dip?\nIf you could only eat one dessert for the rest of your life, what would it be?\nWhat are we studying next year?\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nEcclesiology: Doctrine of the church.\nChristophany: An appearance of the Son of God before the incarnation.\nSpecial (Redemptive or Blessed) Presence: God directs his blessed presence to particular places at particular times throughout the Old Testament and in the New Testament is demonstrated through the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit.

            "content": "<p>Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley explore how to think about global crises and what the Bible says about the \u201clast days.\u201d</p><p>Questions Covered in This Episode:</p><ul><li>It is not uncommon, in the face of global crises, for conversations to pick back up regarding the end times, the last day, the end of the world, the 2nd coming of Christ. Have you heard this or felt it during these strange days of the world reeling from the COVID pandemic?</li><li>Why does it seem like people are drawn to this question/idea?</li><li>How do you respond when someone asks you, \u201cAre we living in the end times?\u201d</li><li>Is Jesus's return imminent?</li><li>Should we live as though his return is imminent? What does that look like?</li><li>What are the different views on the end times?</li><li>What are the essential beliefs about the end of the world?</li><li>Q&A:</li><li>What is the significance of the daughters of Zelophehad, historian numbers, why would that provision have already been in the law?</li><li>How would I talk about the end times with high school students?</li><li>What is orthodox belief?</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>False Stories: All of us are living in the midst of a narrative that informs us on what the good life is. By default all of us are living in false stories and need to be invited to participate in the true story - the Christian story.</li><li>Progressivism: The story that says, \u201cThings are continually getting better.\u201d Advancements in science, technology, economics, etc., are constantly improving the human condition. The good life is the belief that through human ingenuity, we are better today than yesterday and we will be better tomorrow than we were today.</li><li>Pre-Millennialism: The view on the end times that we are existing prior to a millennial reign of Christ Jesus, it typically treats the millennial reign as a defined 1,000 year period that will occur. Within this view there are different views on the rapture and tribulation.</li><li>Amillennialism: The view on the end times that the millennial rule and reign of Christ is a real thing but doesn\u2019t have a time signature.

How can our views on the gifts of the Spirit be strengthened by deeper reflection on the person of the Spirit?\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nEternal Procession: The Holy Spirit\u2019s unique attribute in relation to the Father and Son: He has always come from the Father and the Son and will continue to do so forever. All things are from the Father, through the Son and by the Spirit.\nEternally Begotten: The Son\u2019s unique attribute in relation to the Father and the Spirit: the Son is sourced in the Father, but there was never a time when the Son began. All things are from the Father, through the Son and by the Spirit.\u00a0\nChristology: The eternally begotten Son, who shares in the divine nature assumed upon Himself a fully human nature in the incarnation.

They talk about what \"sin\" and \"forgiveness\" mean.\nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\nWhy are we looking at the creed? What is the creed? When is the creed? Why does it matter for us?\nToday turning our attention to: \u201cthe forgiveness of sins.\u201d Is it significant that this line is here?\nWhat is sin? Is there a difference between sin and sins?\nWhat is original sin? Total depravity?\nHow has sin impacted me, us, the world?\nWhat is forgiveness?\nHow can I be forgiven? How am I forgiven?\n\nThe Apostles\u2019 Creed:\nI believe in God, the Father Almighty,\ncreator of heaven and earth,\nI believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,\nwho was conceived by the Holy Spirit\nand born of the virgin Mary.\nHe suffered under Pontius Pilate,\nwas crucified, died, and was buried;\nHe descended to hell.\nThe third day He rose again from the dead.\nHe ascended to heaven\u00a0\nand is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.\nFrom there He will come to judge the living and the dead.\nI believe in the Holy Spirit,\nthe holy catholic church,\nthe communion of saints,\nthe forgiveness of sins,\nthe resurrection of the body,\nand the life everlasting. Amen.\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nSin: \u201cSin is lawlessness in relation to God as lawgiver, rebellion in relation to God as rightful ruler, missing the mark in relation to God as our designer, guilt in relation to God as judge, and unclean in relation to God as the holy one.

How were people able to write under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit if they were not indwelt with the Spirit?</li><li>What do you think is the biggest need is for college kids?</li><li>When a church fills a pastoral vacancy with someone who is outside of where the church has been theologically or denominationally, what do you do when there are differences? Should you stay or go somewhere else?</li><li>How do we reconcile the prevalent evil that has prevailed? Do we just let it be, or do we continue to voice objections?</li><li>Kyle, what was your original tagline for Mosaic Church?</li><li>If a 12-year-old asks what is the difference between a Christian man and a Christian woman, what would you say?</li><li>Recently there have been discussions over complementarianism in the SBC. There was recently an incident with John Macarthur and Beth Moore. What are you guys going to say about this?</li><li>What are the benefits or dangers of reading the apocryphal or non-canonical writings?</li><li>General-purpose commentaries or resources for bible study and teaching?</li><li>Can we speak of Jesus Christ as eternally existent or just the Son only?</li><li>What would you say to a friend who says they don\u2019t need any other sources for spiritual growth outside of scripture?</li><li>The difference between the Son being eternally begotten and eternally subordinate?</li><li>Is the bible only inerrant in its original manuscripts and what does this mean for trusting the bibles we have?</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>Solo Scriptura: Scripture alone.</li><li>Sola Scriptura: By Scripture alone. The Bible alone is authoritative but we need tradition to come alongside to help us become better readers.</li><li>Eternally Begotten: The Son\u2019s unique attribute in relation to the Father and the Spirit: the Son is sourced in the Father, but there was never a time when the Son began.

Why does the creed start with God?\nWhat does it mean that God is Father (almighty)?\nWhy include that God is Creator?\u00a0\nWhat does it mean that he is Father theologically?\n\nThe Apostles Creed:\nI believe in God, the Father Almighty,\ncreator of heaven and earth,\nI believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,\nwho was conceived by the Holy Spirit\nand born of the virgin Mary.\nHe suffered under Pontius Pilate,\nwas crucified, died, and was buried;\nHe descended to hell.\nThe third day He rose again from the dead.\nHe ascended to heaven\u00a0\nand is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.\nFrom there He will come to judge the living and the dead.\nI believe in the Holy Spirit,\nthe holy catholic church,\nthe communion of saints,\nthe forgiveness of sins,\nthe resurrection of the body,\nand the life everlasting. Amen.\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nSola Scriptura: By Scripture alone.

For Presbyterians in your spheres, is catechesis still important? How does it work itself out in the homes and churches of Presbyterian families?</li><li>How should we think about catechizing our children into distinctly christian beliefs and orthodoxy?</li><li>Talk to me about baptizing babies. What am I missing? Is this just a natural outgrowth of covenantal theology? Are we, those who want to embrace a covenantal perspective but not baptize children, the inconsistent ones?</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>Ecclesiology: The doctrine of the church.</li><li>Sacramentum: The epaulet or badge that would be worn on a Roman army officer's uniform.

How should we prioritize exercise and healthy food choices?\nAs Christians, are we able to live without sinning?\nDoes God speak to us through thoughts in our mind? For example, we ask God something, and the first thought that pops in our head is from Him?\nIs there an age of accountability?\nLord\u2019s Supper: Who takes it, how often, and why?\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nCommunication of Attributes: The relationship between the two natures and the one person of Jesus Christ. Jesus has all of the attributes of his divine nature and all of the attributes of his human nature.\u00a0\nNestorianism: A Nestorian would admit the full deity of Christ. They would also affirm the full humanity of the person of Christ. It looks as if this is orthodox because they admit to both the full deity and full humanity but unfortunately they would not proclaim the unity of the person.They segregated the humanity from the deity.

Listen to the crew discuss (and debate) topics like how we should read passages about Israel in 2018 or why God seems to be silent about the treatment of women\u2026</p><p>Questions Covered in This Episode:</p><ul><li>Are Israel and the Church the same in the New covenant? How should we read passages about Israel in 2018? Do they relate to current events in the state of Israel?</li><li>Why does God seem to be silent in the OT regarding the treatment of women/multiple wives/treating women like property? There is harsh punishment for other things\u2026</li><li>What will the role of the Holy Spirit be in eternity?\u00a0</li><li>Kyle, what brand of toothpaste do you use? What brand of laundry detergent does Kyle use to get the toothpaste out of his shirt?\u00a0</li><li>How can we understand God\u2019s moral will versus His sovereign will?
