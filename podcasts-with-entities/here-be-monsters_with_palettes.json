Do enough people want to be composted to have it be a viable business model? Each of these companies have different approaches to their process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Return Home\u2019s model relies on scale.&nbsp; They wouldn\u2019t disclose the exact cost of building their facility, or how many simultaneous descendants they\u2019d need in their facility to be profitable.&nbsp; As of publishing, they charge $4,950 for their process and they have 15 of their 74 slots occupied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And in some ways, the full ecological benefits for Return Home\u2019s process also rely on scale.&nbsp; In a follow up email, CEO Micah Truman stated that \u201cWe calculate our inputs as follows. Our electricity bill each month is about $1,700, and is sufficient to Terramate 74 bodies. This comes to $22 per body. In current gas terms ($5 a gallon at present) that is roughly 4 gallons of gas, which is about 1/8 the amount of gas used for cremation.

            "contentSnippet": "What do you want to happen to your body when you die?\u00a0 It\u2019s a touchy topic where tradition, religion and death denial all come into play.\u00a0 But across much of the world, there are just two options: burial and cremation, which both have substantial ecological impacts.\u00a0\nIn 2019, Washington State passed SB 5001, which legalized several new options for deathcare.\u00a0\nIn this episode, host Jeff Emtman visits Return Home, a facility in Auburn, Washington that\u2019s using one of those new options, called \u201cNatural Organic Reduction\u201d (NOR) which is commonly called \u201chuman composting\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\nReturn Home has built the world\u2019s largest NOR facility to date, with 74 available individual vessels.\u00a0 Their process (which they\u2019ve trademarked as \u201cTerramation\u201d) takes about two month to complete, and involves dressing a deceased person in a pressed cotton gown and placing them a bed of organic material, and left to naturally break down using active composting techniques that bring the contents of the vessel to well above 100\u00b0 Fahrenheit for much of the composting period.\u00a0\nThe techniques used by Return Home were largely inspired by Katrina Spade, a death activist and the owner of Recompose, another NOR facility located near Seattle.\u00a0 Spade was one of the people who strongly advocated for the passage of SB 5001.\nThere\u2019s currently one other NOR facility in Washington State: Herland Forrest in Wahkiacus.\u00a0 Currently two other states, Colorado and Oregon have legalized NOR.\u00a0\u00a0\nNOR\u2019s future isn\u2019t known.\u00a0 It\u2019s new and still relatively rare. Do enough people want to be composted to have it be a viable business model? Each of these companies have different approaches to their process.\u00a0\u00a0\nReturn Home\u2019s model relies on scale.\u00a0 They wouldn\u2019t disclose the exact cost of building their facility, or how many simultaneous descendants they\u2019d need in their facility to be profitable.\u00a0 As of publishing, they charge $4,950 for their process and they have 15 of their 74 slots occupied.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd in some ways, the full ecological benefits for Return Home\u2019s process also rely on scale.\u00a0 In a follow up email, CEO Micah Truman stated that \u201cWe calculate our inputs as follows. Our electricity bill each month is about $1,700, and is sufficient to Terramate 74 bodies. This comes to $22 per body. In current gas terms ($5 a gallon at present) that is roughly 4 gallons of gas, which is about 1/8 the amount of gas used for cremation. The number is actually quite a bit better than that, as our electricity bill also powers our entire facility, not just the Terramation equipment.\u201d\nWhen asked about the relative emptiness of the facility, Katey Houston (Return Home\u2019s Services Manager) said, \u201cThe funeral industry is so slow to change. When cremation became a thing, it took sixty years to become mainstream.\u00a0 The fact that we\u2019ve served just over thirty families now in four months, is quite amazing.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve continued to grow month-over-month, and that\u2019s all I can ask for.\u201d\nThank you Hannah Suzanna for help with research for this episode.\u00a0\nHere Be Monsters is an independent, listener supported podcast.\u00a0 Consider supporting the show on Patreon.\u00a0\nProducer: Jeff Emtman\nMusic: The Black Spot and Serocell\n\nSponsor: Sleep With Me Podcast\nSleep With Me is a podcast that helps you fall asleep.\u00a0 Host Drew Ackerman tells tangential stories, reads old catalogs, makes metaphors about washing machines, and does other calming things all in pursuit of slowing your mind down and letting you drift off to sleep more peacefully.\u00a0 Subscribe to Sleep With Me on any podcast app.",

Sometimes this means that Amanda helps dying people and their families sort out their end-of-life paperwork and advanced care directives; Sometimes she helps dying people plan their own memorials. And sometimes she sits with people as they die. She says the tasks she performs are different for every person, but that her goal is always the same: to advocate for the wishes of the dying.\n\n\nAmanda says that, in her experience, death is often harder for the loved ones to accept than it is for the person who is dying. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like, in Western culture, it\u2019s not OK to die\u2026 Like we guilt the dying person into trying to keep them here longer, with medicine and medical procedures because we, the survivors, are not capable of letting go of that person.\u201d Because of this, Amanda recommends that people grieve by holding and touching the bodies of their loved ones after they die. She believes that talking about death openly will help people be less afraid.\n\n\nProducer: Bethany Denton\nEditor: Jeff Emtman\nMusic: The Black Spot",

He has trouble remembering her. Soon after her death, Colby and his siblings wound up at a house in Hope, BC where he met Santo, a childhood friend of his mom\u2019s. Colby remembers that Santo\u2019s voice to be soft and extremely calm.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Santo told Colby that he had a beautiful, green aura, a glow that surrounded his body. Back when his mother was alive, Santo had been able to see her aura too, the same green, but with a deep purply violet mixed in.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">That afternoon, Santo and Colby sat in a living room with their eyes closed. Santo led him in a visualization exercise where they breathed slowly together until a door emerged in their minds\u2019 eye. They opened the door and let light shine down. And when Colby opened his eyes, he could see auras floating around too.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Colby only saw Santo that one day, but it made an impression. In middle school and high school, Colby would sometimes stare to see the moving shapes of light around people. Eventually the ability faded.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But even today, Colby still sees clouds of green and purple before he falls asleep. He says it makes him feel connected to his mom, like she\u2019s watching over him.

            "contentSnippet": "Colby Richardson\u2019s mom got leukemia when he was young. He has trouble remembering her. Soon after her death, Colby and his siblings wound up at a house in Hope, BC where he met Santo, a childhood friend of his mom\u2019s. Colby remembers that Santo\u2019s voice to be soft and extremely calm.\u00a0\n\n\nSanto told Colby that he had a beautiful, green aura, a glow that surrounded his body. Back when his mother was alive, Santo had been able to see her aura too, the same green, but with a deep purply violet mixed in.\u00a0\n\n\nThat afternoon, Santo and Colby sat in a living room with their eyes closed. Santo led him in a visualization exercise where they breathed slowly together until a door emerged in their minds\u2019 eye. They opened the door and let light shine down. And when Colby opened his eyes, he could see auras floating around too.\u00a0\n\n\nColby only saw Santo that one day, but it made an impression. In middle school and high school, Colby would sometimes stare to see the moving shapes of light around people. Eventually the ability faded.\u00a0\n\n\nBut even today, Colby still sees clouds of green and purple before he falls asleep. He says it makes him feel connected to his mom, like she\u2019s watching over him. But he also worries that he was tricked into believing in magic while he was in a susceptible state, grieving the death of his mother.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, these days, Colby is uncertain about how to reflect on that afternoon in 2003. In the intervening years, he\u2019s thought about getting in touch with Santo, but never found the right time.\u00a0 Just recently, he finally reached out. He found that Santo\u2019s health has degraded, and he may have missed his chance to get clarity about his experience with auras.\u00a0\n\n\nProducer: Jeff Emtman\nEditor: Bethany Denton\nMusic: The Black Spot",

And those with failing kidneys have generally bad health outcomes, with many dying on the waitlist for an organ they never receive.&nbsp; There\u2019s currently <a href=\"https://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/factsheets/Organ-Donation-and-Transplantation-Stats\">about 100,000 people</a> in the country on the kidney donation waitlist.&nbsp;

Written for President Richard Nixon by Bill Safire, the speech elegizes astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong of Apollo 11, who\u2019d become stuck on the moon, and were left to die there.&nbsp; In reality, Buzz and Neil made it home safely, but this contingency speech was written anyways, just in case.&nbsp; Sometimes it\u2019s called <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/files/presidential-libraries/events/centennials/nixon/images/exhibit/rn100-6-1-2.pdf\"><em>The Safire Memo</em></a> and is sometimes called <em>In Event of Moon Disaster.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The latter title share its name with an installation that\u2019s (as of publish date) <a href=\"https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/29cebac4-4364-49d6-bf7a-479d16c04c02/in-event-of-moon-disaster\">on display for the first time at IDFA</a> in the Netherlands.&nbsp; This project by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/franpanetta\">Francesca Panetta</a> and <a href=\"https://halseyburgund.com/\">Halsey Burgund</a> explores an alternate past where Aldrin and Armstrong don\u2019t make it home from the moon.&nbsp; The film portion of the installation heavily features a reading of <em>The Safire Memo</em> by a computer generated version of President Nixon sitting in the Oval Office, reading from notes, making all the familiar facial expressions, sharing the same vocal tics, presidential timbre, and some of the Nixonian je ne sais quoi that makes the fake nearly believable.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But it\u2019s not Nixon.&nbsp; And it\u2019s not entirely accurate to say it\u2019s an actor.&nbsp; It\u2019s a kind of mix of the two, a synthetic Nixon generated by a booming form of artificial intelligence called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513696/deep-learning/\">deep learning</a>\u201d which creates mathematical models of complex systems, like speech.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923902/\">Lewis Wheeler</a>&nbsp; (the actor tasked with providing the voice of Nixon) did not have to imitate Nixon\u2019s voice, only provide a proper pacing an intonation.&nbsp; From there, the artists hired several companies (including <a href=\"https://www.respeecher.com/\">Re-Speecher</a> and <a href=\"https://vocalid.ai/\">Vocal ID</a>) trained a computer model to translate Lewis\u2019s voice into Nixon\u2019s.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This kind of deep-learned fakery (called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.creativebloq.com/features/deepfake-examples\">deepfakes</a>\u201d) currently usually falls somewhere in the uncanny valley\u2014the tech is good enough to get create a strong impersonation of a voice, but one that sounds still a bit mechanical, or metallic.&nbsp;

            "contentSnippet": "There\u2019s a beautifully written speech that was never delivered. Written for President Richard Nixon by Bill Safire, the speech elegizes astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong of Apollo 11, who\u2019d become stuck on the moon, and were left to die there.\u00a0 In reality, Buzz and Neil made it home safely, but this contingency speech was written anyways, just in case.\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s called The Safire Memo and is sometimes called In Event of Moon Disaster.\n\n\nThe latter title share its name with an installation that\u2019s (as of publish date) on display for the first time at IDFA in the Netherlands.\u00a0 This project by Francesca Panetta and Halsey Burgund explores an alternate past where Aldrin and Armstrong don\u2019t make it home from the moon.\u00a0 The film portion of the installation heavily features a reading of The Safire Memo by a computer generated version of President Nixon sitting in the Oval Office, reading from notes, making all the familiar facial expressions, sharing the same vocal tics, presidential timbre, and some of the Nixonian je ne sais quoi that makes the fake nearly believable.\u00a0\n\n\nBut it\u2019s not Nixon.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not entirely accurate to say it\u2019s an actor.\u00a0 It\u2019s a kind of mix of the two, a synthetic Nixon generated by a booming form of artificial intelligence called \u201cdeep learning\u201d which creates mathematical models of complex systems, like speech.\u00a0 Lewis Wheeler\u00a0 (the actor tasked with providing the voice of Nixon) did not have to imitate Nixon\u2019s voice, only provide a proper pacing an intonation.\u00a0 From there, the artists hired several companies (including Re-Speecher and Vocal ID) trained a computer model to translate Lewis\u2019s voice into Nixon\u2019s.\n\n\nThis kind of deep-learned fakery (called \u201cdeepfakes\u201d) currently usually falls somewhere in the uncanny valley\u2014the tech is good enough to get create a strong impersonation of a voice, but one that sounds still a bit mechanical, or metallic.\u00a0 This won\u2019t be the case for long though, as more and more convincing deepfake voices emerge with each generation of new code.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnd on the visual front, current video deepfakes are often so good as often pass the gut check of credibility.\u00a0 This may have been most famously demonstrated in a Buzzfeed article where comedian Jordan Peele impersonates President Obama\u2019s voice and a video deepfake moves his face along with the spoken words.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWith the 2020 presidential elections looming, it seems almost inevitable that deepfakes will enter the media fray that\u2019s meant to discredit political enemies, creating scandals that never happened.\u00a0 And outside of politics, deepfake pornographers take up the task of swapping pornographic actresses\u2019 faces with those of celebrities or the faces of female journalists they seek to discredit.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOn this episode of Here Be Monsters, Francesca and Halsey tell producer Jeff Emtman that deepfakes aren\u2019t going to rupture society.\u00a0 We\u2019ve dealt with this before, whether it\u2019s darkroom manipulations or photoshop, societies eventually learn how to detect deception.\u00a0 But the adjustment period can be rough, and they hope that In Event of Moon Disaster will help educate media consumers on the danger of taking media at face value, regardless of whether it\u2019s deepfakes or just old-fashioned photo mis-captioning.\n\n\nAlso on this episode, Ahnjili Zhuparris explains how computers learn to speak, and we listen to some audio examples of how computer voices can fail, using examples from the paper Location-Relative Attention Mechanisms For Robust Long-Form Speech Synthesis.\u00a0 Also heard: a presidential\u00a0 parody deepfake from user Stable Voices on Youtube.\u00a0\n\n\nProducer: Jeff Emtman\nEditor: Bethany Denton\nMusic: The Black Spot",

It was a pair of bent metal rods, each shaped into long \u2018L\u2019. Nothing special, not imparted with any kind of magic, just metal rods. Colloquially, these rods are called \u201cwitching rods\u201d or \u201cdowsing rods\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">HBM producer Jeff Emtman (child of Rick and Kathy) remembers a scene that took place the night of that gifting: each family member taking turns holding the rods, testing who had the gift of water witching. Each person held the rods by their short end with the long ends waving around in front of them. Gripped loosely enough, the rods spin freely, seemingly with a life of their own.&nbsp; And believers say that when the rods cross, that\u2019s where there\u2019s water underground. That is...if a true witch is holding the rods.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Who\u2019s a water witch? Well it depends who you ask. Some say that the gift is rare, some say that it\u2019s in nearly all of us. It\u2019s a folk belief, one not canonized in any central text and one not well supported by science. However, it persists (strongly in some places) as a regular thing for people to do when they need a well dug\u2014cited as a way to gather a second opinion before paying a well driller to dig on their property.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And this desire for a second opinion seems quite understandable. Wells in the <a href=\"http://www.sevenwondersofwashingtonstate.com/the-palouse.html\">Palouse Region</a> of Eastern Washington State (where Jeff grew up) often require digging hundreds of feet to find water of sufficient quality and quantity to sustain a family or a farm. These wells might cost $10,000 to $30,000 each. Further, the well drillers charge per hole dug, regardless of whether there\u2019s water down there.

            "contentSnippet": "Some time in the 90\u2019s, Kathy Emtman received a gift from her husband, Rick. It was a pair of bent metal rods, each shaped into long \u2018L\u2019. Nothing special, not imparted with any kind of magic, just metal rods. Colloquially, these rods are called \u201cwitching rods\u201d or \u201cdowsing rods\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\nHBM producer Jeff Emtman (child of Rick and Kathy) remembers a scene that took place the night of that gifting: each family member taking turns holding the rods, testing who had the gift of water witching. Each person held the rods by their short end with the long ends waving around in front of them. Gripped loosely enough, the rods spin freely, seemingly with a life of their own.\u00a0 And believers say that when the rods cross, that\u2019s where there\u2019s water underground. That is...if a true witch is holding the rods.\n\n\nWho\u2019s a water witch? Well it depends who you ask. Some say that the gift is rare, some say that it\u2019s in nearly all of us. It\u2019s a folk belief, one not canonized in any central text and one not well supported by science. However, it persists (strongly in some places) as a regular thing for people to do when they need a well dug\u2014cited as a way to gather a second opinion before paying a well driller to dig on their property.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd this desire for a second opinion seems quite understandable. Wells in the Palouse Region of Eastern Washington State (where Jeff grew up) often require digging hundreds of feet to find water of sufficient quality and quantity to sustain a family or a farm. These wells might cost $10,000 to $30,000 each. Further, the well drillers charge per hole dug, regardless of whether there\u2019s water down there. So, picking the right spot is paramount.\n\n\nWell driller Brett Uhlenkott calls water witching a \u201cfarce\u201d, preferring to drill based on his understanding of the landscape, his readings of the geologic maps and his knowledge of nearby successful wells. But he\u2019s had clients who request he drill in a spot a witch found. And if that\u2019s what his client wants, then that\u2019s where he drills.\u00a0\n\n\nBrett says there\u2019s no mechanism for any information to travel the great distance between a witcher\u2019s rods and a tiny vein of groundwater that runs hundreds of feet below the surface. Despite this, Brett keeps a pair of rods himself, saying that it might work for things closer to the surface. He cites an instance where he was able to locate a pipe or cable located several feet underground using the rods.\u00a0 Brett thinks it might have something to do with minerals, or that it might just be something that we imagine in our heads.\n\n\nThe mechanism most often cited for the seemingly organic movements of a witcher\u2019s rods is so-called ideomotor movement, which is the same thing that makes Ouija boards work.\u00a0 Simply put, these motions are the result of unconscious movements we make when we feel something should work.\u00a0 With witching, these motions get amplified by the long rods, resulting in movement that seems to emerge from nothing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAttempts to prove the validity of witching exist. Proponents cite a study by Hans-Dieter Betz that claimed incredible success rate in witched wells in countries with dry climates.\u00a0 This paper received criticism for its unusual methodology.\u00a0 Betz published another paper on water witching in a controlled environment, where he found a select few people who he claimed could reliably witch water, however that study also received criticism for its method of data analysis.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBack in the 90\u2019s.\u00a0 Jeff held the rods, and he was able to find the pipes in the house, the sprinkler lines in the yard.\u00a0 The rods moved convincingly, crossing where they were supposed to, uncrossing where they weren\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this episode of Here Be Monsters, Jeff revisits his hometown, debates the merits of black-box thinking with his parents (Rick and Kathy Emtman), talks with his grandma (Peggy Emtman) about the desire to have a talent she can\u2019t have, interviews three farmers and a former farmhand (Ian Clark, Asa Clark, Ron Libbey and Owen Prout) about their experiences with witching, and asks his parents\u2019 pastor (Wes Howell of Trinity Lutheran Church) to explain the origin of the term \u201chocus pocus\u201d.\n\n\nOthers who helped with this episode include Lindsay Myron, Nick Long-Rinehart, Brandon Libbey, Mary Clark, Joe Hein, and Kirsten O\u2019Brien.\u00a0\n\n\nProducer: Jeff Emtman\nEditor: Bethany Denton\nMusic: The Black Spot",

                "summary": "Carlo Nakar spent more than twenty years in the United States before he was called by God to return to the the Philippines. It happened during one of his first classes of grad school at the Seattle School of Theology and Psychology. \u00a0He looked into the rafters and asked, \u201cLord, what would be the hardest thing that you could ever ask me to do?\u201d He received a verbal answer: \u201cYou should work with sexually trafficked girls in the Philippines.\u201d\n\nContent Note: Human trafficking, sexual abuse, and language.\n\nAt that time, Carlo was in grad school to find himself after a long stint working at a facility for abused and neglected kids. \u00a0But he had stayed there too long and effectively burnt out from the secondary trauma of working with children who were sexually aggressive. \u00a0He felt unfit to become a therapist. \n\nSo it came as a surprise when God called him to work with sexually trafficked girls in the Philippines: \u201cBut I was called to do this. I have to show up.\u201d\n\nSince receiving the call from God, Carlo accepted an internship at Samaritana in Quezon City, near his hometown of Manila, where human trafficking is prevalent. There he works with women who have been trafficked or worked as prostitutes. In this episode, Carlo tells the story of the first time he did street outreach in Quezon City on behalf of the organization. \n\nSince recording his audio diaries, Carlo traveled to India to attend a conference hosted by the International Christian Alliance on Prostitution. He attended a presentation on OSEC (online sexual exploitation of children) and for a second time he felt called by God. He said he felt a sense of certainty that this is the work that he is uniquely prepared to do. After graduation, he intends to work as a therapist for children who have been sexually exploited online.\n\nCarlo\u2019s been on HBM before, in one of our very first episodes. Listen to HBM008: Chuck Gets Circumcised. \n\nProducer: Bethany DentonEditor: Bethany DentonMusic: The Black Spot | | | Circling Lights"

In this shape, Max suspends particles in a cage of other particles. &nbsp;This shouldn\u2019t be possible, based on <a href=\"https://simion.com/info/earnshaws_theorem.html\">Earnshaw\u2019s Theorem</a>, which in layman's terms, means that it\u2019s really hard to keep the particle in the middle from squirting out the sides. &nbsp;But Max\u2019s shape, along with a constantly changing voltage, suspends things in a Goldilocks-type way.  He calls this \u201cstably unstable\u201d. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">His first proof of concept worked. &nbsp;Now he\u2019s on his second.  He says he\u2019s almost ready to do a major fusion test, where he\u2019ll drag his 300 pound reactor out to rural Maine, &nbsp;bury it in the ground and stand a safe distance away (to avoid the neutron radiation).  And if it works, he\u2019ll be on to solving the next problem, which is how to actually harvest the power it generates. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Max doesn\u2019t think the solution is a single step away. &nbsp;There are still many hurdles to overcome before fusion replaces the dirty and inefficient power we use today. &nbsp;And maybe those hurdles are too many, maybe it\u2019s a <a href=\"https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list/the-fool-meaning-major-arcana-tarot-card-meanings\">fool\u2019s</a> errand. &nbsp;But he\u2019s hopeful that fusion can save at least part of the world. &nbsp;\ufeff</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A couple more links for you: </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"http://ifsa.my/articles/the-unknown-unknowns-platos-allegory-of-the-cave\">Socrates, Plato\u2019s cave and the \u201cknown unknowns\u201d</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"http://dieoff.org/page80.htm\">Fluctuations in the Reindeer Population on St. Matthew\u2019s Island</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2009/11/11/120129676/the-red-book-a-window-into-jungs-dreams\">Carl Jung\u2019s Red Book</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Producer:</strong> <a href=\"http://jeffemtman.com/\">Jeff Emtman</a><br><strong>Editor:</strong> <a href=\"http://jeffemtman.com/\">Jeff Emtman</a><br><strong>Music:</strong> <a href=\"https://theblackspot.bandcamp.com/\">The Black Spot</a>, <a href=\"https://music.unclassedmedia.com/\">Serocell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.luckydragons.org/\">Lucky Dragons</a>\ufeff</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong><em>Correction: </em></strong><em>In the episode, we misstate the natural abundance of Deuterium.  </em><a href=\"http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Deuterium\"><em>The correct abundance is .015%</em></a><em>.

The court ruled unanimously that this ordinance was unconstitutional, citing its attempt to restrict religious practice. \n\nProducer: Jeff EmtmanEditor: Jeff EmtmanMusic: Circling Lights, The Black Spot, Serocell\n\n*Today, Santeria and Palo are practiced across much of the Caribbean, especially Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic. Other areas of Caribbean diaspora like Florida, New York and New Jersey also have significant populations of believers. However, solid numbers of followers are hard to estimate due to the religion\u2019s decentralization, which also contributes to the varying beliefs across adherents of different origins. If you practice or used to practice Santeria/Palo/Ifa, we\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.

                "summary": "Not all migratory bats migrate. \u00a0We don\u2019t know why some choose to stay behind at their summer roosts. \u00a0But according to the University of Washington\u2019s Sharlene Santana, the bats that stay tend to die. \u00a0\n\nContent Note: Fleeting language\n\nIn this episode, HBM host Jeff Emtman attempts to make a metaphor about bats and humans. \u00a0Perhaps it\u2019s anthropomorphic, perhaps it\u2019s unnecessarily poetic, or perhaps it\u2019s a fair one. \u00a0\n\nJeff leaves his home in Seattle to move cross-country to Boston. \u00a0Along the way he takes a five day layover in Colorado to meet up with an old friend (Helen Katich) and her girlfriend (Laura Goldhamer). \u00a0The three drive from Denver to the San Luis Valley of Central Colorado. \u00a0They visit Valley View Hot Springs and walk to the mouth of an abandoned iron mine 10,000 feet above sea level called \u201cThe Glory Hole.\u201d \u00a0\n\nThe Glory Hole houses an estimated 250,000 Mexican free-tailed bats each summer. \u00a0These bats migrate in from Central and South America to eat bugs and raise their pups. \u00a0They fly together at dusk in gatherings visually similar to the murmurations of starlings. \u00a0\u00a0This bat species, also known as the Brazilian free-tailed bat, is extremely social, and perhaps nature\u2019s most gregarious mammal species. \u00a0\n\nDespite this, their social and hunting calls are completely inaudible to humans. \u00a0They produce ultrasounds, sounds too high pitched for human ears. But some audio equipment (see below) can still record these sounds, then computer algorithms can pitch them down into human-audible sounds. \u00a0\n\nOne evening, Jeff and Helen and Laura hike to the mouth of the mine. \u00a0At this vantage point, they watch some of the bats flying out and Jeff manages to record some of their loud, ultrasonic vocalizations, before the storm forces them back downhill. \u00a0The next day, Jeff flies to his new home in Boston.\n\nJeff recorded the bat calls in this episode with a Tascam DR100MK3 at 192kHZ sample rate and an Echo Meter Touch 2 Pro at sample rates of 256kHZ and 384kHZ. \u00a0The calls were recorded at frequencies of approximately 21kHZ to 36kHZ and time/pitch-shifted with Elastique 3.2.3 Pro.\n\nProducer: Jeff EmtmanEditor: Bethany DentonMusic: The Black Spot and Laura Goldhamer"

Additional editing help from Nick White at KCRW.\n\nMusic: \u00a0The Black Spot, Flowers\n\nHello NYC! \u00a0Jeff and Bethany are speaking at The Unplugged Soul at Columbia University\u2019s Heyman Center on April 14th and 15th. \u00a0It\u2019s free. \u00a0Register here."

                "summary": "Before Doog could walk, his family gave him a guitar to hold and encouraged him to play music.\u00a0By the time he was twelve, he'd started writing songs as a way to make sense of the confusing world around him.\u00a0Back then he was just Eric Alexander, the friendly weird kid who dressed like a punky cowboy.\u00a0\u00a0In college a fellow musician asked Eric what his middle name was. \"Douglas,\" Eric replied. \"Douglas? Doug, Doug... Doog... I'm going to call you Doog.\" The name stuck, and eventually Eric created his raspy, crass musical persona: Sir Deja Doog.\n\nNote: Explicit Content\n\nIn his early twenties, Doog started hearing voices, seeing and feeling things that weren't there. He worried that he was losing his mind and avoided telling his friends what was happening. For years he was in and out of the emergency room and psych ward. He sought treatment and was medicated on and off for depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nBut his problems persisted. In 2012, Doog became homeless and started hitchhiking up and down the West Coast. All the while he experienced terrifying hallucinations and suicidal thoughts. Throughout this period he continued to make music. With little more than a broken iPhone and an old guitar, Doog recorded hours of harsh, distorted music. Later he edited these recordings into a video he called Bad Dharma. (below).\n\nDoog's symptoms worsened. By 2013 he started having partial seizures. One night he had a vision that he was being abducted by ancient aliens, so old he could see through their papery skin. One of the aliens poked Doog behind his left ear.\n\nA few weeks later Doog was in the hospital again, feeling suicidal. This time the doctors gave Doog an MRI. When they scanned his brain, they found a small, calcified tumor called a glioma. The tumor was in the left hemisphere of his brain -- just inches from where the alien poked him in his vision. Doctors told Doog that he needed brain surgery immediately or he would soon die.\n\nFaced with the prospect of an early death, he ignored the doctors\u2019 orders fearing the surgery would affect his musical creativity. Instead, Doog decided to focus his energy on creating his masterpiece: Sir Deja Doog's Love Coffin.\n\nFor months, Doog obsessed over Love Coffin. He wrote and recorded day and night through partial and full seizures and debilitating headaches. It was only once his album was finished and his symptoms became unbearable that he agreed to surgery. Doctors removed the tumor and some surrounding parts of his brain.\n\nToday, Doog continues to recover, and he's slowly re-learning how to be independent as his brain heals. Seventeen months after surgery Doog was in remission, but soon after that doctors found gliosis in his brain\u2014scar tissue that forms after severe brain trauma. Doctors continue to monitor him for additional cancers. It is possible that Doog will need chemotherapy.\n\nDoog performed for the first time after his cancer diagnosis on Halloween of 2015 (picture above). Since then, he's released an EP called The Return of Sir Deja Doog."

About $25, before shipping. \u00a0At least, that's the case if you want a high-quality inbred lab mouse, like the C57BL/6J\u00a0(in the biz, they just call them \"black mice\").\u00a0\n\nIn this episode of Here Be Monsters, Jeff Emtman joins \"The Scientist,\" an unnamed cancer researcher, for an after-hours trip to his lab, where they visit the hundreds of lab mice that he tends to. \u00a0The Scientist's job is to inject his mice with cancer cells, then attempt to cure them using experimental treatments. \u00a0After the cancers become too large, he kills the mice.\u00a0\n\nThe Scientist says that he is not a satanist,\u00a0despite the satanic art that covers much of his body. \u00a0 Instead, he considers himself a utilitarian, someone who believes that sacrifices must be made to promote the most good for the most beings (human or otherwise). \u00a0And \"sacrifice\" is actually the technical term he and others use for killing the mice. \u00a0The Scientist admits that it is a euphemistic word, but defends it because \"from their sacrifice, you gain knowledge.\"\n\nIn his lab, the death comes via carbon dioxide, which is often thought to be the most painless option (though it has critics). \u00a0Other labs use cervical dislocation--though generally there's a requirement that the animal must be unconscious first. \u00a0\n\nAfter the lab, Jeff and The Scientist sit out on a porch drinking beer, discussing the path to becoming a scientist, The Scientist's admiration of Neil Degrasse Tyson, and the beautiful French animated film, Fantastic Planet.\n\nMusic:\u00a0Lucky Dragons,\u00a0The Black Spot,\u00a0Flowers"

When is it safer to hide?\n\nThis episode was produced by Marlo Mack. \u00a0Jeff Emtman edited it with help from Bethany Denton and Nick White.\u00a0 \n\nMusic: \u00a0The Black Spot\u00a0\n\nResources for trans children and their parents:\u00a0Trans Youth Family Allies\u00a0\u00a0 - for families of trans youthThe Trevor Project\u00a0- specifically crisis and suicide preventionYouthResource\u00a0- specifically for trans/lgbt youthHuman Rights Campaign - list of resources for trans youth"

Use discretion before you use anything else in your term paper.\n\nMusic from: Flowerpetal Downpour ||| Lucky Dragons ||| Nym ||| Swamp Dog\n\nHey! Review HBM on iTunes! And like us on Facebook!"
