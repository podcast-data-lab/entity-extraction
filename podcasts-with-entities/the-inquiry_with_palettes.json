                "summary": "Europe\u2019s migration crisis began back in 2015, with the arrival of over a million refugees, the majority from the war in Syria.   Many thousands more from different countries have since sought refuge on European shores for one reason or another, whilst the tightening of external borders and asylum laws have proved ineffective in stopping the boats.\n\nThere have been years of disagreements over migration amongst the member states of the European Union, which have caused damage to the bloc\u2019s unity. In recent months, however, it looked like some progress had been made towards a fairer and more uniform migration system, but a proposal to relocate people to different parts of Europe was met with opposition.\n\nAs the flow of people into frontline countries like Italy, Greece and Spain looks set to continue in the future, it appears that collective action from the member states, looks further away.\n\nThis week on The Inquiry we\u2019re asking \u2018Can Europe solve its migrant crisis?\u2019\n\nContributors:\n\nHanne Beirens, Director, Migration Policy Institute Europe, Brussels\n\nCathryn Costello, Full Professor of Global Refugee and Migration Law, UCD Sutherland School of Law, University College Dublin, Ireland\n\nCharles Kenny, Senior Fellow, Centre for Global Development, Washington DC.

However there are also other important factors driving this, namely gun deaths and drug deaths as a result of opioid overdoses.  And another major contributor to lower life expectancy in the States is inequality in the US healthcare system.\n \nIn this edition of The Inquiry Tanya Beckett explores why US life expectancy is falling.\nShe hears from Jeremy Ney an adjunct professor at Presidio Graduate School in San Francisco and author of American Inequality,  a data project that highlights US inequality and regional divides. \nDr. Mark Rosenberg  helped set up the Centre for Disease Control\u2019s National Centre for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) and is a key proponent of research that examines how to reduce gun violence.  He explains how gun deaths among young people have a big influence on the average life expectancy numbers.\nDr. Judith Feinberg, is a professor at West Virginia University School of Medicine - her experience of working with communities with high levels of opioid problems makes her an authority on the extent to which drug overdose deaths impact average life expectancy.\nEllen Marra is a  professor of health economics at Harvard University - she says that diseases such as cancer and cardio deaths are big factors in lower life expectancy, compared with the number of gun and opioid deaths.\n\n\nCREDITS\nPresenter Tanya Beckett\nProducer Phil Reevell. \nResearcher Bisi Adebayo\nEditor Tom Bigwood\n\nImage: USA Birthday Cake, Credit: Getty Images",

Do sightings and hearsay provide enough scientific data to answer a question that has been asked by humans for thousands of years \u2013 are we alone in the universe? \n\nContributors: \nGreg Eghigian is professor of history and bioethics at Penn State University in the US.\nLeslie Kean is an investigative reporter.\nAdam Frank is Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Rochester, and author of The Little Book of Aliens. \nDr Chelsea Haramia is a member of the UK SETI Research Network Post-detection Hub.\n\nPresented by Charmaine Cozier \nProduced by Louise Clarke \nResearched by Matt Toulson and Bisi Adebayo \nEditor Tom Bigwood \nMixed by Kelly Young\n\n(UFO crash site sign in Roswell, New Mexico USA / Getty Images)"

The latter, known officially as the Parental Rights In Education Act\u2019,  denounced by critics as \u2018Don\u2019t Say Gay\u2019, has led to an ongoing legal battle with Disney over their criticism of the Act. \n\nRon DeSantis claims that his \u2018Florida Blueprint\u2019 can act as a guide for Federal Policies.  But before that, he\u2019s got an uphill battle to unseat his former political mentor Donald Trump. The former President is currently leading the Republican field in the polls and he\u2019s not wasted any time in attacking Ron DeSantis on a number of fronts, from insults and nicknames, to criticising some of his policies. \n\nThis week on the Inquiry we\u2019re asking \u2018Can Ron DeSantis win the White House?\u2019\n\nContributors: \nAubrey Jewett, Professor of Political Science at the University of Central Florida, Orlando.\nMatt Terrill, Public Affairs, Firehouse Strategies, former Chief of Staff to the Marco Rubio for President Campaign. \nRon Christie, Former Special Assistant to President George W.

A few years later, he became a superstar, and she licenced one of her photos to Vanity Fair to be used as a reference picture for an illustration.\n\nThat portrait, known as \u201cPurple Prince\u201d was painted by Andy Warhol.\n\nBut what Lynn Goldsmith didn\u2019t know, and nor did anyone else, was that Warhol made multiple portraits from her photograph.

They have been met by a fierce and brutal response.\n\nAt least 60 Peruvians have lost their lives in the protests, and a further 1000 or more have suffered injury. Still the protests continue. Can Peru sort out its political problems? \n\nPresenter: Charmaine Cozier \nProducer: Christopher Blake\nResearcher: John Cossee\nEditor: Tara McDermott\nProduction Co-ordinator: Brenda Brown\n\nImage: Peru's President Pedro Castillo after his swearing-in ceremony in Lima, Peru, 28 July 2021.

For the first time in a long time, the Incumbent president will not be contesting the elections \u2013 having already served the maximum allowed two terms.\n\nSince 2016, the country has spiralled down as inflation has hit over 20% and unemployment rides at around 30% overall, and 60% for the young. Banditry and kidnappings have become lucrative methods of making a living in the country and a pervading sense that this could be now or never for Nigerians hangs ominously.\n\nThree candidates have emerged as the front runners for the elections. The stalwarts Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressive Congress, or APC, and Atiku Abubakar, of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, or DPD, are familiar faces from familiar parties. Power has been shared between the two parties since 1999.\n\nPeter Obi is the outsider who has taken a dramatic lead over recent weeks in the polls. He represents the Labour Party who have never held power and is offering to run the country in a different manner to what the country has been used to thus far.\n\nForeshadowing the entire event is the expectation that Nigeria is expected to reach a population of around 400 million by 2050, making it the fourth largest country in terms of population by this date. That is an increase of around 60-80% of the current population estimates.

                "summary": "The world is becoming increasingly dependent on advanced microchips to power its high-end technology, However, they are made by just one company in Taiwan, TSMC, meaning the rest of the world is largely reliant on the country to produce its microchips. This is no accident and is in fact by Taiwanese design. \nOver three decades ago Taiwan decided to focus its resources on becoming the most advanced producer of microchips. Not only has this been of great profit for Taiwan\u2019s economy its helped with security too \u2013 offering the country protection from its neighbour China by creating what\u2019s been described as the \u2018Silicon shield\u2019, in other words, the US is largely dependent on Taiwan to sustain its high-end tech. \nGiven both the USA\u2019s and EU\u2019s recent announcements that they are now heavily investing in and subsidising their own microchip industries, the question becomes is this still sustainable?\n\nPresenter: Charmaine Cozier \nProducer: Christopher Blake and Ravi Naik\nEditor: Tara McDermott"

Could traditional sea wall defences hold back the waters, or are there more effective solutions?

                "summary": "When we shop online, we don\u2019t often think about what goes on behind the scenes. Clicking \u201cpay now\u201d, sets in motion a slick, computer-controlled chain of events, that ends with a parcel arriving at your home. \n\nThese online shopping logistics are run by Artificial Intelligence, and there are plans for these systems to move from the warehouse to the wider workplace.   \n\n\u201cDigital Management\u201d systems in development are able to autonomously hire people and oversee their work on a project from beginning to end. They also have the ability to manage much larger groups of workers than their human counterparts. \n\nBut can a software boss really understand its human employees? Are managers obsolete? And are some of these systems already here?  \n\nThis week on the Inquiry, we ask: will computers put managers out of work? \n\nPresented by David Baker \nProduced by Jim Frank \nEditor: Richard Vadon \nTechnical producer: Neil Churchill \nBroadcast Coordinator: Jacqui Johnson\n\n\n(Image: Artificial intelligence is showing the path: exdez/Getty)"

                "summary": "The Covid-19 pandemic forced countries all over the world to close entire industries and force the majority of people to stay in their own homes where possible, only leaving for the bare essentials. \n\nFollowing the arrival of a vaccine economies began to open back up, however, restarting the behemoth-like supply chains was not as simple as first hoped and issues began to occur resulting in empty shelves and price-gouging on certain products. Experts believed it was all par for the course and was merely a transitory period whilst global supply chains regained their flow. Then Russia invaded Ukraine. Then China locked down Shanghai, the world's largest shipping port. Tanya Beckett takes a closer look at how these two developments have changed the outlook on global inflation.\n \nProducer: Christopher Blake\nEditor: Richard Vadon\n\nImage: Shoppers at a market in Istanbul (Credit: Diego Cupolo/NurPhoto via Getty Images)"

The country\u2019s farms were going to go fully organic. \n\nHealth concerns were given as a reason, but in the background was the pandemic, loss of tourism and a lack of natural fertilizer available in the country. \n\nSri Lanka is now in the worse economic crisis they have seen in decades and the government has reversed its ban on chemical fertilizer.  \n\nThis week on The Inquiry we explore why Sri Lanka\u2019s organic farming dream failed. \n\nPresented by Charmain Cozier\nProduced by Louise Clarke-Rowbotham\nResearched by Christopher Blake\n\n(Woman picking tea on plantation in Sri Lanka.

It began in China then reached the Middle East, Europe and the United States, now Africa is bracing itself for a surge in coronavirus cases. But how will the continent, with its weaker health care systems and often poor populations cope? The picture is not the same everywhere. Some countries and some sections of society may fare better than others, but the worry is that many African countries simply don\u2019t have the tools or resources to stand up to this pandemic. Or might there be some lessons learnt from the Ebola outbreak which could help? This is a continent of young people, so demographics could work in their favour, but many of them are already compromised by HIV, malaria and other disease outbreaks.\n\nTanya Beckett speaks to the director of a hospital in rural Uganda, to the head of the Nigeria\u2019s Centre for Disease Control, to the CEO of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries and to the former President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, about their worries and preparations for Covid-19.  \n\nPresenter: Tanya Beckett\nProducer: John Murphy\n\n(An African man wearing an alternative mask in Kampala, Uganda April 2020.

It argued that having many households run by a single woman risked holding back the progress of the next generation. At the time it was very controversial, rejected by mainstream academia and described as victim blaming. \n\nMore than fifty years on, from the 'Moynihan' report we look at what modern research tells us about how children develop with married, cohabiting and single parents. Is there really a marked difference in their behaviour, cognition or emotional development?"

Indian military jets were deployed and one was shot down. As concerns over the pilot\u2019s fate grew, fears mounted that India and Pakistan might go to war over Kashmir \u2013 again.  The countries have been at war four times since partition in 1947. And Kashmir, which both countries claim in entirety but each one controls only in part, has been a key factor in the conflicts. But even when there is no war, there is no stable peace in Kashmir. Violent protests and street fighting are commonplace and daily life is made hard in numerous other ways.

                "summary": "The European Union was formed in the years after the Second World War to secure peace and promote economic progress. It aimed to achieve that by ensuring that countries worked together.  But that optimistic vision has now been shaken. There is mounting anxiety about whether the EU can hold together. Some are even saying that the EU is facing an existential crisis. That\u2019s because the elections in May are likely to bring in another wave of populist politicians promoting nationalist agendas. The Inquiry will detail the fissures that have been exposed in recent years. One cause has been migration from countries outside the EU and the pressures caused by free movement within its borders.  The severe economic downturn has threatened unity too. Kavita Puri explores whether there are moments in the European Union\u2019s history when, had different decisions been made, the EU might have hung together better.  \n\nPresenter:  Kavita Puri  \nProducer: Rosamund Jones\n\nImage: A shredded European Union flag flutters in the wind.

                "summary": "The tech giant has had a meteoric rise over the last ten years. It has overtaken Apple in the global smartphone market, and its equipment is in telecommunications systems in 170 countries worldwide. But Huawei now finds itself at the centre of a global scandal. \n\nIts chief financial officer - the daughter of the company\u2019s founder - is under house arrest in Canada, accused of selling telecom equipment to Iran in contravention of US sanctions. \n\nA week later, a US court charged the whole company with bank fraud, obstruction of justice and theft of technology from rival T-Mobile.\n\nThe company has been banned in New Zealand and Australia, and there are moves in the US to stop government employees from buying their products.\n\nCritics say if it wins the contracts for the new 5G network being created globally, it could give the Chinese government control over everything from smart phones, to cars, to pacemakers in other countries.\n\nSo why has the success story soured? This week, we ask: what\u2019s so scary about Huawei?\n\nPresenter: Kavita Puri\nProducer: Jordan Dunbar"

Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are dying due to antibiotic resistance - and this number is set to rise rapidly. If we carry on like this, scientists predict we will return to a pre-antibiotic era, where organ transplants, chemotherapy and C-sections are impossible. \n\nWe have come a long way since 1928, when the famous chance discovery of penicillin led to a golden age in which antibiotics were seen as wonder drugs, heralding in an age of huge medical advances and increased human life spans. But by the 1990s we were running out of new antibiotics and infections were again a killer. How did this happen?\n\nOur expert witnesses are medic and historian, Dr Eric Sidebottom, Dr Scott Podolsky of Harvard Medical School, journalist Maryn McKenna and infectious disease specialist Brad Spellberg.\n\n(Photo: A depiction EHEC bacteria.

                "summary": "Most countries in the world have signed up to the idea that no child should work at all under a certain age \u2013 but is this the best approach? This week Nicolle, a 17 year old from Peru, has been part of a delegation of child labourers visiting the UN to ask them to rethink their ban on child labour. She\u2019s been working since she was 8 years old, and says not only did her family need the money she earned, but working brought her status and respect.  Some charities and experts working with child labourers agree that there are safe forms of child work. They say non-hazardous work can allow children to help their families, gain life skills, and even pay for the school uniforms and equipment they need to stay in education. But the UN and other former child labourers disagree, saying an outright ban is the only way to protect children from exploitation. We ask whether it\u2019s time to rethink the ban on child labour.\n\nContributors include: \n\nBenjamin Smith \u2013 Senior Officer for Child Labour, International Labour Organization\nJo Boyden \u2013 Professor of International Development, Oxford University\nZulema Lopez \u2013 former child labourer\nKavita Ratna - Director of Advocacy and Fundraising, Concerned for Working Children\n\nPresenter: Helena Merriman\nProducer: Beth Sagar-Fenton\n\n\nImage: Girls collecting firewood in Eritrea, 2004\nCredit: Scott Wallace/Getty Images"

Seven and a half years later that was the equivalent of over $80m. \n\nBitcoin has been exploding in value throughout 2017 as more and more people buy into the idea of a digital currency. Traditional financial institutions have even begun to get involved. But far from a mainstream investment, Bitcoin started life as an idea from the radical cypherpunk movement, who wanted to use decentralised technologies as a way to disrupt governments and corporations.\n\nIn this edition of The Inquiry we trace the history and development of Bitcoin \u2013 and ask whether its future will stay true to its libertarian roots.\n\n\n(Image: The Digital Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
