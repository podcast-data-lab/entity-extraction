Thinking about the way we lean into self-care while also doing the things - like working, living, and decompressing from the day. And it really ties into this motivating conversation with Zuri Adele (actress + storyteller) I had a while back.\n\nAs we're looking at who we want to be in the new year, it's helpful to reflect on our experiences and the things we have accomplished in this time. What lessons have we learned and how are we using them to own our story and our identity in this world? Especially when it comes to the wellness industry, which is full of essential tools for our well-being, yet surrounded primarily by whiteness. Consider this more food for thought in this already thoughtful time we're all in.\n\nbalancedblackgirl.com/ep-77-zuri-adele \u25c9 IG: @balancedblackgirlpodcast @balancedles \u3006\n\nSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/balanced-black-girl/donations\n\nPrivacy & Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy"

This is just one of the many questions I ask Taylor around our relationship with our screens and creating an unplugged self-care practice. Taylor Morrison is an international speaker, facilitator, and the founder of Inner Workout. She's on a mission to help others beat burnout by building sustainable self-care practices. Taylor is also the host of the podcast, Inner Warmup - a show I listen to on the reg.\n\nOne of my favorite highlights from this conversation was the acknowledgment that what self-care looks for us now will look different for us five years from now - it could even look different in five weeks or five days. Building a healthy relationship with our screens is so much more than taking back our time - it's taking back our sense of self and our ability to have discernment for our lives and our needs.\n\nbalancedblackgirl.com \u25c9 IG: @balancedblackgirlpodcast @balancedles \u3006\n\nSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/balanced-black-girl/donations\n\nPrivacy & Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy"

Mindfulness is about understanding how to leverage certain tools to bring you back to a state of calmness and zen.\n\n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty about not being calm and centered all the time because we are all human. We are all living a different human experience unique to us. But how can we incorporate mindfulness into our routines as a way to guide us and bring us back to center?\u00a0\n\n\nMy guest today is Dora Kamau. Dora is a meditation and mindfulness teacher, who uses meditation as a tool to guide individuals in experiencing who they truly are. Unshaken and impenetrable by the qualms of life, Dora utilizes her own lived experience to guide in-person and online gatherings for women to connect through intentional conversations. Over the last 2 years, she has led thousands in meditation with individuals participating from all over the world and from all walks of life.\n\n\nIn November 2017, Dora founded Bliss Your Heart, a flourishing women\u2019s community-based in Vancouver, in which she\u2019s hosted workshops focused on self-care, self-love, and mental health. With a calling for compassion-centered care, Dora is also a registered psychiatric nurse that integrates holistic, trauma-informed practices for women living with substance dependence and mental illness. In 2020, she completed Sumi Touch's All Black Doula training to continue to support expecting birth folks in marginalized communities.\n\n\nHer work in the community has aligned her with brands such as Headspace, Insight Timer, NBC, lululemon, Reebok, Little Burgundy, Saje Natural Wellness, Call it Spring, and many others.\n\n\nIn this episode, we discuss:\n\n\nDora\u2019s journey into mindfulness + meditation\nHow teaching and guiding others has impacted Dora\u2019s own mindfulness practice\nKeeping yourself centered when life gets tough\nWhat we can do to help others care for themselves\nPersonal development and how to prepare yourself for growth + opportunities\n\n\nHit play to learn how to integrate mindfulness into your everyday!\u00a0\n\n\nResources:\n\n\nFollow Dora Kamau on Instagram @dora_kamau\nTo learn more about Dora and how she can help you explore mindfulness, check out www.dorakamau.ca\nTo follow Dora + listen to her meditations on Insight Timer, head over to insighttimer.com/dorakamau\nListen to Dora\u2019s meditations on Headspace, signup for free at www.headspace.com\n\n\n\n\nSponsors:\n\n\nAthletic Greens | Try Athletic Greens whole-foods sourced nutrition.

Do you remember what you were doing this time last year?\u00a0\n\n\nIf I knew what was coming, I would have spent those last weeks in February and first weeks of March differently. I would have spent that time with people who are near and dear to my heart.\u00a0\n\n\nReflecting on the past year has brought up so many feelings and emotions. Feelings of grief, and those moments of isolation and loneliness, burnout, creativity, nostalgia, and perseverance.\n\n\nThis experience has taught me to be cognizant and aware of my time. I have to be just as discerning about where, how, and with whom I spend my time with. And where, how, and with whom I spend my money with. We all have the gift of discernment, and we have all had times where we used it and were grateful.\u00a0\n\n\nA big lesson I learned on the anniversary of this week is to use my discernment. We can\u2019t predict the future, and we can\u2019t change the past, but we can lean into our relationship with spirit to guide us. We can lean into getting quiet and going within to listen to our intuition.\n\n\nJoin me for a guided journaling session, reflecting on a full year of living through a global pandemic.

I\u2019m breaking down what my morning self-care routine looks like, why it can be short and sweet (I promise you don\u2019t need to wake up at the crack of dawn for a solid morning self-care routine), and how you can customize it to make it work for you.</span></p> <p><span>Generally speaking, I break my morning routine into three categories: things that take care of my mind, body, and spirit. Depending on my season in life and what my priorities are, the amount of time I spend on each area, and what I do to support each area will vary. But I recommend you find a routine that works well for you!
