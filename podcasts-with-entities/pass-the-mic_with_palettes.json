It can feel like the whole world is telling you to shut up.\nTo these forces, Ally Henny is here to say, \"No. I am a loud Black woman, and I won't shut up.\" Ally knows what it's like to navigate racism and racialized sexism, having spent most of her life in predominantly white spaces. She's not taking it anymore, and she's calling you to join her in resisting racism by speaking the truth--no matter the cost. In this compelling book, Ally tells her own story of finding her voice, pushing back against oppression, and embracing her unique perspective as a loud Black woman. And she invites you to find your voice in a world that tries to silence you.\nIf you're tired of feeling silenced, misunderstood, and abused by society, you'll find here powerful words of liberation that will empower you to find--and use--your voice.\nPre Order the book today: I Won't Shut Up: Finding Your Voice When the World Tries to Silence You (An Unvarnished Perspective on Racism That Calls Black Women to Find Their Voice): Henny, Ally, Coke, Danielle: 9781540902658: Amazon.com: Books\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "With civil rights advocacy in his DNA, Rev. Dr. Otis Moss III built his ministry on community advancement and social justice activism. As Senior Pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, Illinois, Dr. Moss spent the last two decades practicing and preaching a Black theology that unapologetically calls attention to the problems of mass incarceration, environmental justice, and economic inequality.\u00a0\nDr. Moss is part of a new generation of ministers committed to preaching a prophetic message of love and justice, which he believes are inseparable companions that form the foundation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He was recently recognized as one of the \u201c12 Most Effective Preachers in the English-Speaking World\u201d by Baylor University\u2019s George W. Truett Theological Seminary. As part of his community engagement through Trinity United Church of Christ, Dr. Moss led the team that came up with the \u201cMy Life Matters\u201d curriculum; which includes the viral video,\u00a0\u201cGet Home Safely: 10 Rules of Survival\u201d\u00a0created in the aftermath of Michael Brown\u2019s death at the hands of Ferguson, Missouri police.\nDr. Moss was named to the inaugural Root 100, a list that \u201crecognizes emerging and established African-American leaders who are making extraordinary contributions,\u201d according to the publication\u2019s website. Honorees range between ages 25 to 45 and their accomplishments and successes transcend media headlines or statistics.\nWith a unique gift to communicate across generations, Dr. Moss\u2019 creative Bible-based messages have inspired young and old alike. His intergenerational preaching gift has made Dr. Moss a popular speaker on college campuses, at conferences, and churches across the globe. He is highly influenced by the works of Zora Neale Hurston, August Wilson, Howard Thurman, Jazz, and Hip-Hop music. The work and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the pastoral ministry of his father, Rev. Dr. Otis Moss, Jr. of Cleveland, Ohio, have been primary mentors for his spiritual formation.\nThe founder of Unashamed Media Group, a justice centered, faith-based agency committed to producing and curating stories to inspire the heart and challenge the mind, Dr. Moss is the recipient of a 2016 NAACP Image award for his work, which includes providing biblical context and theological support to a myriad of groups and causes, including the #BlackLivesMatter and the #Occupy movements.\nHis earlier publications include:\u00a0Redemption in a Red Light District, and\u00a0The Gospel According to the Wiz: And Other Sermons from Cinema. He co-authored\u00a0The Gospel Re-Mix; How to Reach the Hip-Hop Generation\u00a0with three other contributors, and\u00a0Preach! The Power and Purpose Behind Our Praise, with his father.\nHe is married to his college sweetheart, the former Monica Brown of Orlando, Florida, a Spelman College and Columbia University graduate. They are the proud parents of two creative and humorous children, Elijah Wynton and Makayla Elon.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices"

We invite you to share your stories using the hashtag #LeaveLOUD.\n\nThe Witness BCC exists to empower Black Christians to live into the fullness of who God created us to be.

Since that time, things have gotten worse, not better.\n\nIn recent months, we\u2019ve seen a surge of Black leaders and congregants in predominantly white or multiethnic churches and Christian spaces decide that it\u2019s time for them to go.

Since that time, things have gotten worse, not better.\n\nIn recent months, we\u2019ve seen a surge of Black leaders and congregants in predominantly white or multiethnic churches and Christian spaces decide that it\u2019s time for them to go. We bear witness to the hurt, harm, and frustration that our siblings have experienced. Enough is enough.

                "summary": "Whew! Listen, family...this is the one.\u00a0\n\n10 years ago, Jemar Tisby founded this organization with the hope of achieving racial reconciliation in white evangelical spaces. Eventually, after a barrage of attacks, smears, and racial trauma, the organization changed its name, and Jemar left the place that he thought was his home. What happened? What changed? What did he learn? This is the story like you\u2019ve never heard it before. This is Jemar Tisby\u2019s #LeaveLOUD story.\u00a0\u00a0\n*********\nIn 2018, the New York Times published an article tiled: A Quiet Exodus: Why Black Worshipers Are Leaving White Evangelical Churches that chronicled the plight of Black Christians who quietly exited their churches after their pastors and fellow believers failed to denounce state-sanctioned violence against Black people, white Christian Nationalism, systemic racism, and everyday bigotry. Since that time, things have gotten worse, not better.\u00a0\n\nIn recent months, we\u2019ve seen a surge of Black leaders and congregants in predominantly white or multiethnic churches and Christian spaces decide that it\u2019s time for them to go. We bear witness to the hurt, harm, and frustration that our siblings have experienced. Enough is enough. It\u2019s time to #LeaveLOUD\n\nTo #LeaveLOUD is to tell our stories, to name things for what they are, to take back the dignity we\u2019ve lost while being in institutions that don\u2019t value the fullness of the image of God within us, and to go where we are celebrated and not just tolerated.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor the next several weeks, we will be sharing stories of Black Christians who have made the decision to #LeaveLOUD. We will also be providing thoughtful analysis, words of wisdom, and resources for those who have already left or who are discerning whether they should #LeaveLOUD. We invite you to share your stories using the hashtag #LeaveLOUD.\u00a0\n\nThe Witness BCC exists to empower Black Christians to live into the fullness of who God created us to be. You are not alone.\n\nVisit thewitnessbcc.com for more of our stories.\u00a0\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices"

It challenges Christians to be everyday activists who become brave enough to break the silence and work with others to dismantle systems of injustice and inequality.\n\nLooking through the lens of the biblical narrative of Esther, McNeil challenges Christian reconcilers to recognize the particular pain in our world so they can work together to repair what is broken while maintaining a deep hope in God\u2019s ongoing work for justice. This book provides education and prophetic inspiration for every person who wants to take reconciliation seriously.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
