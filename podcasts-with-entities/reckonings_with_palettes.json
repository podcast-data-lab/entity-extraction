To pick up where the show left off, follow Stephanie Lepp on Twitter: @stephlepp\r\n\r\nABOUT THE SHOW\r\nHow do we change our hearts and minds? \r\n\r\nWhat moves us to shift our political worldviews, transcend extremism, and make other kinds of transformative change? \r\n\r\n\u200bReckonings is an exploration of how we look in the mirror, and grow from what we see. \r\n\r\n\u200bStories have included that of a tough-on-crime prosecutor who revolutionized his understanding of our criminal justice system, a former Facebook executive who's since devoted his life to tackling technology addiction, and a perpetrator and survivor of sexual assault who managed to work through it using restorative justice.\r\n\r\nIf you're new to the show, start with this quick intro: bit.ly/1VypoeX\r\n\r\nThen go for any of these episodes \u2014 Beyond Goliath, A Journalist Reckons With Truth, or A Survivor And Her Perpetrator Find Justice: reckonings.show/episodes\r\n\r\nReckonings is produced by Stephanie Lepp.",

But let me tell you why I'm not there anymore.'' As the head of the Cato Institute\u2019s climate and environmental policy shop, Jerry Taylor was a leading spokesperson for climate skepticism. He waged TV battles against climate activists on the likes of CNN, NBC, and Fox, and says he won all of them. And yet, he's the only paid climate skeptic who's ever flipped.
