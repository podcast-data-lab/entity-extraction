It\u2019s complicated, and we meet people along the way who help her navigate this question. Dr. Jackie Huggins digs into the history of Indigenous peoples\u2019 relation to Blackness, artist/journalist Daniel Browning explains why some young Indigenous people are identifying as \u2019Blak\u2019- without the \u2018C\u2019, and Aurora Liddle Christie ponders her Jamaican-Indigenous Australian roots. Will Rhianna get any closer to understanding her use of the term \u2018Black\u2019?\n      "

It\u2019s a different kind of portrayal of Africa - something Hana has always wanted: a change in the narrative of poverty, war and famine. But something doesn\u2019t feel quite right. She\u2019s trying to just get her popcorn and enjoy the drama and messiness, but she\u2019s conflicted and she\u2019s wondering why. She talks it out with Nigerian writer Damilola Oyedele - someone else who is watching, and thinking at the same time. Plus, we go to Lagos, Nigeria- to hear how people there are reacting there.\n      "
