    "description": "Throughout its reign, the British Empire stole a lot of stuff. Today the Empire's loot sits in museums, galleries, private collections and burial sites with polite plaques. But its history is often messier than the plaques suggest.\n\nIn each episode of this global smash hit podcast, Walkley award-winning journalist, author and genetic potluck, Marc Fennell, takes you on the wild, evocative, sometimes funny, often tragic adventure of how these stolen treasures got to where they live today. These objects will ultimately help us see the modern world \u2014 and ourselves \u2014 in a different light.\n\nThis is a co-production between the ABC and CBC Canada.",

You'll uncover abductions, scandals and a murder investigation.\n\nEpisode One out October 20.\n\nSeason two of Stuff the British Stole is co-produced with CBC Podcasts."

But its history is often messier than the plaques suggest.\n\nIn each episode of this global smash hit podcast, Walkley award-winning journalist, author and genetic potluck, Marc Fennell, takes you on the wild, evocative, sometimes funny, often tragic adventure of how these stolen treasures got to where they live today. These objects will ultimately help us see the modern world - and ourselves - in a different light.\n\nThis is a co-production between the ABC and CBC Canada."
