She also is a writer, and finds there are endless conversations to be had about the craft and psychology of writing. Join her each episode as she talks with a variety of writers - comedians, authors, coaches, speakers, songwriters, TV writers, to name a few - about their craft. The conversations can get personal in nature, as writing is truly an exploration of self.

Young adults have a lot to overcome and learn, including doubting themselves in today\u2019s hyper critical society on social media. Their path will be one of a Good Life if they can discern their values, mission and purpose - tools rarely taught in high school or even college. Her new book, <em>The Good You</em>, was written to press the concept of Help not Hurt out in the world for young adults. She gives four key pillars to look at why you are motivated to make choices in your young life.</p><p></p><p>We talk about the creative process she went through and how exhilarating it feels to write a book. Her moment when she knew she had to write this book came in a dinner conversation when friends were expressing they were struggling with their kids and they asked her, \u201cWhy are your kids not so messed up?\u2019 She understood all her capacities as a mentor, teacher and coach combined provided her kids the tools they needed from her mothering perspective.

She also suggests a writer to be flexible with their book as it evolves.\u00a0</p><p></p><p>Joy is in the process of shopping her book and so we are rooting for her to land an agent to get this amazing book in bookstores all over America!

She gives four key pillars to look at why you are motivated to make choices in your young life.\n\nWe talk about the creative process she went through and how exhilarating it feels to write a book. Her moment when she knew she had to write this book came in a dinner conversation when friends were expressing they were struggling with their kids and they asked her, \u201cWhy are your kids not so messed up?\u2019 She understood all her capacities as a mentor, teacher and coach combined provided her kids the tools they needed from her mothering perspective. The book started as a guide for mothers to not raise kids who are not screwed up, and it morphed into a book focused on how to be a good person in a simple non-complicated way.\n\nWe chat about:\n\n* Writing a true vernacular and terminology for young readers as a midlife writer.\n\n* When she realized her self-help book needed her story so the readers could invest in her as an author.\n\n* Writing five drafts and how the vision has changed of the book.\n\nHer advice to any writer starting the process is to be clear about your motivation for writing a book. Remember why you initially started which anchors you on days you are staring at a half-baked book. She also suggests a writer to be flexible with their book as it evolves.\u00a0\n\nJoy is in the process of shopping her book and so we are rooting for her to land an agent to get this amazing book in bookstores all over America! What a great graduation gift!\u00a0\n\nIf you enjoyed this show, may we suggest other episodes you may like with Book Client/Authors of Kim\u2019s?

            "contentSnippet": "As I come from a two decade run of working in the movies, chord of nostalgia is plucked in me when I get to have an entertainment writer on the show, in TV nonetheless, which I could never break into. Nick Morton co-wrote the first season of \u201cCooper\u2019s Bar\u201d for AMC which stars Rhea Seehorn from Better Call Saul and she has a 2022 Emmy nom from his writing. He is also a movie producer\u2026 remember that gorgeous film Ray with Jamie Foxx?\n\nJoin us as we talk about how Nick approaches writing, and what have been some of his favorite Hollywood experiences. He shares the feeling of being in the gray area for a while when developing movies for a prestigious company, which led him to do some of his worst drinking. Now a sober writer, he was able to take his life experiences and put them into a show on a sober recovery house coming out soon on Crackle. The show stars Matthew Lillard and Blythe Danner. \u00a0He has written for many online magazines including Mr. Porter and The Scoop. He hosts the popular podcast The Drunkalogues.\n\nIf you enjoyed this show, may we suggest other similar episodes you may like?

We think we need these epic tragedies or great successes to justify writing as our unique selves. Look around!\u00a0 There is material happening everywhere and self-awareness is key to developing a commentary and a narrative about your life. When we tune in creatively, the world is real time offering us endless amounts of material. Let that endless monkey mind work in your favor and get it down in the computer.\u00a0 In today\u2019s episode, host Kim O\u2019Hara shares her creative journey writing about her house buying experience and her first year as a single woman homesteader in Los Angeles. Called a mix between Pema Chodron and Anne Lamott (which makes her blush), Kim shares how she allows life to unfold over the year and makes a point to write about each experience from a gunman on her roof (and the crappy boyfriend who never checks on her), to an evolving and spiritual battle with nine foot palm fronds. She doesn\u2019t miss a bit of detail and peppers in comedy, as well as her continual struggle with faith, fear and loneliness.\u00a0</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t wait ten years to start writing about your emotions and observations while they are happening real time, especially if you have taken a leap in your life. For Kim, buying a house was a huge accomplishment, and her trials and tribulations that range from micromanaging growing grass to stray cat management gives courage to others to step up and make a leap as homeowners, or whatever area in their lives that calls for meaning!\u00a0 Go towards what makes you happy when you write, and what thematically fills your writing cup, instructs Kim. Your desire to land your experiences on paper will be infectious and equally connect with your readers.\u00a0</span></p> <p>Are you enjoying the podcast?

When we tune in creatively, the world is real time offering us endless amounts of material. Let that endless monkey mind work in your favor and get it down in the computer.\u00a0 In today\u2019s episode, host Kim O\u2019Hara shares her creative journey writing about her house buying experience and her first year as a single woman homesteader in Los Angeles. Called a mix between Pema Chodron and Anne Lamott (which makes her blush), Kim shares how she allows life to unfold over the year and makes a point to write about each experience from a gunman on her roof (and the crappy boyfriend who never checks on her), to an evolving and spiritual battle with nine foot palm fronds. She doesn\u2019t miss a bit of detail and peppers in comedy, as well as her continual struggle with faith, fear and loneliness.\u00a0\n \u00a0\n Don\u2019t wait ten years to start writing about your emotions and observations while they are happening real time, especially if you have taken a leap in your life. For Kim, buying a house was a huge accomplishment, and her trials and tribulations that range from micromanaging growing grass to stray cat management gives courage to others to step up and make a leap as homeowners, or whatever area in their lives that calls for meaning!\u00a0 Go towards what makes you happy when you write, and what thematically fills your writing cup, instructs Kim. Your desire to land your experiences on paper will be infectious and equally connect with your readers.\u00a0\n Are you enjoying the podcast?

            "contentSnippet": "After the episode, The Bigger Message in the Book, was my highest rated and downloaded episode, I reserved another week\u2019s time slot for more book mindset tips and tools. Dealing with Rejection, Distraction, and Justification. I have been writing for a long long time, in the movies, and also in books. I also have been helping storytellers find their voice for many decades (which makes me seem really old, but who\u2019s counting\u2026).\u00a0\n \u00a0\n In this recording, I address the three horsemen that stand in the way of writers successfully saying yes to their book journey: Rejection, Distraction, and Justification.\u00a0 I pack a lot of psychological nuance into this episode as humans can exhaust themselves jumping through hoops to avoid what they are called to do.\u00a0 It is truly astonishing how much resistance is prevalent with book writing contrasted by an equally voracious desire to become an author.\u00a0 The polarity seems insurmountable but I can assure you, there are not only paths to least resistance, but solutions to get through the mud and on the broad highway to writer freedom!\n \u00a0\n We love bringing in amazing guests every week, as well as dropping writing truth bombs. \u00a0We appreciate any donations to keep our doors open!
