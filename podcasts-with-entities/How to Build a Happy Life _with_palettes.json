But the pressure to pretend we are perfect is exactly the thing holding us back from experiencing the happiness we seek\u2014and limiting our ability to be our whole, authentic selves.\u00a0\nIn this episode of How to Build a Happy Life, we\u2019ll define what we mean by \u201cauthenticity\u201d and explore the psychological underpinnings of our ego-driven identities. A conversation with the clinical psychologist and mindfulness expert Dr. Shefali helps us work through one of the most challenging questions of all: Who am I?\nThis episode was produced by Rebecca Rashid and is hosted by Arthur C.
