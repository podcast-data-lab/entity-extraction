Jesus is claiming to bring the eternal seventh-day rest into reality.</p><p>In part 2 (7:15-21:15), Tim dives into words of Jesus in Matthew.\u00a0</p><p>Matthew 11:25-30</p><p>\u201cAt that time Jesus said, \u2018I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in your sight. All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal him.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Come to me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tim quotes from Samuele Bacchiocchi.</p><p>\u201cThe metaphor of the \u2018yoke\u2019 was commonly used to express subordination and loyalty to God, especially through obedience to his law. Thus Jeremiah speaks of the leaders of the people who knew \u2018the law of their God, but they all alike had broken the yoke, they had burst the bonds\u2019 (5:5; cf. 2:20). In the following chapter, the same prophet says to the people: \u2018Find rest for your souls\u2019 by learning anew obedience to God\u2019s law (6:6; cf. Num 25:3). Rabbis often spoke of \u2018the yoke of the Torah,\u2019 \u2018the yoke of the kingdom of heaven,\u2019 \u2018the yoke of the commandments,\u2019 \u2018the yoke of God.\u2019 Rabbi Nehunya b. Kanah (ca. 70) is reported to have said: \u2018He that takes upon himself the yoke of the Law, from him shall be taken away the yoke of the kingdom and the yoke of worldly care\u2019 (Pirke Aboth 3:5). What this means is that devotion to the law and its interpretation is supposed to free a person from the troubles and cares of this world.\u201d</p><p>(Samuele Bacchiocchi, \u201cMatthew 11:28-30: Jesus\u2019 Rest and the Sabbath,\u201d p. 300-303.)</p><p>The quote continues:</p><p>\u201cMatthew sets forth the \u2018yoke\u2019 of Christ, not as commitment to a new Torah, but as dedication to a Person who is the true Interpreter and Fulfiller of the Law and the Prophets. The emphasis on the Person is self-evident in our logion: \u2018Come to me . . . take my yoke . . . learn from me ... I will give you rest.\u2019 Moreover, the parallel structure of vss. 28 and 29 indicates that taking the \u2018yoke\u2019 of Jesus is equivalent to \u2018come to\u2019 and \u2018learn from\u2019 him. That is to say, it is to personally accept Jesus as Messiah. Such an acceptance is an \u2018easy\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019 yoke, not because Jesus weakens the demands of the law (cf. Matt 5:20), but because, as T. W. Manson puts it, \u2018Jesus claims to do for men what the Law claimed to do; but in a different way.\u2019 The difference lies in Christ\u2019s claim to offer to his disciples (note the emphatic kago) the rest of Messianic redemption to which the law, and more specifically, the sabbath, had always pointed.\u201d</p><p>(Samuele Bacchiocchi, \u201cMatthew 11:28-30: Jesus\u2019 Rest and the Sabbath,\u201d p. 300-303.)</p><p>In part 3 (21:15-30:00), Tim moves into the next story in Matthew.</p><p>Matthew 12:1-14</p><p>\u201cAt that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and his disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat. But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, \u2018Look, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on a Sabbath.\u2019 But he said to them, \u2018Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, he and his companions, how he entered the house of God, and they ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him, but for the priests alone? Or have you not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are innocent? But I say to you that one greater than the temple is here. But if you had known what this means, \u201cI desire compassion, and not a sacrifice,\u201d you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u2019</p><p>\u201cDeparting from there, he went into their synagogue. And a man was there whose hand was withered. And they questioned Jesus, asking, \u2018Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\u2019\u2014so that they might accuse him. And he said to them, \u2018What man is there among you who has a sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\u2019 Then he said to the man, \u2018Stretch out your hand!\u2019 He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other.\u201d</p><p>Tim says that the controversies caused by Jesus on the Sabbath are not meant to show Jesus as divisive. Rather, when Jesus says he is \u201cLord of the Sabbath,\u201d he is saying fundamentally the same thing as when he declares, \u201cThe Kingdom of God is here.\u201d Both of these phrases are declarations by Jesus that he is beginning the restoration of creation.</p><p>In part 4 (30:00-38:00), Tim and Jon have a quick discussion about practicing the Sabbath, taking one day out of seven to rest. Did Jesus value this? Yes! Jesus went to synagogue on Sabbath. But Jesus seems to place a greater importance on the concept of the Sabbath. Jesus is effectually saying that what the Sabbath pointed to\u2014a time of constant communion between God and man\u2014is here because he is here.</p><p>In part 5 (38:00-61:30), Tim talks about instances of Sabbath practice in Paul\u2019s writings.</p><p>Romans 14:1-12</p><p>\u201cAs for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him. Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOne person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; for it is written,</p><p>\u201c\u2018As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,</p><p>and every tongue shall confess to God.\u2019</p><p>\u201cSo then each of us will give an account of himself to God.\u201d</p><p>Tim also shares from Paul\u2019s writings in Colossians.</p><p>Colossians 2:16-19</p><p>\u201cTherefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.\u201d</p><p>Tim notes that eating kosher and Sabbath practices were controversial issues in the early Church as they are now. Tim also notes that once the Christian movement became majority non-Jewish, the Christian movement quickly lost respect for its Jewish roots and traditions.</p><p>Tim then asks, based on Paul, whether modern Christians should have some sort of Sabbath practice? It seems that Paul was flexible. He always went to synagogue and even fulfilled Jewish vows. But he also stood up for Gentiles who had no history or desire to begin practicing Sabbath law. Instead, Paul was excited to build a Christian community where all experienced equality under the lordship of Jesus.</p><p>In part 6 (61:30-end), the guys quickly talk about the resurrection narrative at the end of the Gospel of Mark.</p><p>Mark 16:1-3</p><p>\u201cWhen the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb And they were saying to one another, \u2018Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jesus\u2019 resurrection is literally and metaphorically the first dawning of a new week.

He was literally raised on the first rays of a new week, and metaphorically, this represented Jesus and all who follow him entering a new age of communion with God.\nThe Sabbath practice and the traditions that surround it has always been a controversial topic. As Gentiles who had no Jewish or Sabbath background fell in love with Jesus, the church began to practice or not practice Sabbath in a variety of ways.\n\nSHOW NOTES:\nIn part 1 (0-7:15), Tim and Jon review the conversation so far. Jesus is claiming to bring the eternal seventh-day rest into reality.\nIn part 2 (7:15-21:15), Tim dives into words of Jesus in Matthew.\u00a0\nMatthew 11:25-30\n\u201cAt that time Jesus said, \u2018I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in your sight. All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal him.\n\u201c\u2018Come to me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\u2019\u201d\nTim quotes from Samuele Bacchiocchi.\n\u201cThe metaphor of the \u2018yoke\u2019 was commonly used to express subordination and loyalty to God, especially through obedience to his law. Thus Jeremiah speaks of the leaders of the people who knew \u2018the law of their God, but they all alike had broken the yoke, they had burst the bonds\u2019 (5:5; cf. 2:20). In the following chapter, the same prophet says to the people: \u2018Find rest for your souls\u2019 by learning anew obedience to God\u2019s law (6:6; cf. Num 25:3). Rabbis often spoke of \u2018the yoke of the Torah,\u2019 \u2018the yoke of the kingdom of heaven,\u2019 \u2018the yoke of the commandments,\u2019 \u2018the yoke of God.\u2019 Rabbi Nehunya b. Kanah (ca. 70) is reported to have said: \u2018He that takes upon himself the yoke of the Law, from him shall be taken away the yoke of the kingdom and the yoke of worldly care\u2019 (Pirke Aboth 3:5). What this means is that devotion to the law and its interpretation is supposed to free a person from the troubles and cares of this world.\u201d\n(Samuele Bacchiocchi, \u201cMatthew 11:28-30: Jesus\u2019 Rest and the Sabbath,\u201d p. 300-303.)\nThe quote continues:\n\u201cMatthew sets forth the \u2018yoke\u2019 of Christ, not as commitment to a new Torah, but as dedication to a Person who is the true Interpreter and Fulfiller of the Law and the Prophets. The emphasis on the Person is self-evident in our logion: \u2018Come to me . . . take my yoke . . . learn from me ... I will give you rest.\u2019 Moreover, the parallel structure of vss. 28 and 29 indicates that taking the \u2018yoke\u2019 of Jesus is equivalent to \u2018come to\u2019 and \u2018learn from\u2019 him. That is to say, it is to personally accept Jesus as Messiah. Such an acceptance is an \u2018easy\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019 yoke, not because Jesus weakens the demands of the law (cf. Matt 5:20), but because, as T. W. Manson puts it, \u2018Jesus claims to do for men what the Law claimed to do; but in a different way.\u2019 The difference lies in Christ\u2019s claim to offer to his disciples (note the emphatic kago) the rest of Messianic redemption to which the law, and more specifically, the sabbath, had always pointed.\u201d\n(Samuele Bacchiocchi, \u201cMatthew 11:28-30: Jesus\u2019 Rest and the Sabbath,\u201d p. 300-303.)\nIn part 3 (21:15-30:00), Tim moves into the next story in Matthew.\nMatthew 12:1-14\n\u201cAt that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and his disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat. But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, \u2018Look, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on a Sabbath.\u2019 But he said to them, \u2018Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, he and his companions, how he entered the house of God, and they ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him, but for the priests alone? Or have you not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are innocent? But I say to you that one greater than the temple is here. But if you had known what this means, \u201cI desire compassion, and not a sacrifice,\u201d you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u2019\n\u201cDeparting from there, he went into their synagogue. And a man was there whose hand was withered. And they questioned Jesus, asking, \u2018Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\u2019\u2014so that they might accuse him. And he said to them, \u2018What man is there among you who has a sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\u2019 Then he said to the man, \u2018Stretch out your hand!\u2019 He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other.\u201d\nTim says that the controversies caused by Jesus on the Sabbath are not meant to show Jesus as divisive. Rather, when Jesus says he is \u201cLord of the Sabbath,\u201d he is saying fundamentally the same thing as when he declares, \u201cThe Kingdom of God is here.\u201d Both of these phrases are declarations by Jesus that he is beginning the restoration of creation.\nIn part 4 (30:00-38:00), Tim and Jon have a quick discussion about practicing the Sabbath, taking one day out of seven to rest. Did Jesus value this? Yes! Jesus went to synagogue on Sabbath. But Jesus seems to place a greater importance on the concept of the Sabbath. Jesus is effectually saying that what the Sabbath pointed to\u2014a time of constant communion between God and man\u2014is here because he is here.\nIn part 5 (38:00-61:30), Tim talks about instances of Sabbath practice in Paul\u2019s writings.\nRomans 14:1-12\n\u201cAs for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him. Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.\u00a0\n\u201cOne person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.\n\u201cWhy do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; for it is written,\n\u201c\u2018As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,\nand every tongue shall confess to God.\u2019\n\u201cSo then each of us will give an account of himself to God.\u201d\nTim also shares from Paul\u2019s writings in Colossians.\nColossians 2:16-19\n\u201cTherefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.\u201d\nTim notes that eating kosher and Sabbath practices were controversial issues in the early Church as they are now. Tim also notes that once the Christian movement became majority non-Jewish, the Christian movement quickly lost respect for its Jewish roots and traditions.\nTim then asks, based on Paul, whether modern Christians should have some sort of Sabbath practice? It seems that Paul was flexible. He always went to synagogue and even fulfilled Jewish vows. But he also stood up for Gentiles who had no history or desire to begin practicing Sabbath law. Instead, Paul was excited to build a Christian community where all experienced equality under the lordship of Jesus.\nIn part 6 (61:30-end), the guys quickly talk about the resurrection narrative at the end of the Gospel of Mark.\nMark 16:1-3\n\u201cWhen the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb And they were saying to one another, \u2018Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?\u2019\u201d\nJesus\u2019 resurrection is literally and metaphorically the first dawning of a new week.

            "contentSnippet": "QUOTE\n\"What Jesus is claiming is that the ultimate jubilee that the prophets pointed to has begun. Here it is. I\u2019m doing it. It\u2019s a massive claim.\"\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nThe Sabbath was a big deal to Jesus. He and the Jewish religious leaders often disagreed over what observing the Sabbath should actually mean.\nJesus announced his public ministry at a synagogue on the Sabbath by reading from Isaiah 61, which is a prophecy about a future time of jubilee.\nJesus claimed that he was fulfilling all that the ritual and symbolism in the Sabbath pointed to. Jesus claimed to usher in a new age of peace and rest.\n\nSHOW NOTES\nIn part 1 (0-29:15), Tim and Jon review the conversation so far.\nTim shares a quote from Samuele Bacchiocchi and his scholarly work, \u201cSabbatical Typologies of Messianic Redemption.\u201d His essay examines traits of Genesis 1-2 that are carried forward in Jewish texts of the Second Temple period. One of the things that characterized the giving of the Sabbath laws was man\u2019s relationship to and peace with the animals. Consider this excerpt from the Babylonian Talmud.\n\u201cA. A man should not go out with (1) a sword, (2) bow, (3) shield, (4) club, or (5) spear.\n\u201cB. And if he went out, he is liable to a sin-offering.\n\u201cC. R. Eliezer says, \u2018They are ornaments for him.\u2019\n\u201cD. And sages say, \u2018They are nothing but ugly,\n\u201cE. \u2018since it is said, \u201cAnd they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more\u201d (Isa. 2:4).\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n(Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 12a: Jacob Neusner, The Babylonian Talmud: A Translation and Commentary, vol. 2 [Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 2011], 269.)\nTim also shares Bacchiocchi\u2019s findings on the connection between the themes of food, the Sabbath, and material abundance.\nTim shares from 2 Baruch 29:4-6, \u201cthe Messiah shall begin to be revealed ... the earth also shall yield its fruit ten thousandfold and on each vine there shall be a thousand branches, and each branch shall produce a thousand clusters, and each cluster produce a thousand grapes and each grape produce a cor of wine.\u201d\nAbundance through unending food, Tim says, was one of the signs viewed by the prophets as an indication that the Messiah had come.\nTim also shares from Bacchiocchi\u2019s findings on the theme of what he calls \u201cJoy and Light.\u201d Bacchiocchi cites Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Zimra.\n\u201c\u2018For the Sabbath day,\u2019 that is, for the day which darkness did not attend. You find that it is written of other days, \u2018And there was evening and there was morning, one day.\u2019 But the words, \u2018There was evening\u2019 are not written of the Sabbath. And so, the Sabbath light continued thirty-six hours.\u201d\n(The Midrash on Psalms, translated by William G. Braude [New Haven, 1959], p. 112. Quoted in Samuele Bacchiocchi, \u201cSabbatical Typologies of Messianic Redemption,\u201d p. 159.)\nIn part 2 (29:15-34:00) Tim and Jon dive into Luke 4.\nLuke 4:14-21\n\u201cJesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:\n\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is on me,\nbecause he has anointed me\nto proclaim good news to the poor.\nHe has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners\nand recovery of sight for the blind,\nto set the oppressed free,\nto proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor.\n\u201cThen he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, \u2018Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\u2019\u201d\nIn part 3 (34:00-50:45), Tim examines the word \u201crelease\u201d or \u201cfreedom\u201d in the Isaiah passage (Grk. aphesis, \u201crelease,\u201d or Heb. deror, \u201cJubilee liberation.\u201d See Isaiah 61:1 and Leviticus 25:10). This is the common word for \u201cforgiveness\u201d in Luke (Luke 1:77 and 3:3), but the word\u2019s meaning is broader in this instance. It\u2019s denoting release from burden or bondage. The word in Isaiah 61 is rooted in the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25), and it is about release from the social consequences of society\u2019s collective sin\u2014a freedom from debt, slavery, poverty, and oppression.\nTim notes that forgiveness and release are the same word in the New Testament. The guys talk about how Jesus would have viewed \u201creleasing\u201d people from slavery to sin.\nIn part 4 (50:45-58:30), Tim and Jon talk about the controversy Jesus created around the Sabbath. They note that the conflict was not about whether the Sabbath should be observed but instead about what that observance of the Sabbath entailed in practical terms.\nTake for instance this story from Matthew 12.\nMatthew 12:9-13\u00a0\n\u201cDeparting from there, he went into their synagogue. And a man was there whose hand was withered. And they questioned Jesus, asking, \u2018Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\u2019\u2014so that they might accuse him. And he said to them, \u2018What man is there among you who has a sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\u2019 Then he said to the man, \u2018Stretch out your hand!\u2019 He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other.\u201d\nTim cites scholar R.T. France on this passage:\n\u201cFundamental to the rabbinic discussion was the agreed list (m.\u0160abb. 7:2) of 39 categories of activity which were to be classified as \u2018work\u2019 for this purpose, some of which are very specific (\u2018writing two letters, erasing in order to write two letters\u2019) others so broad as to need considerable further specification (\u2018building, pulling down\u2019), while the last (\u2018taking anything from one \u201cdomain\u201d [normally a private courtyard] to another\u2019) is so open-ended as to cover a vast range of daily activities. The 39 categories of work do not explicitly include traveling, but this too was regarded as \u2018work,\u2019 a \u2018Sabbath-day\u2019s journey\u2019 being limited to 2,000 cubits, a little over half a mile. These two rules together made Sabbath life potentially so inconvenient that the Pharisees developed an elaborate system of \u2018boundary-extensions\u2019 (\u02bferubin) to allow more freedom of movement without violating the basic rules. The \u02bferub system illustrates an essential element of all this scribal development of Sabbath law: its aim was not simply to make life difficult (though it must often have seemed like that), but to work out a way in which people could cope with the practicalities of life within the limits of their very rigorous understanding of \u2018work.\u2019 The elaboration of details is intended to leave nothing to chance, so that no one can inadvertently come anywhere near violating the law itself. Some rabbis spoke about this as \u2018putting up a fence around the law.\u2019\u201d\n(R. T. France, The Gospel of Matthew, The New International Commentary on the New Testament [Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B.

I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,\u2019 declares the Lord, \u2018and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.\u2019\u201d\nTim notes that this is a very famous verse in the Bible, but many people aren\u2019t aware of its original context\u2014a promise from God that Israel will return from exile.\nIn part 3 (27:30\u201346:45), Tim dives into Daniel 9:20, a passage commonly known as \u201cthe seventy sevens.\u201d\nDaniel 9:20-27\n\u201cWhile I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request to the Lord my God for his holy hill\u2014while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice. He instructed me and said to me, \u2018Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding. As soon as you began to pray, a word went out, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision: Seventy \u201csevens\u201d are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the Most Holy Place.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Know and understand this: from the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven sevens, and sixty-two sevens. It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble. After the sixty-two sevens, the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: war will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed. He will confirm a covenant with many for one seven. In the middle of the seven he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.\u2019\u201d\nThis passage, Tim says, maps directly onto the two Jeremiah prophecies.\nTim notes that Daniel would have been heartbroken because he was hoping that this would have been a proclamation of good news that Israel would return from exile. Instead, the message is that Israel has a long way to go in its exile.\nThere are many ways to read and interpret the 490 years (seventy sevens) in Daniel 9. Tim shares about a study from scholar Roger Beckwith, who has done an enormous study on the various interpretations of Daniel 9 in his paper, \u201cDaniel 9 and the Date of Messiah\u2019s Coming in Essene, Hellenistic, Pharisaic, Zealot and Early Christian Computation\u201d (see show resources for link).\nIn part 4 (46:45\u2013end), Tim and Jon cover an important prophecy in Isaiah about a coming jubilee.\nIsaiah 61:1-3\n\u201cThe Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me,\nbecause the Lord has anointed me\nto proclaim good news to the poor.\nHe has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,\nto proclaim freedom for the captives\nand release from darkness for the prisoners,\nto proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor\nand the day of vengeance of our God,\nto comfort all who mourn,\nand provide for those who grieve in Zion\u2014\nto bestow on them a crown of beauty\ninstead of ashes,\nthe oil of joy\ninstead of mourning,\nand a garment of praise\ninstead of a spirit of despair.\nThey will be called oaks of righteousness,\na planting of the Lord\nfor the display of his splendor.\u201d\nTim shares a quote from scholar Bradley Gregory in his essay on Isaiah 61, called \u201cThe Post Exilic Exile in Isaiah.\u201d\n\u201cIn Isaiah 40-55, the Babylonian exile is understood as an image of the Egyptian captivity. In the last ten chapters of Isaiah (56-66), the oppressive situation in Jerusalem after the exile has become another symbol. One gets the impression that the author doesn\u2019t see the situation after the exile as any better than the situation in Babylon or enslaved in ancient Egypt. In all cases Israel is shackled because of sin, awaiting deliverance by Yahweh. The prescriptions for the jubilee have been eschatologized\u2014the jubilee is now a metaphor and an image for a future hope. Isaiah has moved the concept for jubilee from a law to a concept of future deliverance.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShow Resources:\n\nRoger T.

All the time that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you lived in it.\u201d</p><p>Jon notes that Western culture allows us to think that we own land. However, owning land in ancient Israel wasn\u2019t reality. Instead, the land would return to the family originally entrusted with it every fifty years. God considers the land to be his, and Israel is tenants upon it.</p><p>In part 3 (32:40-end), Tim finishes Leviticus 26.</p><p>Leviticus 26:40-45</p><p>\u201cIf they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their forefathers, in their unfaithfulness which they committed against me, and also in their acting with hostility against me\u2026 or if their uncircumcised heart becomes humbled so that they then make amends for their iniquity, then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and I will remember also my covenant with Isaac, and my covenant with Abraham as well, and I will remember the land.

            "content": "<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><p>\u201cSince it occurred usually only once a lifetime, an impoverished Israelite would spend most of his life anticipating this event of restoration. So when we get to Jesus and the Jesus movement, it was a jubilee movement. Jesus started his mission by reading from Isaiah 61. He said it\u2019s the favorable year of the Lord, the year of release.\u201d</p><p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong></p><ul><li>The Year of Jubilee in Leviticus 25 is one of the most radical ideas in the Bible. Every 50 years, every Israelite was supposed to return to their original piece of allotted land.</li><li>The jubilee would have effectively prevented cycles of intergenerational poverty and create a social and economic parity that would make Israel unique among all nations.</li><li>Jesus announced that he was enacting the Year of Jubilee when he launched his public ministry.</li></ul><p><strong>SHOW NOTES</strong></p><p>In part 1 (0-7:30), the guys quickly review the conversation so far.</p><p>In part 2 (7:30-21:30), Tim dives into Leviticus 24.</p><p>Leviticus 24:1-4</p><p>\u201cThe Lord said to Moses, \u2018Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually. Outside the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the Lord from evening till morning, continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord must be tended continually.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tim shares a quote from Jacob Milgrom.</p><p>\u201cThere are three kinds of oil. The first when the olives are pounded in order and put into a basket, and the oil oozes out. Rabbi Judah says, \u2018Around the basket and around the sides, the oil that runs out of the basket, this gives the first oil\u2026. The first oil is fit for lampstands.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tim and Jon observe that the first oil would be the safest, least likely to smoke. This would keep the soot for accumulating in the rooms where it is burning.</p><p>Tim makes several observations about the lamp from Leviticus 24.</p><ul><li>The lamp (\u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 / <i>ma\u2019or</i>) is attended to every evening so that its light burns perpetually (\u201cfrom evening to evening,\u201d borrowing language from Genesis 1).</li><li>The lamp is described with the vocabulary of the sun, moon, and stars in Genesis 1. They are symbols of the divine glory and markers \u201cfor signs and for seasons\u201d\u2014that is, for the appointed feasts (Gen. 1:14-16).</li><li>The lamp is a symbol of the divine light that perpetually shines upon Israel, who is represented by the bread.

Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you\u2014for yourself, your male and female servants, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you, as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.\n\u2018\u201cCount off seven sabbath years\u2014seven times seven years\u2014so that the seven sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years. Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land. Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each of you is to return to your family property and to your own clan. The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines. For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.\n\u2018\u201cIn this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property. If you sell land to any of your own people or buy land from them, do not take advantage of each other. You are to buy from your own people on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And they are to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops. When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops. Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the Lord your God.\n\u2018\u201cFollow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land. Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety. You may ask, \u2018What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?\u2019 I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years. While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.\n\u2018\u201cThe land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers. Throughout the land that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land.\n\u2018\u201cIf one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem what they have sold. If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves, they are to determine the value for the years since they sold it and refund the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then go back to their own property. But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and they can then go back to their property.\n\u2018\u201cAnyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time the seller may redeem it. If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer\u2019s descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee. But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.\n\u2018\u201cThe Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess. So the property of the Levites is redeemable\u2014that is, a house sold in any town they hold\u2014and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites. But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.\n\u2018\u201cIf any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you. Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you. You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.\n\u2018\u201cIf any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to you, do not make them work as slaves. They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee. Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors. Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves. Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God.\n\u2018\u201cYour male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.\n\u2018\u201cIf a foreigner residing among you becomes rich and any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to the foreigner or to a member of the foreigner\u2019s clan, they retain the right of redemption after they have sold themselves. One of their relatives may redeem them: An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in their clan may redeem them. Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves. They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years. If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share of the price paid for them. If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly. They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them ruthlessly.\n\u2018\u201cEven if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee, for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.\u201d\u2019\u201d\nTim makes a few observations about the practice of jubilee and the Year of Jubilee. Giving people back their ancestral land would prevent the formation of monopolies and land owner dynasties. It would be a consistent (about once a lifetime) check to level the economic playing field of ancient Israel.\nTim also notes that there are no narrative stories about Israel actually observing this Year of Jubilee.

            "contentSnippet": "QUOTE\n\u201cSince it occurred usually only once a lifetime, an impoverished Israelite would spend most of his life anticipating this event of restoration. So when we get to Jesus and the Jesus movement, it was a jubilee movement. Jesus started his mission by reading from Isaiah 61. He said it\u2019s the favorable year of the Lord, the year of release.\u201d\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nThe Year of Jubilee in Leviticus 25 is one of the most radical ideas in the Bible. Every 50 years, every Israelite was supposed to return to their original piece of allotted land.\nThe jubilee would have effectively prevented cycles of intergenerational poverty and create a social and economic parity that would make Israel unique among all nations.\nJesus announced that he was enacting the Year of Jubilee when he launched his public ministry.\n\nSHOW NOTES\nIn part 1 (0-7:30), the guys quickly review the conversation so far.\nIn part 2 (7:30-21:30), Tim dives into Leviticus 24.\nLeviticus 24:1-4\n\u201cThe Lord said to Moses, \u2018Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually. Outside the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the Lord from evening till morning, continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord must be tended continually.\u2019\u201d\nTim shares a quote from Jacob Milgrom.\n\u201cThere are three kinds of oil. The first when the olives are pounded in order and put into a basket, and the oil oozes out. Rabbi Judah says, \u2018Around the basket and around the sides, the oil that runs out of the basket, this gives the first oil\u2026. The first oil is fit for lampstands.\u2019\u201d\nTim and Jon observe that the first oil would be the safest, least likely to smoke. This would keep the soot for accumulating in the rooms where it is burning.\nTim makes several observations about the lamp from Leviticus 24.\n\nThe lamp (\u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 / ma\u2019or) is attended to every evening so that its light burns perpetually (\u201cfrom evening to evening,\u201d borrowing language from Genesis 1).\nThe lamp is described with the vocabulary of the sun, moon, and stars in Genesis 1. They are symbols of the divine glory and markers \u201cfor signs and for seasons\u201d\u2014that is, for the appointed feasts (Gen. 1:14-16).\nThe lamp is a symbol of the divine light that perpetually shines upon Israel, who is represented by the bread. Numbers 8:1-4 tells us that the light of the menorah \u201cwill give light in the front of the lampstand\u201d (v. 2), shining in the direction of the bread.\nLeviticus 24:5-9 says that the bread is to be placed directly across from the light. Just as new bread is baked every Sabbath, so Israel is \u201crecreated\u201d every Sabbath. This bread is called \u201can eternal covenant\u201d (Lev. 24:8), meaning it\u2019s a symbol of the eternal relationship between God and Israel.\n\nTim shares this quote from Michael Morales:\n\u201cThe menorah lampstand contains the same seven-fold structure, symbolizing the entire seven-part structure of time provided by the heavenly lights\u2026. Just as the cosmos was created for humanity\u2019s Sabbath communion and fellowship with God, so too tabernacle was established for Israel\u2019s Sabbath communion and fellowship with God \u201cevery day of the Sabbath\u201d (Lev 24:8). This ritual drama of the lights and the bread, symbolizes the ideal Sabbath, the tribes of Israel basking in the divine light, being renewed in God\u2019s presence Sabbath by Sabbath.\u201d\n(Michael Morales, Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord, 189-190 [with embedded quote by Vern Poythress].)\nIn part 3 (21:30-36:00), Tim dives into Leviticus 25 and the practice of jubilee.\nLeviticus 25:1-55\n\u201cThe Lord said to Moses at Mount Sinai, \u2018Speak to the Israelites and say to them: \u201cWhen you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a sabbath to the Lord. For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops. But in the seventh year the land is to have a year of sabbath rest, a sabbath to the Lord. Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards. Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest. Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you\u2014for yourself, your male and female servants, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you, as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.\n\u2018\u201cCount off seven sabbath years\u2014seven times seven years\u2014so that the seven sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years. Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land. Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each of you is to return to your family property and to your own clan. The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines.

The seventh age is entirely Sabbath and rest in the life everlasting.\u201d</i> \u2013 Rabbi Eliezer</p><p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong></p><ul><li>The seven festivals or feasts in the Jewish sacred calendar are integral to understanding the theme of the seventh-day rest in the Bible.</li><li>These feasts have symbolic meaning connecting back to the creation account in Genesis and the story of the Exodus. They are meant to act as a way to remember and teach.</li></ul><p><strong>SHOW NOTES</strong></p><p>In part 1 (0-16:10), Tim and Jon recap the conversation so far, including the story of God giving Moses the Ten Commandments and instructions for the tabernacle. Interestingly, Tim notes that he isn\u2019t pointing out all the layers of seven in the Bible, just highlighting some of the significant ones. For example, Moses goes up and down the mountain to commune with God seven times in the whole story of the TaNaK.</p><p>Tim moves into the next part of the story. God is now dwelling in the tabernacle, also known as the tent of meeting. Unfortunately, God\u2019s presence is so intense that no one can go in.</p><p>In part 2 (16:10-25:00), Tim expands on the theme of Sabbath in Exodus.</p><p>Exodus 23:9-12\u00a0</p><p><i>Do not oppress a foreigner; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt. For six years you are to sow your fields and harvest the crops, but during the seventh year let the land lie unplowed and unused. Then the poor among your people may get food from it, and the wild animals may eat what is left. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.</i></p><p><i>Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work, so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and so that the slave born in your household and the foreigner living among you may be refreshed.</i></p><p>Tim observes that Sabbath rest isn\u2019t just for the Jews. It\u2019s also rest for the servants, the land, and the animals. All of creation is called to participate in seventh-day rest.</p><p>In part 3 (25:00-35:00), Tim looks at a passage from Deuteronomy 15.\u00a0</p><p>Deuteronomy 15:1-6</p><p><i>At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people, because the Lord\u2019s time for canceling debts has been proclaimed. You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you. However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you, if only you fully obey the Lord your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today. For the Lord your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you.</i></p><p>Cancelling debts would sometimes happen in the ancient world when a new ruler came into power as an act of political and social favor. What\u2019s unique about the Jewish idea in Deuteronomy, Tim notes, is that this release from debts is meant to be observed independently of any kingship or political system.</p><p>In part 4 (35:00-44:00), Tim goes back to Leviticus to trace out the appointed feasts.</p><p>Leviticus 23:2-4</p><p><i>The Lord said to Moses, \u201cSpeak to the Israelites and say to them: \u2018These are my appointed festivals, the appointed festivals of the Lord, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>There are six days when you may work, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, a day of sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; wherever you live, it is a sabbath to the Lord.</i></p><p><i>These are the Lord\u2019s appointed festivals, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times.\u2019\u201d</i></p><p>Here\u2019s a simple way to lay out the sabbath and the appointed festivals.</p><p>1. Sabbath</p><p>The seventh day of each week.</p><p>Duration: one day</p><p>Restrictions: no work</p><p>2.

You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you. However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you, if only you fully obey the Lord your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today.

The Day of Atonement is the next holiday where a symbolic goat takes Israel\u2019s sins out of the camp. The Feast of Tabernacles is last. This feast is meant to reenact the Israelite wandering and journey in the wilderness. Israelites are expected to not work for seven days and camp out.\nTim quotes from Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer.\n\u201cThe Holy One, blessed be He, created seven ages, and of them all He chose the seventh age only, the six ages are for the going in and coming out (of God\u2019s creatures) for war and peace. The seventh age is entirely Sabbath and rest in the life everlasting.\u201d\nThank you to all our supporters! Have a question for us?

They go over the story of the Passover and review how it reflects the creation account in Genesis.</p><p>In part 2 (8:30-22:30), Tim transitions to the story of Israel collecting manna in the wilderness in Exodus 16.</p><p>Exodus 16:4-35</p><p><i>Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cBehold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.\u201d So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, \u201cAt evening you shall know that it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord, because he has heard your grumbling against the Lord. For what are we, that you grumble against us?\u201d And Moses said, \u201cWhen the Lord gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the Lord has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him\u2014what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the Lord.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Then Moses said to Aaron, \u201cSay to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, \u2018Come near before the Lord, for he has heard your grumbling.\u2019\u201d And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cI have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel. Say to them, \u2018At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d</i></p><p><i>In the evening quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp. And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground. When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, \u201cWhat is it? For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, \u201cIt is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat. This is what the Lord has commanded: \u2018Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an omer, according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.\u2019\u201d And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less. But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat. And Moses said to them, \u201cLet no one leave any of it over till the morning.\u201d But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them. Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.</i></p><p><i>On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each. And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, he said to them, \u201cThis is what the Lord has commanded: \u2018Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.\u2019\u201d So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded them, and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it. Moses said, \u201cEat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the field. Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none.\u201d</i></p><p><i>On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cHow long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? See! The Lord has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.\u201d So the people rested on the seventh day.</i></p><p><i>Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. Moses said, \u201cThis is what the Lord has commanded: \u2018Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.\u2019\u201d And Moses said to Aaron, \u201cTake a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the Lord to be kept throughout your generations.\u201d As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan.</i></p><p>Tim notes that manna was supposed to be a little taste of the new creation. Manna was a new work of creation that violated normal creation while also fitting within God\u2019s ideal purpose for creation (i.e., within the seven-day scheme). Manna was a divine gift that came from proximity to the divine glory (Ex 16:9-10). This miraculous provision didn\u2019t behave like normal food, and there was more than enough each day, no matter how much was gathered.</p><p>Tim also shares that the rhythms of gathering and not gathering on the Sabbath is an imitation of God\u2019s own patterns of work and rest in Genesis 1. Similarly, God announced \u201cgood\u201d days one through six and \u201cvery good\u201d on day seven. This parallels with Israel collecting manna on days one through six and \u201cdouble manna\u201d on day seven. Furthermore, on the seventh day God \u201crested\u201d (took up residence in his temple), and on the seventh day Israel \u201crests\u201d and Moses \u201crested\u201d a perpetual sample of manna \u201cbefore Yahweh\u201d and \u201cbefore the testimony.\u201d</p><p>Tim cites scholar Stephen Geller:</p><p>\u201c... manna is presented as a new work of creation that disrupts the established order of creation. In fact, there is a clear parallelism between the creation account in Gen 1-2:4 and Exod 16. In both passages there is a dichotomy between the first six days and the seventh day. In Gen 1, the work of each day is stated by God to be \"good,\" a term that marks its completion. But on the sixth day the phrase \"very good\" marks the completion not just of the acts of creation on that day, but of the first six days as a whole. Genesis 2:1 states explicitly that \"the heaven and earth were completed.\" Yet, to the perplex\u00adity of exegesis, the very next verse says that \"God completed on the seventh day the work he did and ceased on the seventh day all work he did.\" The second of these two statements must be viewed as an explanation of the first: God completed his work by ceasing.\u201d</p><p>(Stephen Geller, \u201cExodus 16: A Literary and Theological Reading,\u201d Interpretation vol. (2005), p. 13.)</p><p>In part 3 (22:30-36:30), the guys dive into the actual Sabbath command as part of the Ten Commandments, which is given in seven Hebrew sentences. The Sabbath command in Exodus 20:8-11 is expressed in seven statements arranged in a chiastic symmetry. Tim says this is another fascinating layer of the theme of seventh-day rest in the Bible.</p><p>Exodus 20:8-11</p><p><i>A \u2013 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</i></p><p><i>B \u2013 Six days you will labor</i></p><p><i>C \u2013 and do all your work,</i></p><p><i>D \u2013 but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God;</i></p><p><i>C\u2019 \u2013 you shall not do any work,</i></p><p><i>you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant,</i></p><p><i>or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you.</i></p><p><i>B\u2019 \u2013 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth,</i></p><p><i>the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day;</i></p><p><i>A\u2019 \u2013 therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.</i></p><p>Tim cites scholar Leigh Trevaskis to make his point:</p><p>\u201cThe sabbatical rest seems to remind Israel of her covenant obligations as YHWH\u2019s new creation. Though this rest is more immediately connected to the exodus in these chapters, it has its roots in the creation story (Gen 2:1-3; cf. Exod 20:11) and by connecting Israel\u2019s remembrance of her redemption from Egypt with the sabbatical rest, the exodus becomes infused with further theological significance: just as Gods seventh day rest in the creation story marks the emergence of his new creation, so does Israel\u2019s sabbatical rest attest to her emergence as YHWH\u2019s new creation through his act of redemption. And since her identity as a new creation is tied up with the covenant (cf. Exod 15:1-19; 19:4-5), Israel\u2019s sabbatical rests\u2026 presumably recall her obligation to remain faithful to this covenant, encouraging her to live according to the Creators will.\u201d (Leigh Trevaskis, \u201cThe Purpose of Leviticus 24 within its Literary Context,\u201d 298-299.)</p><p>Tim then walks through Exodus 24, which is the start of God giving the tabernacle instructions to Moses. This story is a crucial layer to understanding how the building of the tabernacle (the \u201ctent of meeting\u201d) weaves into the theme of seventh-day rest.</p><p>Exodus 24:1-11</p><p><i>Then he said to Moses, \u201cCome up to the Lord, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from afar. Moses alone shall come near to the Lord, but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not come up with him.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the rules. And all the people answered with one voice and said, \u201cAll the words that the Lord has spoken we will do.\u201d And Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord. He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. And he sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord.

They go over the story of the Passover and review how it reflects the creation account in Genesis.</p><p>In part 2 (8:30-22:30), Tim transitions to the story of Israel collecting manna in the wilderness in Exodus 16.</p><p>Exodus 16:4-35</p><p><i>Then the Lord said to Moses, \u201cBehold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.\u201d So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, \u201cAt evening you shall know that it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord, because he has heard your grumbling against the Lord. For what are we, that you grumble against us?\u201d And Moses said, \u201cWhen the Lord gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the Lord has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him\u2014what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the Lord.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Then Moses said to Aaron, \u201cSay to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, \u2018Come near before the Lord, for he has heard your grumbling.\u2019\u201d And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cI have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel. Say to them, \u2018At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d</i></p><p><i>In the evening quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp. And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground. When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, \u201cWhat is it? For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, \u201cIt is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat. This is what the Lord has commanded: \u2018Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an omer, according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.\u2019\u201d And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less. But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat. And Moses said to them, \u201cLet no one leave any of it over till the morning.\u201d But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them. Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.</i></p><p><i>On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each. And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, he said to them, \u201cThis is what the Lord has commanded: \u2018Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.\u2019\u201d So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded them, and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it. Moses said, \u201cEat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the field. Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none.\u201d</i></p><p><i>On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cHow long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? See! The Lord has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.\u201d So the people rested on the seventh day.</i></p><p><i>Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. Moses said, \u201cThis is what the Lord has commanded: \u2018Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.\u2019\u201d And Moses said to Aaron, \u201cTake a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the Lord to be kept throughout your generations.\u201d As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan.</i></p><p>Tim notes that manna was supposed to be a little taste of the new creation. Manna was a new work of creation that violated normal creation while also fitting within God\u2019s ideal purpose for creation (i.e., within the seven-day scheme). Manna was a divine gift that came from proximity to the divine glory (Ex 16:9-10). This miraculous provision didn\u2019t behave like normal food, and there was more than enough each day, no matter how much was gathered.</p><p>Tim also shares that the rhythms of gathering and not gathering on the Sabbath is an imitation of God\u2019s own patterns of work and rest in Genesis 1. Similarly, God announced \u201cgood\u201d days one through six and \u201cvery good\u201d on day seven. This parallels with Israel collecting manna on days one through six and \u201cdouble manna\u201d on day seven. Furthermore, on the seventh day God \u201crested\u201d (took up residence in his temple), and on the seventh day Israel \u201crests\u201d and Moses \u201crested\u201d a perpetual sample of manna \u201cbefore Yahweh\u201d and \u201cbefore the testimony.\u201d</p><p>Tim cites scholar Stephen Geller:</p><p>\u201c... manna is presented as a new work of creation that disrupts the established order of creation. In fact, there is a clear parallelism between the creation account in Gen 1-2:4 and Exod 16. In both passages there is a dichotomy between the first six days and the seventh day. In Gen 1, the work of each day is stated by God to be \"good,\" a term that marks its completion. But on the sixth day the phrase \"very good\" marks the completion not just of the acts of creation on that day, but of the first six days as a whole. Genesis 2:1 states explicitly that \"the heaven and earth were completed.\" Yet, to the perplex\u00adity of exegesis, the very next verse says that \"God completed on the seventh day the work he did and ceased on the seventh day all work he did.\" The second of these two statements must be viewed as an explanation of the first: God completed his work by ceasing.\u201d</p><p>(Stephen Geller, \u201cExodus 16: A Literary and Theological Reading,\u201d Interpretation vol. (2005), p. 13.)</p><p>In part 3 (22:30-36:30), the guys dive into the actual Sabbath command as part of the Ten Commandments, which is given in seven Hebrew sentences. The Sabbath command in Exodus 20:8-11 is expressed in seven statements arranged in a chiastic symmetry. Tim says this is another fascinating layer of the theme of seventh-day rest in the Bible.</p><p>Exodus 20:8-11</p><p><i>A \u2013 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</i></p><p><i>B \u2013 Six days you will labor</i></p><p><i>C \u2013 and do all your work,</i></p><p><i>D \u2013 but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God;</i></p><p><i>C\u2019 \u2013 you shall not do any work,</i></p><p><i>you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant,</i></p><p><i>or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you.</i></p><p><i>B\u2019 \u2013 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth,</i></p><p><i>the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day;</i></p><p><i>A\u2019 \u2013 therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.</i></p><p>Tim cites scholar Leigh Trevaskis to make his point:</p><p>\u201cThe sabbatical rest seems to remind Israel of her covenant obligations as YHWH\u2019s new creation. Though this rest is more immediately connected to the exodus in these chapters, it has its roots in the creation story (Gen 2:1-3; cf. Exod 20:11) and by connecting Israel\u2019s remembrance of her redemption from Egypt with the sabbatical rest, the exodus becomes infused with further theological significance: just as Gods seventh day rest in the creation story marks the emergence of his new creation, so does Israel\u2019s sabbatical rest attest to her emergence as YHWH\u2019s new creation through his act of redemption. And since her identity as a new creation is tied up with the covenant (cf. Exod 15:1-19; 19:4-5), Israel\u2019s sabbatical rests\u2026 presumably recall her obligation to remain faithful to this covenant, encouraging her to live according to the Creators will.\u201d (Leigh Trevaskis, \u201cThe Purpose of Leviticus 24 within its Literary Context,\u201d 298-299.)</p><p>Tim then walks through Exodus 24, which is the start of God giving the tabernacle instructions to Moses. This story is a crucial layer to understanding how the building of the tabernacle (the \u201ctent of meeting\u201d) weaves into the theme of seventh-day rest.</p><p>Exodus 24:1-11</p><p><i>Then he said to Moses, \u201cCome up to the Lord, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from afar. Moses alone shall come near to the Lord, but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not come up with him.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the rules. And all the people answered with one voice and said, \u201cAll the words that the Lord has spoken we will do.\u201d And Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord. He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. And he sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord. And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he threw against the altar. Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, \u201cAll that the Lord has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.\u201d And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said, \u201cBehold the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, and they saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness. And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; they beheld God, and ate and drank.</i></p><p>In part 4 (36:30-49:50), Tim continues the story in Exodus 24.</p><p>Exodus 24:12-18</p><p><i>The Lord said to Moses, \u201cCome up to me on the mountain and wait there, that I may give you the tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction.\u201d So Moses rose with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God.

They go over the story of the Passover and review how it reflects the creation account in Genesis.\nIn part 2 (8:30-22:30), Tim transitions to the story of Israel collecting manna in the wilderness in Exodus 16.\nExodus 16:4-35\nThen the Lord said to Moses, \u201cBehold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.\u201d So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, \u201cAt evening you shall know that it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord, because he has heard your grumbling against the Lord. For what are we, that you grumble against us?\u201d And Moses said, \u201cWhen the Lord gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the Lord has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him\u2014what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the Lord.\u201d\nThen Moses said to Aaron, \u201cSay to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, \u2018Come near before the Lord, for he has heard your grumbling.\u2019\u201d And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cI have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel. Say to them, \u2018At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d\nIn the evening quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp. And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground. When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, \u201cWhat is it? For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, \u201cIt is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat. This is what the Lord has commanded: \u2018Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an omer, according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.\u2019\u201d And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less. But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat. And Moses said to them, \u201cLet no one leave any of it over till the morning.\u201d But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them. Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.\nOn the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each. And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, he said to them, \u201cThis is what the Lord has commanded: \u2018Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.\u2019\u201d So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded them, and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it. Moses said, \u201cEat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the field. Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none.\u201d\nOn the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cHow long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? See! The Lord has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.\u201d So the people rested on the seventh day.\nNow the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. Moses said, \u201cThis is what the Lord has commanded: \u2018Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.\u2019\u201d And Moses said to Aaron, \u201cTake a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the Lord to be kept throughout your generations.\u201d As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan.\nTim notes that manna was supposed to be a little taste of the new creation. Manna was a new work of creation that violated normal creation while also fitting within God\u2019s ideal purpose for creation (i.e., within the seven-day scheme). Manna was a divine gift that came from proximity to the divine glory (Ex 16:9-10). This miraculous provision didn\u2019t behave like normal food, and there was more than enough each day, no matter how much was gathered.\nTim also shares that the rhythms of gathering and not gathering on the Sabbath is an imitation of God\u2019s own patterns of work and rest in Genesis 1. Similarly, God announced \u201cgood\u201d days one through six and \u201cvery good\u201d on day seven. This parallels with Israel collecting manna on days one through six and \u201cdouble manna\u201d on day seven. Furthermore, on the seventh day God \u201crested\u201d (took up residence in his temple), and on the seventh day Israel \u201crests\u201d and Moses \u201crested\u201d a perpetual sample of manna \u201cbefore Yahweh\u201d and \u201cbefore the testimony.\u201d\nTim cites scholar Stephen Geller:\n\u201c... manna is presented as a new work of creation that disrupts the established order of creation. In fact, there is a clear parallelism between the creation account in Gen 1-2:4 and Exod 16. In both passages there is a dichotomy between the first six days and the seventh day. In Gen 1, the work of each day is stated by God to be \"good,\" a term that marks its completion. But on the sixth day the phrase \"very good\" marks the completion not just of the acts of creation on that day, but of the first six days as a whole. Genesis 2:1 states explicitly that \"the heaven and earth were completed.\" Yet, to the perplex\u00adity of exegesis, the very next verse says that \"God completed on the seventh day the work he did and ceased on the seventh day all work he did.\" The second of these two statements must be viewed as an explanation of the first: God completed his work by ceasing.\u201d\n(Stephen Geller, \u201cExodus 16: A Literary and Theological Reading,\u201d Interpretation vol. (2005), p. 13.)\nIn part 3 (22:30-36:30), the guys dive into the actual Sabbath command as part of the Ten Commandments, which is given in seven Hebrew sentences. The Sabbath command in Exodus 20:8-11 is expressed in seven statements arranged in a chiastic symmetry. Tim says this is another fascinating layer of the theme of seventh-day rest in the Bible.\nExodus 20:8-11\nA \u2013 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\nB \u2013 Six days you will labor\nC \u2013 and do all your work,\nD \u2013 but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God;\nC\u2019 \u2013 you shall not do any work,\nyou or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant,\nor your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you.\nB\u2019 \u2013 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth,\nthe sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day;\nA\u2019 \u2013 therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.\nTim cites scholar Leigh Trevaskis to make his point:\n\u201cThe sabbatical rest seems to remind Israel of her covenant obligations as YHWH\u2019s new creation. Though this rest is more immediately connected to the exodus in these chapters, it has its roots in the creation story (Gen 2:1-3; cf. Exod 20:11) and by connecting Israel\u2019s remembrance of her redemption from Egypt with the sabbatical rest, the exodus becomes infused with further theological significance: just as Gods seventh day rest in the creation story marks the emergence of his new creation, so does Israel\u2019s sabbatical rest attest to her emergence as YHWH\u2019s new creation through his act of redemption. And since her identity as a new creation is tied up with the covenant (cf. Exod 15:1-19; 19:4-5), Israel\u2019s sabbatical rests\u2026 presumably recall her obligation to remain faithful to this covenant, encouraging her to live according to the Creators will.\u201d (Leigh Trevaskis, \u201cThe Purpose of Leviticus 24 within its Literary Context,\u201d 298-299.)\nTim then walks through Exodus 24, which is the start of God giving the tabernacle instructions to Moses. This story is a crucial layer to understanding how the building of the tabernacle (the \u201ctent of meeting\u201d) weaves into the theme of seventh-day rest.\nExodus 24:1-11\nThen he said to Moses, \u201cCome up to the Lord, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from afar. Moses alone shall come near to the Lord, but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not come up with him.\u201d\nMoses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the rules. And all the people answered with one voice and said, \u201cAll the words that the Lord has spoken we will do.\u201d And Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord. He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. And he sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord. And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he threw against the altar. Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, \u201cAll that the Lord has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.\u201d And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said, \u201cBehold the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words.\u201d\nThen Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, and they saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness. And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; they beheld God, and ate and drank.\nIn part 4 (36:30-49:50), Tim continues the story in Exodus 24.\nExodus 24:12-18\nThe Lord said to Moses, \u201cCome up to me on the mountain and wait there, that I may give you the tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction.\u201d So Moses rose with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God. And he said to the elders, \u201cWait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever has a dispute, let him go to them.\u201d Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. The glory of the Lord dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. Now the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel. Moses entered the cloud and went up on the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.\nTim notes that the theme of sixth and seventh day is now clearly established. God appears to Moses on the seventh day.\nHere in Exodus 25-31, God presents Moses with the plans for the tabernacle. These plans are dispensed in seven speeches by God.\n[1] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 25:1]\n[2] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 30:11]\n[3] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 30:17]\n[4] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 30:22]\n[5] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 30:34]\n[6] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 31:1]\n[7] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 31:12]\nThe seventh and final act of speech covers the Sabbath.\nAfter this, in Exodus 40, the completion of the tabernacle is given with seven statements of Moses completing the work God commanded him.\nExodus 40:17-18a\nAnd it came about in the beginning month, in the second year, on the first of the month, the tabernacle was set up (\u05d4\u05d5\u05e7\u05dd), and Moses set up (\u05d5\u05ea\u05e7\u05dd) the tabernacle\u2026\n[1] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:19]\n[2] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:21]\n[3] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:23]\n[4] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:25]\n[5] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:27]\n[6] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:29]\n[7] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:32]\n\u201cAnd Moses completed (\u05d5\u05d9\u05db\u05dc) the work (\u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d4)\u201d [Exodus 40:33b]\nTim cites scholar Howard Wallace to make the following point:\n\u201cThe structuring of the narrative in Exodus 25-40 binds the Sabbath observance closely with the construction of the sanctuary. Both are tightly connected with the question of the presence of Yahweh with his people\u2026. The Sabbath is a significant element in the celebration of the presence of Yahweh with his people. Just as the tabernacle was built along lines specified by divine decree, so too in the sequence is the human sabbath institution modeled on the divine pattern. Since the tabernacle, which is patterned on the divine plan, reveals the presence and shares in the role of the heavenly temple to proclaim the sovereignty of Israel\u2019s God, so the Sabbath shares in the proclamation of the sovereignty of Yahweh.\u201d\n(Howard Wallace, \u201cCreation and Sabbath in Genesis 2:1-3,\u201d 246.)\nTim also shares a quote from Rabbi Abraham Heschel.\n\u201cThe sabbath is to time what the temple and tabernacle are to space. The sabbath is a cathedral in time. On the seventh day we experience in time what the tabernacle and temple represented as spaces which is eternal life, God in the complete creation.\u201d\n(The Sabbath, Abraham Joshua Heschel)\nIn part 5 (49:50-end), the guys finish up their conversation. Tim notes that the cliffhanger at the end of Exodus is that Moses and all of Israel have successfully built the tabernacle (or the tent of meeting) and God then comes to dwell in it, to meet with Israel. But when he does, his presence is too intense, and Moses is unable to go in. So what will happen?

And he said to the elders, \u201cWait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever has a dispute, let him go to them.\u201d Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. The glory of the Lord dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. Now the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel. Moses entered the cloud and went up on the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.\nTim notes that the theme of sixth and seventh day is now clearly established. God appears to Moses on the seventh day.\nHere in Exodus 25-31, God presents Moses with the plans for the tabernacle. These plans are dispensed in seven speeches by God.\n[1] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 25:1]\n[2] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 30:11]\n[3] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 30:17]\n[4] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 30:22]\n[5] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 30:34]\n[6] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 31:1]\n[7] \u201cAnd YHWH spoke to Moses, saying\u2026\u201d [Exodus 31:12]\nThe seventh and final act of speech covers the Sabbath.\nAfter this, in Exodus 40, the completion of the tabernacle is given with seven statements of Moses completing the work God commanded him.\nExodus 40:17-18a\nAnd it came about in the beginning month, in the second year, on the first of the month, the tabernacle was set up (\u05d4\u05d5\u05e7\u05dd), and Moses set up (\u05d5\u05ea\u05e7\u05dd) the tabernacle\u2026\n[1] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:19]\n[2] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:21]\n[3] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:23]\n[4] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:25]\n[5] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:27]\n[6] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:29]\n[7] \u201c\u2026just as Yahweh commanded Moses\u201d [Exodus 40:32]\n\u201cAnd Moses completed (\u05d5\u05d9\u05db\u05dc) the work (\u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d4)\u201d [Exodus 40:33b]\nTim cites scholar Howard Wallace to make the following point:\n\u201cThe structuring of the narrative in Exodus 25-40 binds the Sabbath observance closely with the construction of the sanctuary. Both are tightly connected with the question of the presence of Yahweh with his people\u2026. The Sabbath is a significant element in the celebration of the presence of Yahweh with his people. Just as the tabernacle was built along lines specified by divine decree, so too in the sequence is the human sabbath institution modeled on the divine pattern. Since the tabernacle, which is patterned on the divine plan, reveals the presence and shares in the role of the heavenly temple to proclaim the sovereignty of Israel\u2019s God, so the Sabbath shares in the proclamation of the sovereignty of Yahweh.\u201d\n(Howard Wallace, \u201cCreation and Sabbath in Genesis 2:1-3,\u201d 246.)\nTim also shares a quote from Rabbi Abraham Heschel.\n\u201cThe sabbath is to time what the temple and tabernacle are to space. The sabbath is a cathedral in time. On the seventh day we experience in time what the tabernacle and temple represented as spaces which is eternal life, God in the complete creation.\u201d\n(The Sabbath, Abraham Joshua Heschel)\nIn part 5 (49:50-end), the guys finish up their conversation. Tim notes that the cliffhanger at the end of Exodus is that Moses and all of Israel have successfully built the tabernacle (or the tent of meeting) and God then comes to dwell in it, to meet with Israel. But when he does, his presence is too intense, and Moses is unable to go in. So what will happen? Find out next week when we turn to Numbers and Leviticus.\nThank you to all our supporters!\n\u00a0\nShow Resources:\n\nHoward Wallace, \u201cCreation and Sabbath in Genesis 2:1-3\u201d\nAbraham Joshua Heschel, The Sabbath\nLeigh Trevaskis, \u201cThe Purpose of Leviticus 24 within its Literary Context\u201d\nStephen Geller, \u201cExodus 16: A Literary and Theological Reading\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nFind all our resources at www.thebibleproject.com\nShow Music:\n\nThe Hymn of the Cherubim by Tchaikovsky\nNature by KV\nFeather by Waywell\nSolace by Nomyn\n\n\u00a0\nShow Produced by:\nDan Gummel\n\u00a0\nPowered and distributed by Simplecast.",

The powers of evil destroy Israel (i.e. new humanity) through slavery (lit. \u201cworking\u201d in Hebrew, \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d4), and through the waters of death. But God acts and rescues Israel.

It\u2019s at night that God parts the waters (Exod 14:21), and during the last watch of the night (Exod 14:24), the Egyptians falter in the midst of the sea, and at sunrise (Exod 14:27) the waters destroy the Egyptians while the Israelites flourish on dry land.</p><p>Tim says that this story maps directly onto the creation narrative. The passage through the Reed Sea is all days 1-3 together in Genesis.</p><p>In part 6 (56:20-end), Tim goes to Exodus 15 to discuss the first \u201cworship song\u201d in the Bible.</p><p>Exodus 15:10-13, 17-18</p><p>\u2028<i>You blew with your wind, the sea covered them;\u2028</i></p><p><i>They sank like lead in the mighty waters.\u2028</i></p><p><i>Who is like you among the gods, O Lord?\u2028</i></p><p><i>Who is like you, majestic in holiness,\u2028</i></p><p><i>Awesome in praises, working wonders?</i></p><p><i>\u2028You stretched out your right hand,\u2028</i></p><p><i>The earth swallowed them.</i></p><p><i>\u2028In your lovingkindness you have led the people whom you have redeemed;\u2028</i></p><p><i>In your strength you have guided them to your holy habitation.</i></p><p><i>You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,\u2028</i></p><p><i>The place of your dwelling </i>(\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05da<i> / shibteka / </i>Sabbath!)<i>, which you have made,\u2028</i></p><p><i>The sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have established.\u2028</i></p><p><i>The Lord shall reign forever and ever.</i></p><p>Tim notes that the English word \u201cdwelling\u201d in verse 17 is a wordplay on the word \u201csabbath,\u201d because it is composed of the same letters.</p><p>Tim then discusses more details about the Passover and why its importance in the Bible. The Passover is on the 14th (2 x 7) and is followed by a seven day festival of unleavened bread (15th \u2013 21st), that begins and ends with a \u201csuper sabbath\u201d rest.</p><p>In Exodus 12:1-2, the new beginning given by God as he says, \u201cbeginning of the months, the beginning it is for you,\u201d parallels with Genesis 1:1, \u201cIn the beginning\u2026.\u201d Passover is compared to creation as a seven-day ritual the restarts the calendar, like a new creation.</p><p>Tim then dives back into Exodus 12:14-16, 34, 39.</p><p><i>Now this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the Lord; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses; for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel. On the first day you shall have a holy assembly, and another holy assembly on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them, except what must be eaten by every person, that alone may be prepared by you.</i></p><p><i>So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in the clothes on their shoulders.</i></p><p><i>They baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread. For it had not become leavened, since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.</i></p><p>Tim makes the following observations:</p><ul><li>12:15 \u2013 \u201cFor seven days you are to put to rest (\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5) all leaven (\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8) from your houses.\u201d For the resonance of \u201cleaven\u201d \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 with \u201cremnant\u201d \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8, continue reading for the comparison of Passover and the flood.</li><li>12:16 \u2013 \u201con the first day it is a holy convocation, and on the seventh day it is a holy convocation\u2026 all work should not be done on them.\u201d This parallels Genesis 2:1-4. The seventh day is holy, for God finished his work.</li><li>13:6-7 \u2013 \u201cSeven days you will eat unleavened bread (\u05de\u05e6\u05ea) and on the seventh day it is a feast for YHWH; unleavened bread will be eaten (\u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc) for seven days, and leaven will not be seen for you for seven days.\u201d This parallels with Genesis 1-3: There is a certain food provided (\u05de\u05df \u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05e2\u05da), and a certain food that is forbidden (the tree of knowing good and bad).</li></ul><p>Here's a quote Tim cites in his notes for this verse:\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut why require eating unleavened bread as the special focus of the exodus memorial meal, the Passover? The answer is that unleavened bread was the unique food of the original exodus, the event God wanted his people to be sure not to forget. People everywhere normally eat leavened bread. It tastes better, is more pleasant to eat, is more filling. Leavened bread was the normal choice of the Israelites in Egypt too. But on the night they ran, there was no time for the usual niceties\u2014a fast meal had to be eaten, and hastily made bread had to be consumed. The fact that a lamb or goat kid was roasted for the meat portion of the meal or that bitter herbs were eaten as a side dish was not nearly so special or unusual as the fact that the bread was unleavened, thus essentially forming sheets of cracker. Eating it at the memorial feast intentionally recalled the original departure in haste. Eating it for a solid week tended to fix the idea in one\u2019s consciousness.\u201d (Douglas K. Stuart, <i>Exodus, vol. 2, The New American Commentary</i>, 283)</p><p>Consider these points:</p><ul><li>Passover is coordinated with the \u201cwonder\u201d of the parting of the waters and deliverance onto dry land (Exod 14), which parallels Genesis 1 when God parts the waters so that dry land can emerge.</li><li>Passover is about Israel\u2019s liberation from \u201cslavery\u201d (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d4/\u05e2\u05d1\u05f3\u05f3\u05d3), which parallels Genesis 1-2 about the creation of humanity as God\u2019s co-rulers who \u201cwork\u201d (\u05e2\u05d1\u05f3\u05f3\u05d3) the land.</li><li>Passover is a reversal of humanity\u2019s exile when Israel is \u201cbanished\u201d (\u05d2\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5, Ex 12:39) from Egypt, which parallels Genesis 3:22-24 when humanity is banished from Eden into the wilderness.</li></ul><p>Tim concludes by saying that Passover and the Exodus are a kind of \u201cnew creation\u201d as enslaved humanity is liberated from the realm of exile, death, and darkness and led through the waters of death into the new Eden of the promised land, marked by the celebration of a seven-day ritual (in the month of Abib on the 14th-21st). The liberation brought about at Passover is a new creation. The liberation requires that humans not try to provide their own security or provision (bread) but eat only what God allows and provides. This is clearly in preparation for the manna.</p><p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p><p>Have a question? Record your question and send it to info@jointhebibleproject.com.

So the whole sacred calendar of Israel that you\u2019ll meet in Exodus and Leviticus is already baked into the story at the beginning of Genesis. (This is) sacred time.\"\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nThe Jewish sacred feasts are an integral and overlooked theme in the Bible. They are built into the fabric of the original creation story in Genesis 1:14.\nPassover is considered to be the most important Jewish holiday. Many biblical themes flow into and out of the idea of the Passover.\n\nSHOW NOTES\nWelcome to our fourth episode discussing the theme of the seventh-day rest in the Bible. In this episode, Tim and Jon look at the Passover and Exodus stories and talk about their importance to the development of this theme.\nIn part 1 (0-12:30), the guys quickly go over the conversation so far. Tim briefly covers the days of creation and notes how God sets up structures of time on days one, four, and seven. These structures are reflected in the Hebrew calendar.\nIn part 2 (12:30-19:30), Tim begins to share broadly about the Hebrew sacred calendar. Tim notes that the Jewish calendar is designed to heavily reflect symbolic \u201cseven\u201d imagery.\nIn part 3 (19:30-37:30), Tim briefly recaps the calling of Abraham that was discussed in the previous episode. Tim notes that Abraham believed that God would bring about an ultimate seventh day. A brief conversation follows about fasting in Christianity as well as a brief discussion on the differences between \u201chope\u201d and \u201coptimism.\u201d Tim cites scholar Cornel West about the differences between optimism and Christian hope.\nIn part 4 (37:30-43:00), Tim starts to talk about Passover, which originates in the book of Exodus. Tim says that Passover is the most important feast on the Jewish calendar. The Exodus story is presented in cosmic terms on analogy with the Creation story of Genesis 1.\nIn part 5 (43:00-56:20), Tim explains the story of the Exodus and how it maps onto the Genesis story. The powers of evil destroy Israel (i.e. new humanity) through slavery (lit. \u201cworking\u201d in Hebrew, \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d4), and through the waters of death. But God acts and rescues Israel. The famous story of the ten plagues are inversions of the ten creative words of God in Genesis 1. All of the plagues \u201cde-create\u201d Egypt back into chaotic darkness.\nConsider these examples:\nThe Plague of Darkness\u2028\nGenesis 1:2-3\u00a0\n\u2026and darkness (\u05d7\u05e9\u05da) was over the surface of the deep\u2026. Then God said, \u201clet there be light (\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8)\u2026.\u201d\nExodus 10:21, 23\u00a0\n\u2026that there may be darkness (\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d7\u05e9\u05da) over the land of Egypt\u2026 but for all the sons of Israel, there was light (\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8) in their dwellings.\nThe Plague of Frogs\nExodus 7:28\nAnd the Nile will swarm (\u05d5\u05e9\u05e8\u05e5) with frogs\u2026\nGenesis 1:20\u00a0\n\u2026let the waters swarm (\u05e9\u05e8\u05e5) with every swarming (\u05e9\u05e8\u05e5) creature\u2026\nThe Plague of Locusts\nExodus 10:5\u00a0\n[the locusts] will eat every tree (\u05e2\u05e5) which sprouts (\u05e6\u05de\u05d7) for you from the field (\u05d4\u05e9\u05d3\u05d4).\nExodus 10:15\u00a0\n\u2026fruit of the tree\u2026all vegetation in the tree and green thing (\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7) in the field\u2026\nGenesis 1:29-30\u00a0\nI have given to you for food all vegetation\u2026 all the tree which has the fruit of the tree\u2026 every green thing (\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7)\u2026.\nGenesis 2:9\u00a0\n\u2026and Yahweh sprouted (\u05e6\u05de\u05d7) from the ground every tree (\u05e2\u05e5)\u2026\n\u2028Pharaoh sends Israel out of Egypt at night (Exod 12:29, 31, 42) and Israel flees to the edge of the Reed Sea where Pharaoh\u2019s army chases them for a night showdown (Exod 14:20). It\u2019s at night that God parts the waters (Exod 14:21), and during the last watch of the night (Exod 14:24), the Egyptians falter in the midst of the sea, and at sunrise (Exod 14:27) the waters destroy the Egyptians while the Israelites flourish on dry land.\nTim says that this story maps directly onto the creation narrative. The passage through the Reed Sea is all days 1-3 together in Genesis.\nIn part 6 (56:20-end), Tim goes to Exodus 15 to discuss the first \u201cworship song\u201d in the Bible.\nExodus 15:10-13, 17-18\n\u2028You blew with your wind, the sea covered them;\u2028\nThey sank like lead in the mighty waters.\u2028\nWho is like you among the gods, O Lord?\u2028\nWho is like you, majestic in holiness,\u2028\nAwesome in praises, working wonders?\n\u2028You stretched out your right hand,\u2028\nThe earth swallowed them.\n\u2028In your lovingkindness you have led the people whom you have redeemed;\u2028\nIn your strength you have guided them to your holy habitation.\nYou will bring them and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,\u2028\nThe place of your dwelling (\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05da / shibteka / Sabbath!), which you have made,\u2028\nThe sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have established.\u2028\nThe Lord shall reign forever and ever.\nTim notes that the English word \u201cdwelling\u201d in verse 17 is a wordplay on the word \u201csabbath,\u201d because it is composed of the same letters.\nTim then discusses more details about the Passover and why its importance in the Bible. The Passover is on the 14th (2 x 7) and is followed by a seven day festival of unleavened bread (15th \u2013 21st), that begins and ends with a \u201csuper sabbath\u201d rest.\nIn Exodus 12:1-2, the new beginning given by God as he says, \u201cbeginning of the months, the beginning it is for you,\u201d parallels with Genesis 1:1, \u201cIn the beginning\u2026.\u201d Passover is compared to creation as a seven-day ritual the restarts the calendar, like a new creation.\nTim then dives back into Exodus 12:14-16, 34, 39.\nNow this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the Lord; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses; for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel. On the first day you shall have a holy assembly, and another holy assembly on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them, except what must be eaten by every person, that alone may be prepared by you.\nSo the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in the clothes on their shoulders.\nThey baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread. For it had not become leavened, since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.\nTim makes the following observations:\n\n12:15 \u2013 \u201cFor seven days you are to put to rest (\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5) all leaven (\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8) from your houses.\u201d For the resonance of \u201cleaven\u201d \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 with \u201cremnant\u201d \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8, continue reading for the comparison of Passover and the flood.\n12:16 \u2013 \u201con the first day it is a holy convocation, and on the seventh day it is a holy convocation\u2026 all work should not be done on them.\u201d This parallels Genesis 2:1-4. The seventh day is holy, for God finished his work.\n13:6-7 \u2013 \u201cSeven days you will eat unleavened bread (\u05de\u05e6\u05ea) and on the seventh day it is a feast for YHWH; unleavened bread will be eaten (\u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc) for seven days, and leaven will not be seen for you for seven days.\u201d This parallels with Genesis 1-3: There is a certain food provided (\u05de\u05df \u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05e2\u05da), and a certain food that is forbidden (the tree of knowing good and bad).\n\nHere's a quote Tim cites in his notes for this verse:\u00a0\n\u201cBut why require eating unleavened bread as the special focus of the exodus memorial meal, the Passover? The answer is that unleavened bread was the unique food of the original exodus, the event God wanted his people to be sure not to forget. People everywhere normally eat leavened bread. It tastes better, is more pleasant to eat, is more filling. Leavened bread was the normal choice of the Israelites in Egypt too. But on the night they ran, there was no time for the usual niceties\u2014a fast meal had to be eaten, and hastily made bread had to be consumed. The fact that a lamb or goat kid was roasted for the meat portion of the meal or that bitter herbs were eaten as a side dish was not nearly so special or unusual as the fact that the bread was unleavened, thus essentially forming sheets of cracker.

Stuart, Exodus, vol. 2, The New American Commentary, 283)\nConsider these points:\n\nPassover is coordinated with the \u201cwonder\u201d of the parting of the waters and deliverance onto dry land (Exod 14), which parallels Genesis 1 when God parts the waters so that dry land can emerge.\nPassover is about Israel\u2019s liberation from \u201cslavery\u201d (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d4/\u05e2\u05d1\u05f3\u05f3\u05d3), which parallels Genesis 1-2 about the creation of humanity as God\u2019s co-rulers who \u201cwork\u201d (\u05e2\u05d1\u05f3\u05f3\u05d3) the land.\nPassover is a reversal of humanity\u2019s exile when Israel is \u201cbanished\u201d (\u05d2\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5, Ex 12:39) from Egypt, which parallels Genesis 3:22-24 when humanity is banished from Eden into the wilderness.\n\nTim concludes by saying that Passover and the Exodus are a kind of \u201cnew creation\u201d as enslaved humanity is liberated from the realm of exile, death, and darkness and led through the waters of death into the new Eden of the promised land, marked by the celebration of a seven-day ritual (in the month of Abib on the 14th-21st). The liberation brought about at Passover is a new creation. The liberation requires that humans not try to provide their own security or provision (bread) but eat only what God allows and provides. This is clearly in preparation for the manna.\nThank you to all our supporters!\nHave a question? Record your question and send it to info@jointhebibleproject.com.

Humanity was meant to be fully present and abide in the garden that God created.</li></ul><p><strong>SHOW NOTES</strong></p><p>Welcome to episode three in our series on the theme of the seventh-day rest in the Bible.</p><p>In part 1 (0-21:45), Tim comments on Genesis 2:15.</p><p>Genesis 2:15</p><p><i>Then the Lord God took the human and \u2018rested him\u2019 </i>(\u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05d7\u05d4\u05d5<i> / nuakh</i>)<i> into the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.</i></p><p>God \u201crests\u201d the human in the garden so that he can \u201cwork\u201d it. Tim notes that this is the first appearance of the Hebrew word <i>nuakh</i> in the Bible. This becomes an important word in the theme of seventh-day rest. Tim says that this word can be understood as \u201cto dwell,\u201d or \u201cto abide and rest in.\u201d Humanity is to be fully present in the garden (Heb. <i>nuakh</i> = \u201cto take up residence\u201d).</p><p>Tim also says that this abiding rest is conditional. Will humans obey God and not take of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad? Answer: no. So what happens? Humanity rebels and is exiled from the heaven and earth Eden mountain, sent to \u201cwork/labor\u201d the ground.</p><p>Genesis 3:17-19</p><p><i>Cursed is the ground because of you;</i></p><p><i>through painful toil you will eat food from it</i></p><p><i>all the days of your life.</i></p><p><i>It will produce thorns and thistles for you,</i></p><p><i>and you will eat the plants of the field.</i></p><p><i>By the sweat of your brow</i></p><p><i>you will eat your food</i></p><p><i>until you return to the ground,</i></p><p><i>since from it you were taken;</i></p><p><i>for dust you are</i></p><p><i>and to dust you will return.</i></p><p>Tim says that this is a change in the nature of our work. The work is no longer enjoyable by default; instead, work becomes a task done for survival.</p><p>In part 2 (21:45-33:20), Jon asks how this idea fits with God\u2019s call for humanity to tend and maintain the garden. Wouldn\u2019t ruling and subduing creation take work?</p><p>Tim responds by talking about two different types of work. Humanity was created to work, but the original work they were destined for was fundamentally different from the post-fall, post-eden work. Tim quotes from Abraham Joshua Heschel, a famous 20th century Jewish rabbi and his book The Sabbath.</p><p>\u201cWe are all infatuated with the splendor of space and the grandeur of the things of space. Thing is a category that lays heavy on our mind, tyrannizing all our thoughts. In our daily lives we attend primarily to that which are senses are spelling out for us. Reality to us is thinghood, consisting of substances that occupy space. Even God is perceived by most of us as a thing. The result of our thinginess is a blindness to all realities that fail to identify itself as a thing. This is obvious in our understanding of time, which being thingless and unsubstantial appears to us as having no reality. Indeed we know what to do with space but do not know what to do with time, except to make it subservient to space. Most of us seem to labor for the sake of things of space.

Tim quotes from Abraham Joshua Heschel, a famous 20th century Jewish rabbi and his book The Sabbath.\n\u201cWe are all infatuated with the splendor of space and the grandeur of the things of space. Thing is a category that lays heavy on our mind, tyrannizing all our thoughts. In our daily lives we attend primarily to that which are senses are spelling out for us. Reality to us is thinghood, consisting of substances that occupy space. Even God is perceived by most of us as a thing. The result of our thinginess is a blindness to all realities that fail to identify itself as a thing. This is obvious in our understanding of time, which being thingless and unsubstantial appears to us as having no reality. Indeed we know what to do with space but do not know what to do with time, except to make it subservient to space. Most of us seem to labor for the sake of things of space. As a result we suffer from a deeply rooted dread of time and stand aghast when compelled to look into its face. Time to us is sarcasm. A slick treacherous monster with a jaw like a furnace incinerating every moment of our lives. Shrinking therefore from facing time, we escape for shelter to things of space.\u201d (Abraham Joshua Heschel, The Sabbath, prologue)\nIn part 3 (33:20-40:45), Tim focuses on Psalm 90.\nLord, you have been our dwelling place\nin all generations.\nBefore the mountains were brought forth,\nor ever you had formed the earth and the world,\nfrom everlasting to everlasting you are God.\nYou return man to dust\nand say, \u201cReturn, O children of man!\u201d\nFor a thousand years in your sight\nare but as yesterday when it is past,\nor as a watch in the night.\nYou sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream,\nlike grass that is renewed in the morning:\nin the morning it flourishes and is renewed;\nin the evening it fades and withers.\nFor we are brought to an end by your anger;\nby your wrath we are dismayed.\nYou have set our iniquities before you,\nour secret sins in the light of your presence.\nFor all our days pass away under your wrath;\nwe bring our years to an end like a sigh.\nThe years of our life are seventy,\nor even by reason of strength eighty;\nyet their span is but toil and trouble;\nthey are soon gone, and we fly away.\nWho considers the power of your anger,\nand your wrath according to the fear of you?\nSo teach us to number our days\nthat we may get a heart of wisdom.\nReturn, O Lord! How long?\nHave pity on your servants!\nSatisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love,\nthat we may rejoice and be glad all our days.\nMake us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,\nand for as many years as we have seen evil.\nLet your work be shown to your servants,\nand your glorious power to their children.\nLet the favor of the Lord our God be upon us,\nand establish the work of our hands upon us;\nyes, establish the work of our hands!\nTim notes that in verse 14, the English word \u201csatisfy\u201d is the Hebrew word for seven. So the writer is asking God for a completeness that only he can give.\nIn part 4 (40:45-49:30), Tim looks at the calling of Abraham in Genesis 12. Tim says that this is a seven-lined poem, and there are five promises of blessing which match the five curses earlier in Genesis 3-11. Jon notes that the conversation is actually looking at new creation through the lens of the sabbath and seventh-day rest.\nIn part 5 (49:30-55:45), Tim dives into a story about Abraham in Genesis 21.\nGenesis 21:22-34\nNow it came about at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, \u201cGod is with you in all that you do; now therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but according to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.\u201d Abraham said, \u201cI swear it.\u201d\nBut Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which the servants of Abimelech had seized. And Abimelech said, \u201cI do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor did I hear of it until today.\u201d Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant. Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. Abimelech said to Abraham, \u201cWhat do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?\u201d He said, \u201cYou shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well.\u201d Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there the two of them took an oath. So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines. Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God. And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.\nTim notes that this story is symbolic on many levels. Tim notes that the Hebrew word sheba can be translated as both \u201cseven\u201d and \u201coath.\u201d So the story represents Abraham making a \u201cseven\u201d oath with Abimelech, who symbolically represents the nations. This oath results in peace and abundance for all people involved. Tim and Jon both agree that once you start to look for it, the themes of seven, completeness, and seventh-day rest are all over the Bible.\nIn part 6 (44:45-end), Tim and Jon recap the episode and preview the next part of the story, which is Israel\u2019s enslavement in Egypt and the Exodus story.\nShow Music:\n\nDefender Instrumental by Tents\nOcean by KV\nBlue VHS by Lofi Type Beat\nLevitating by Invention\nMind Your Time by Me.So\nThe Truth About Flight, Love and BB Guns by Foreknown\n\nShow Produced by:\nDan Gummel\nShow Resources:\nAbraham Joshua Heschel, The Sabbath\nPowered and distributed by Simplecast.",

The opening line of Genesis 1 has seven words, and the central word, untranslated in English, is two Hebrew letters, the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet: aleph and taw.</p><p>When one isolates the theme of time in Genesis 1, another design pattern emerges that provides a foundation for all of Israel\u2019s rituals of sacred time.</p><p>Tim points out that there are many other ways the number seven is symbolic in the Genesis narrative: there are seven words in Genesis 1:1, and fourteen words in Genesis 1:2. There are seven paragraphs in Genesis 1:1-2:3 marked by \u201cevening and morning.\u201d The concluding seventh paragraph in Genesis 2:1-3 begins three lines which have seven words each (Gen 2:2-3a).</p><p>In part 2 (18:30-28:30), Tim summarizes a series of details about the literary design of Genesis ch. 1 from Umberto Cassuto's commentary on Genesis:</p><p>\"In view of the importance ascribed to the number seven generally, and particularly in the story of Creation, this number occurs again and again in the structure of our section. The following details are deserving of note:</p><p>(a). After the introductory verse (1:1), the section is divided into <i>seven</i> paragraphs, each of which appertains to one of the seven days. An obvious indication of this division is to be seen in the recurring sentence, <i>And there was evening and there was morning, such-and-such a day</i>. Hence the Masoretes were right in placing an open paragraph [i.e. one that begins on a new line] after each of these verses. Other ways of dividing the section suggested by some modern scholars are unsatisfactory.</p><p>(b\u2013d). Each of the three nouns that occur in the first verse and express the basic concepts of the section, <i>viz God</i> [\u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd <i>\u02beEl\u014dh\u012bm</i>] <i>heavens</i> [\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05de\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd <i>\u0161\u0101mayim</i>], <i>earth</i> [\u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 <i>\u02beere\u1e63</i>], are repeated in the section a given number of times that is a multiple of <i>seven</i>: thus the name of <i>God</i> occurs thirty-five times, that is, five times <i>seven</i> (on the fact that the Divine Name, in one of its forms, occurs seventy times in the first four chapters, see below); <i>earth</i> is found twenty-one times, that is, three times seven; similarly <i>heavens</i> (or <i>firmament</i>, \u05e8\u05b8\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2\u05b7 <i>r\u0101q\u012ba\u02bf</i>) appears twenty-one times.</p><p>(e). The ten sayings with which, according to the Talmud, the world was created (Aboth v 1; in B. Rosh Hashana 32a and B. Megilla 21b only nine of them are enumerated, the one in 1:29, apparently, being omitted)\u2014that is, the ten utterances of God beginning with the words, <i>and</i> \u2026 <i>said</i>\u2014are clearly divisible into two groups: the first group contains <i>seven</i> Divine fiats enjoining the creation of the creatures, to wit, \u201bLet there be light\u2019, \u2018Let there be a firmament\u2019, \u2018Let the waters be gathered together\u2019, \u2018Let the earth put forth vegetation\u2019, \u2018Let there be lights\u2019, \u2018Let the waters bring forth swarms\u2019, \u2018Let the earth bring forth\u2019; the second group comprises three pronouncements that emphasize God\u2019s concern for man\u2019s welfare (<i>three</i> being the number of emphasis), namely, \u2018Let us make man\u2019 (not a command but an expression of the will to create man), \u2018Be fruitful and multiply\u2019, \u2018Behold I have given unto you every plant yielding seed\u2019. Thus we have here, too, a series of <i>seven</i> corresponding dicta.</p><p>(f). The terms <i>light</i> and <i>day</i> are found, in all, <i>seven</i> times in the first paragraph, and there are <i>seven</i> references to <i>light</i> in the fourth paragraph.</p><p>(g). <i>Water</i> is mentioned <i>seven</i> times in the course of paragraphs two and three.</p><p>(h). In the fifth and sixth paragraphs forms of the word \u05d7\u05b7\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4 <i>\u1e25ayy\u0101</i> [rendered \u2018living\u2019 or \u2018beasts\u2019] occur <i>seven</i> times.</p><p>(i). The expression <i>it was good</i> appears <i>seven</i> times (the seventh time\u2014<i>very good</i>).</p><p>(j). The first verse has <i>seven</i> words.</p><p>(k). The second verse contains fourteen words\u2014twice <i>seven</i>.</p><p>(l). In the <i>seventh</i> paragraph, which deals with the <i>seventh</i> day, there occur the following three consecutive sentences (three for emphasis), each of which consists of <i>seven</i> words and contains in the middle the expression <i>the seventh day</i>:</p><p><i>And on</i> the seventh day <i>God finished His work which He had done, and He rested on</i> the seventh day <i>from all His work which</i></p><p><i>He had done</i>.</p><p><i>So God blessed</i> the seventh day <i>and hallowed it</i>.</p><p>(m). The words in the seventh paragraph total thirty-five\u2014five times <i>seven</i>.</p><p>To suppose that all this is a mere coincidence is not possible.</p><p>\u00a7 6.

Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Genesis: Part I, From Adam to Noah (Genesis I\u2013VI 8), trans. Israel Abrahams (Jerusalem: The Magnes Press, The Hebrew University, 1998), pages 13\u201315.\nTim says all of this numerical symbolism is completely intentional. The authors want us to learn that seven represents both a whole completed creation and a journey to that completeness.\nIn part 3 (28:30-41:00), Jon asks why the number seven became so symbolic in ancient Hebrew culture. Tim says the origins of the number seven being associated with completeness is likely tied to the lunar calendar of moon cycles. The biblical Hebrew word for \u201cmonth\u201d is \u201cmoon\u201d (\u05d7\u05d3\u05e9). Each month consisted of 29.5 days, and each month consisted of four 7.3-day cycles, making a \u201ccomplete\u201d cycle of time. However, the sabbath cycle is independent of the moon cycle, and sabbaths do not coincide with the new moon. It is patterned after creation, and stands outside of any natural cycle of time.\nTim then makes an important note on Hebrew word play. Seven was symbolic in ancient near eastern and Israelite culture and literature. It communicated a sense of \u201cfullness\u201d or \u201ccompleteness\u201d (\u05e9\u05d1\u05e2 \u201cseven\u201d is spelled with the same consonants as the word \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2 \u201ccomplete/full\u201d). This makes sense of the pervasive appearance of \u201cseven\u201d patterns in the Bible. For more information on this, Tim cites Maurice H. Farbridge\u2019s book, Studies in Biblical and Semitic Symbolism, 134-37.\nIn part 4 (41:00-52:30), Jon asks what it means for God to rest?\nIn response, Tim says there are two separate but related Hebrew concepts and words for rest.\nThe Hebrew word shabat means \u201cto cease from.\u201d God ceases from his work because \u201cit is finished\u201d (Gen 2:1). Compare with Joshua 5:12, \u201cThe manna ceased (shabat) on that day\u2026.\u201d\nThe Hebrew word nuakh means \u201cto take up residence.\u201d Compare with Exodus 10:14, \u201cThe locusts came up over the land of Egypt and rested (nuakh) in all the land.\u201d When God or people nuakh, it always involves settling into a place that is safe, secure, and stable. 2 Samuel 7:1 says, \u201cNow when King David dwelt in his house, for Yahweh had provided rest from his enemies\u2026.\u201d\nThe drama of the story, Tim notes, is the question as to whether humans and God will nuakh together? All of this sets a foundation for later biblical stories of Israel entering in the Promised Land, a land of rest.\nIn part 5 (52:30-end), Tim asks what it means that God blessed the seventh day?\nTim cites scholar Mathilde Frey:\n\u201cSet apart from all other days, the blessing of the seventh day establishes the seventh part of created time as a day when God grants his presence in the created world. It is then his presence that provides the blessing and the sanctification. The seventh day is blessed and established as the part of time that assures fruitfulness, future-orientation, continuity, and permanence for every aspect of life within the dimension of time. The seventh day is blessed by God\u2019s presence for the sake of the created world, for all nature, and for all living beings.\u201d (Mathilde Frey, The Sabbath in the Pentateuch, 45)\nTim says in Genesis 1, the symbolism of seven is a view that the \u201cseventh day\u201d is the culmination of all history. Tim cites scholar Samuel H. Balentine.\n\u201cUnlike the previous days, the seventh day is simply announced. There is no mention of evening or morning, no mention of a beginning or ending. The suggestion is that the primordial seventh day exists in perpetuity, a sacred day that cannot be abrogated by the limitations common to the rest of the created order.\u201d (Samuel H. Balentine, The Torah\u2019s Vision of Worship, 93)\nTim also cites scholar Robert Lowry: \u201cThe seventh-day account does not end with the expected formula, \u201cthere was evening and morning,\u201d that concluded days one through six. Breaking the pattern in this way emphasizes the uniqueness of the seventh day and opens the door to an eschatological interpretation. Literarily, the sun has not yet set on God\u2019s Sabbath.\u201d (Richard H.

            "contentSnippet": "QUOTE\n\u201cGenesis 1 isn\u2019t just telling you about what type of world you\u2019re living in; it\u2019s showing you, as a Israelite reader, that your life of worship rhythms are woven into the fabric of the universe.\u201d\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nThe idea of resting and the number seven are intimately connected in the Bible.\nIn Genesis 1, the word or number \"seven\" has two key symbolic meanings: seven represents a full and complete world, and getting to seven is a linear journey from one to seven.\nThe rhythm of practicing sabbath or resting every seventh day is one way that humans can imitate God and act like they are participating in the new creation.\n\nSHOW NOTES\nWelcome to our second episode tracing the theme of seventh-day rest in the Bible!\nIn part 1 (0-18:30), Tim shares some of the numeric symbolism in Genesis 1. The opening line of Genesis 1 has seven words, and the central word, untranslated in English, is two Hebrew letters, the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet: aleph and taw.\nWhen one isolates the theme of time in Genesis 1, another design pattern emerges that provides a foundation for all of Israel\u2019s rituals of sacred time.\nTim points out that there are many other ways the number seven is symbolic in the Genesis narrative: there are seven words in Genesis 1:1, and fourteen words in Genesis 1:2. There are seven paragraphs in Genesis 1:1-2:3 marked by \u201cevening and morning.\u201d The concluding seventh paragraph in Genesis 2:1-3 begins three lines which have seven words each (Gen 2:2-3a).\nIn part 2 (18:30-28:30), Tim summarizes a series of details about the literary design of Genesis ch. 1 from Umberto Cassuto's commentary on Genesis:\n\"In view of the importance ascribed to the number seven generally, and particularly in the story of Creation, this number occurs again and again in the structure of our section. The following details are deserving of note:\n(a). After the introductory verse (1:1), the section is divided into seven paragraphs, each of which appertains to one of the seven days. An obvious indication of this division is to be seen in the recurring sentence, And there was evening and there was morning, such-and-such a day. Hence the Masoretes were right in placing an open paragraph [i.e. one that begins on a new line] after each of these verses. Other ways of dividing the section suggested by some modern scholars are unsatisfactory.\n(b\u2013d). Each of the three nouns that occur in the first verse and express the basic concepts of the section, viz God [\u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u02beEl\u014dh\u012bm] heavens [\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05de\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u0161\u0101mayim], earth [\u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u02beere\u1e63], are repeated in the section a given number of times that is a multiple of seven: thus the name of God occurs thirty-five times, that is, five times seven (on the fact that the Divine Name, in one of its forms, occurs seventy times in the first four chapters, see below); earth is found twenty-one times, that is, three times seven; similarly heavens (or firmament, \u05e8\u05b8\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2\u05b7 r\u0101q\u012ba\u02bf) appears twenty-one times.\n(e). The ten sayings with which, according to the Talmud, the world was created (Aboth v 1; in B. Rosh Hashana 32a and B. Megilla 21b only nine of them are enumerated, the one in 1:29, apparently, being omitted)\u2014that is, the ten utterances of God beginning with the words, and \u2026 said\u2014are clearly divisible into two groups: the first group contains seven Divine fiats enjoining the creation of the creatures, to wit, \u201bLet there be light\u2019, \u2018Let there be a firmament\u2019, \u2018Let the waters be gathered together\u2019, \u2018Let the earth put forth vegetation\u2019, \u2018Let there be lights\u2019, \u2018Let the waters bring forth swarms\u2019, \u2018Let the earth bring forth\u2019; the second group comprises three pronouncements that emphasize God\u2019s concern for man\u2019s welfare (three being the number of emphasis), namely, \u2018Let us make man\u2019 (not a command but an expression of the will to create man), \u2018Be fruitful and multiply\u2019, \u2018Behold I have given unto you every plant yielding seed\u2019. Thus we have here, too, a series of seven corresponding dicta.\n(f). The terms light and day are found, in all, seven times in the first paragraph, and there are seven references to light in the fourth paragraph.\n(g). Water is mentioned seven times in the course of paragraphs two and three.\n(h). In the fifth and sixth paragraphs forms of the word \u05d7\u05b7\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4 \u1e25ayy\u0101 [rendered \u2018living\u2019 or \u2018beasts\u2019] occur seven times.\n(i). The expression it was good appears seven times (the seventh time\u2014very good).\n(j). The first verse has seven words.\n(k). The second verse contains fourteen words\u2014twice seven.\n(l). In the seventh paragraph, which deals with the seventh day, there occur the following three consecutive sentences (three for emphasis), each of which consists of seven words and contains in the middle the expression the seventh day:\nAnd on the seventh day God finished His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which\nHe had done.\nSo God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.\n(m). The words in the seventh paragraph total thirty-five\u2014five times seven.\nTo suppose that all this is a mere coincidence is not possible.\n\u00a7 6. This numerical symmetry is, as it were, the golden thread that binds together all the parts of the section and serves as a convincing proof of its unity against the view of those\u2014and they comprise the majority of modern commentators\u2014who consider that our section is not a unity but was formed by the fusion of two different accounts, or as the result of the adaptation and elaboration of a shorter earlier version.\"\nU. Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Genesis: Part I, From Adam to Noah (Genesis I\u2013VI 8), trans. Israel Abrahams (Jerusalem: The Magnes Press, The Hebrew University, 1998), pages 13\u201315.\nTim says all of this numerical symbolism is completely intentional. The authors want us to learn that seven represents both a whole completed creation and a journey to that completeness.\nIn part 3 (28:30-41:00), Jon asks why the number seven became so symbolic in ancient Hebrew culture. Tim says the origins of the number seven being associated with completeness is likely tied to the lunar calendar of moon cycles. The biblical Hebrew word for \u201cmonth\u201d is \u201cmoon\u201d (\u05d7\u05d3\u05e9). Each month consisted of 29.5 days, and each month consisted of four 7.3-day cycles, making a \u201ccomplete\u201d cycle of time. However, the sabbath cycle is independent of the moon cycle, and sabbaths do not coincide with the new moon. It is patterned after creation, and stands outside of any natural cycle of time.\nTim then makes an important note on Hebrew word play. Seven was symbolic in ancient near eastern and Israelite culture and literature. It communicated a sense of \u201cfullness\u201d or \u201ccompleteness\u201d (\u05e9\u05d1\u05e2 \u201cseven\u201d is spelled with the same consonants as the word \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2 \u201ccomplete/full\u201d). This makes sense of the pervasive appearance of \u201cseven\u201d patterns in the Bible. For more information on this, Tim cites Maurice H. Farbridge\u2019s book, Studies in Biblical and Semitic Symbolism, 134-37.\nIn part 4 (41:00-52:30), Jon asks what it means for God to rest?\nIn response, Tim says there are two separate but related Hebrew concepts and words for rest.\nThe Hebrew word shabat means \u201cto cease from.\u201d God ceases from his work because \u201cit is finished\u201d (Gen 2:1). Compare with Joshua 5:12, \u201cThe manna ceased (shabat) on that day\u2026.\u201d\nThe Hebrew word nuakh means \u201cto take up residence.\u201d Compare with Exodus 10:14, \u201cThe locusts came up over the land of Egypt and rested (nuakh) in all the land.\u201d When God or people nuakh, it always involves settling into a place that is safe, secure, and stable. 2 Samuel 7:1 says, \u201cNow when King David dwelt in his house, for Yahweh had provided rest from his enemies\u2026.\u201d\nThe drama of the story, Tim notes, is the question as to whether humans and God will nuakh together? All of this sets a foundation for later biblical stories of Israel entering in the Promised Land, a land of rest.\nIn part 5 (52:30-end), Tim asks what it means that God blessed the seventh day?\nTim cites scholar Mathilde Frey:\n\u201cSet apart from all other days, the blessing of the seventh day establishes the seventh part of created time as a day when God grants his presence in the created world.

            "contentSnippet": "SHOW DESCRIPTION\nThe sabbath. Talking about it can be complicated and confusing, yet the biblical authors wrote about it a lot. So what\u2019s it all about? The sabbath is more than an antiquated law. It\u2019s about the design of time and the human quest for rest. The sabbath and seventh-day rest is one of the key themes that starts on page one of the Bible and weaves beautifully all the way through to the end.\nFAVORITE QUOTE\n\u201cThe seventh day is like a multifaceted gem. One of the main facets is the fabric of creation as leading toward a great goal where humans imitate God and join him in ceasing from work and labor. But there\u2019s going to be another facet that\u2019s all about being a slave to our labor. And so the seventh day is a time to celebrate our liberation from slavery so that we can rest with God.\u201d\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nThe theme of the sabbath or seventh-day rest is a key theme in the Bible that starts on page one and goes all the way through to the end.\nThe word sabbath comes from the Hebrew word shabot, which means most simply \u201cto stop\u201d or \u201cto cease from.\u201d\nKeeping/observing/remembering the sabbath is one of the Ten Commandments. It sticks out as being a uniquely Jewish practice at the time in history when the commandments were given.\n\nSHOW NOTES\nWelcome to the first episode in our series on understanding seventh-day rest in the Bible!\nIn part 1 (0-6:35), Tim outlines the theme in general. He says the seventh-day rest is actually a huge theme in the Bible, even more prominent in the Scriptures than other TBP videos. Tim calls it an \u201corganizing main theme in the Bible.\u201d\nIn part 2 (6:35-23:45), Tim recounts a story from when he and Jon visited Jerusalem. They were both able to share a Sabbath meal with practicing Jews in Jerusalem. Tim shares that the Sabbath tradition is one of the longest running traditions in any culture in the world. Even the word shabat\u2019s most basic meaning is \u201cto stop.\u201d\nIn part 3 (23:45-33:00), Tim says this series isn\u2019t really going to be about the practice of sabbath but about the theme and symbolism of sabbath and seventh-day rest in the Bible. This theme is rich and complex, woven from start to finish in the Scriptures. The practice of the Sabbath itself is only one piece of the underlying message the authors are trying to communicate.\nIn part 4 (33:00-45:30), Tim and Jon discuss \u201ckeeping, observing, or remembering\u201d the sabbath in the Ten Commandments. This command sticks out as a unique Jewish practice. The Jews are told to keep the sabbath for two different reasons according to two different passages:\nExodus 20:8-11\nRemember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested (Heb. shabat) on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.\nDeuteronomy 5:12-15\nKeep the sabbath day to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or your donkey or any of your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you, so that your male servant and your female servant may rest (Heb. nuakh) as well as you. You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to observe the sabbath day.\nTim notes that in the first passage, Jews are told to keep the sabbath because it is an act of participation in God\u2019s presence and rule over creation. But in the second passage, keeping the sabbath is an act of implementing God\u2019s presence and rule by the liberation from slavery. Tim says these two ways of viewing the practice of the sabbath are two of the core ways to think about the seventh-day rest theme in the bible.\nIn part 5 (45:30-end), Tim cites scholar Matitiahu Tsevat about the biblical phrase \u201cit is a sabbath of Yahweh\u201d (\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4), literally, \u201ca sabbath that belongs to Yahweh.\u201d\n\u201cThis phrase is so important, it\u2019s easy to miss its centrality... Just as in the 7th year of release man desists from utilizing the land for his own business and benefit, so on the sabbath day he desists from using that day for his own affairs. And just \u00e4s the intervals in regard to the release year and the jubilee years are determined by the number seven, so too is the number seven determinative for that recurring day when man refrains from his own pursuits and sets it aside for God. In regular succession he breaks the natural flow of time, proclaiming, and that the break is made for the sake of the Lord. This meaning which we have ascertained from the laws finds support Isaiah 58: \u201cIf you restrain your foot on the sabbath so \u00e4s not to pursue your own affairs on My holy day\u2026\u201d Man normally is master of his time. He is free to dispose of it as he sees fit or as necessity bids him. The Israelite is duty-bound, however, once every seven days to assert by word and deed that God is the master of time. \u2026 one day out of seven the Israelite is to renounce dominion over his own time and recognize God's dominion over it. Simply: Every seventh day the Israelite renounces his autonomy and affirms God's dominion over him in the conclusion that every seventh day the Israelite is to renounce dominion over time, thereby renounce autonomy, and recognize God's dominion over time and thus over himself. Keeping the sabbath is acceptance of the kingdom and sovereignty of God.\u201d (Matitiahu Tsevat, The Basic Meaning of the Biblical Sabbath, 453-455.)\nTim says the structure of the sabbath is meant to be inconvenient. God is the master of all time, and he holds all the time that we think actually belongs to us.\nShow Music:\n\nDefender Instrumental by Tents\nRoyalty Free Middle Eastern Music\nShabot Songs:\nPsalm 121 (Lai Lai Lai) by Joshua Aaron\nL'maancha by Eitan Katz\n\n\nResources:\n\nhttp://joshua-aaron.com/\nhttp://www.eitankatz.com/\nMatitiahu Tsevat, The Basic Meaning of the Biblical Sabbath\n\nShow Produced by:\nDan Gummel\nPowered and distributed by Simplecast",

God wants a group of witnesses who experience him and then talk about it.\u201d</i></p><p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p>In part 1, (0-7:45) Tim and Jon introduce the topic and also introduce Carissa Quinn a biblical scholar on staff with the bible project. Carisa is responsible for researching and writing the script for the upcoming video on witness. The group talks about the popular usages of the word witness. Jon toes that in a Christian context, \u201cwitness\u201d is often meant to be an activity that someone will do to try and logically convince or debate somebody (a non believer) about Jesus and the truth of the bible.</p><p>The group also notes that oftentimes \u2018witness\u2019 is best understood in a modern legal context.</p><p>In part 2, (7:45-16:50) Carissa says the word witness occurs over 400 hundred times in the bible in a variety of forms. In hebrew the word \u2018witness\u2019 is basically (1) someone who sees something amazing or important--in Hebrew, this person is an \u05e2\u05b5\u05d3 (eid) and in Greek, a \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2 (m\u00e1rtus). And (2) if this person begins to share what they\u2019ve seen, we call this \u2018bearing witness\u2019: in Hebrew \u05e2\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3 (uwd) and in Greek \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9 (martur\u00e9o).</p><p>Carissa shares the story of Ruth in Ruth 4:9, when Boaz buys land from Naomi\u2019s family, he calls together witnesses to see the transaction, so that if there\u2019s a later dispute about the land, they can bear witness about what they saw. Tim notes that this passage is somewhat related to Deut 25:9 a law about sandals and witnessing being used as a form of legal documentation.</p><p>The group briefly discusses the role of a public notary in modern culture. They act as official witnesses to legal signings.</p><p>In part 3, (16:50-24:50) Carissa goes to Psalm 27 and the theme of \u201cfalse witnesses\u201d. Carissa notes that God is referred to as a witness throughout the bible. For example in Genesis 31:49 ... \u201cMay the Lord watch between you and me when we are absent one from the other. 50 If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us, see, God is witness between you and me.\u201d</p><p>In the New Testament God the Father is said to bear witness to the identity of Jesus. Jesus also says he bears witness to himself in John 8:17-18 \u201cIn your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true. 18 I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.\u201d</p><p>Carissa then notes that many times Paul uses a phrase like \u201cGod is my witness\u201d for example in Romans 1:9 \u201cFor God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you 10 always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.\u201d</p><p>In part 4 (24:50-42:45)</p><p>Carissa continues the conversation by bringing up the fact that an object can be a witness in the bible. For example in Joshua 24: 27 And Joshua said to all the people, \u201cBehold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the Lord that he spoke to us. Therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God.\u201d</p><p>Carissa then notes that the word \u201cwitness\u201d in the bible can be used to trace the whole story of the bible. Tim says that the word \u201cwitness\u201d is an interesting way to think about the image of god. People are created in God\u2019s image to \u201cwitness\u201d god and his creation to the rest of the world.</p><p>Carissa says that israel is called to be a witness to the other nations in Exodus 19:4-6 \u201c \u2018You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. 5 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; 6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\u201d</p><p>Carissa says that later in the bible the torah is referred to as a \u201cwitness\u201d and is often called \u201cthe laws of the testimony\u201d. Meaning the laws are testifying or witnessing the relationship between god and israel. Additionally, Moses writes a song in Deuteronomy 32 to bear witness to Israel about God.</p><p>Carissa points out that in John 5, Jesus says the Torah points to him in John 5:39 \u201cYou search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me.\u201d</p><p>In part 5 (42:45-49:20)</p><p>Carissa notes the theme of the word witness in the prophets. For example 2 Chronicles 24:19 \"Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to the Lord. These testified (witnessed) against them, but they would not pay attention.</p><p>Carissa notes that to testify against or to witness against was one of the primary roles of prophets in the Old Testament.

But often times in the New Testament being a witness is directly connected to verifying or believing in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.\nJon notes that witness in modern context is usually more about debating ore rationalizing Jesus and Christianity to a secular world. Carissa notes that to \u201cbear witness\u201d is a sign of someone's character. Jon then notes that thinking about being a witness in life is actually a really important calling or job. A witness has an important role to play and \u201cbearing witness\u201d is what we are called to do as christians. Not to debate or convince people about the truth of Jesus but to share are own powerful moments of God in our lives.\nShow Resources:\nWalter Kaiser, Mission in the Old Testament: Israel as a Light to the Nations\nShow Music\n\u00a0\nDiscover by C Y G N\nFills the Skies: Josh White\nBlue Skies: Unwritten Stories\nAnalogs: Moby\nThe Truth About Flight Love and BB Guns: Beautiful Eulogy\nShow Produced by:\nDan Gummel\nPowered and distributed by Simplecast.",

Whereas in other cultures, healings and miracles and those who performed them were considered an integral part of life and evidence of God or the gods\u2019 work. Tim shares a helpful resource called <i>The Lost Letters of Pergamum</i>, which is a short historical novel set in ancient Roman culture during the early days of Christianity. The novel helps readers more accurately picture what the original claims of the gospel would have meant to the first followers of Christ.</p><p>Tim then says most Western Protestants read these accounts through asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the application of this gospel story to my life and how will it improve my life?\u201d Tim says he doesn\u2019t think this is the best way to read the gospels. Instead, readers should learn to read the gospels as intricate and complete portraits of Jesus Christ of Nazareth that are claiming that Jesus is the promised Jewish Messiah.</p><p>In part 3 (22:00-32:00), Tim notes that every Gospel climaxes with Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection. Tim then contrasts this with the Gospel of Thomas, which does not include Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection narrative. To the gnostics who used the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus was a wise, divine teacher who dispensed knowledge to humanity to help them learn to be wise.</p><p>Tim then says that a good example of the gospels climaxing with Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection would be the Gospel of Mark.

It also should be taken into consideration that what many modern Christians may perceive to be untruths or discrepancies in the Bible were much more accepted by early Christians.

And then all of them are saying the story leads up to the moment of a Jewish wonder-worker\u2019s execution. It\u2019s a simple point. But that is their main point.\"\nIn part 1 (0-11:30), Tim and Jon briefly recap the series so far. They discuss the earlier tips for reading the gospels more effectively and deeply. Tim says readers should always remember that the gospels are meant to be stories about Jesus, but they have been specifically selected to be persuasive stories about Jesus. The Gospel authors want the reader to believe that Jesus is the Messiah. Sometimes they make this intent obvious and explicit, but other times, they make the claims indirectly. Tim says this method of indirect communication and indirect claims about Jesus is the primary way that Gospel authors design their portraits of Jesus.\nIn part 2 (11:30-22:00), Tim notes that many of the stories about Jesus, including the stories of miracles, sound unbelievable to many modern Western audiences. Whereas in other cultures, healings and miracles and those who performed them were considered an integral part of life and evidence of God or the gods\u2019 work. Tim shares a helpful resource called The Lost Letters of Pergamum, which is a short historical novel set in ancient Roman culture during the early days of Christianity. The novel helps readers more accurately picture what the original claims of the gospel would have meant to the first followers of Christ.\nTim then says most Western Protestants read these accounts through asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the application of this gospel story to my life and how will it improve my life?\u201d Tim says he doesn\u2019t think this is the best way to read the gospels. Instead, readers should learn to read the gospels as intricate and complete portraits of Jesus Christ of Nazareth that are claiming that Jesus is the promised Jewish Messiah.\nIn part 3 (22:00-32:00), Tim notes that every Gospel climaxes with Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection. Tim then contrasts this with the Gospel of Thomas, which does not include Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection narrative. To the gnostics who used the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus was a wise, divine teacher who dispensed knowledge to humanity to help them learn to be wise.\nTim then says that a good example of the gospels climaxing with Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection would be the Gospel of Mark. Most of the book highlights the final week of Jesus\u2019 life and does a fast fly-by of Jesus\u2019 earlier life leading up to the week of the Passover and crucifixion.\nMost stories, Tim observes, end with the good guy defeating the bad guy, thereby using force and violence to triumph. The Jesus story claims that Jesus triumphed by allowing himself to be killed by his enemies. He then was raised from the dead and gives his enemies an opportunity to enter into new life by believing in him.\nIn part 5 (32:00-end), Tim and Jon discuss the differences between the gospels. Tim says that some of the variances between the stories in the gospels used to bother him. Why couldn\u2019t all the stories be the same? Aren\u2019t the discrepancies evidence that these stories and authors might be unreliable?\nHowever, Tim continues by sharing that over time, his perspective has changed. Now, he realizes that the Gospel authors are advancing a claim about Jesus, not recounting security camera footage of his life. The authors want the reader to understand that Jesus had a totally different way of seeing the world, so they highlight this in their own style. Tim says he would actually be highly suspicious if all the gospels\u2019 stories are exactly identical. That would imply that the Jesus story was not authentic. It also should be taken into consideration that what many modern Christians may perceive to be untruths or discrepancies in the Bible were much more accepted by early Christians. Modern readers should attempt to understand the context and culture of how the gospels were formed instead of importing our own modern view of a biography onto an ancient text.\nShow Music:\n\n\u201cDefender\u201d instrumental by Tents\n\u201cNostalgic\u201d by junior state\n\u201clacuna\u201d by leavv\n\u201cBeautiful Eulogy\u201d by Beautiful Eulogy\n\nShow Resources:\nThe Lost Letters of Pergamum: A Story from the New Testament World by Bruce Longenecker\nShow Produced by:\nDan Gummel\nPowered and distributed by Simplecast",

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Key takeaways:\n\nThe four gospels all tell a unique perspective of the same story. They all claim Jesus is the Jewish Messiah who fulfills the Hebrew Scriptures.\nMark is widely considered to be the oldest Gospel.\nThe genealogies at the start of Matthew have hidden design patterns in them that unify the Old and New Testaments.\nThe story of Zacharias and Elizabeth at the start of Luke is meant to layer onto the story of Abraham and Sarah in the Old Testament. This is a key design pattern of Luke. Luke likes to create the characters in his book based off Old Testament figures.\n\nQuote: \u201c(The gospels) are constantly and from the first moment tying the Jesus story back into Hebrew scriptures. There isn\u2019t a story or teaching about Jesus that isn\u2019t packed with Old Testament allusion.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn part 1 (0-5:00), Tim and Jon briefly recap the last episode. Tim says he\u2019s going to unpack four ways that readers can better understand and uncover themes in the gospels.\nIn part 2 (5:00-14:00), Tim dives into advanced ways to read these accounts. One way to take your reading of the gospels to the next level is to get a Bible that shows when a Gospel is citing or quoting an Old Testament passage. For example, Tim focuses on the book of Mark. Most scholars view Mark as the oldest of the gospels.\nMark 1 shares links to both Isaiah 40:3 and Malachi 4:5-6 in the first verses.\nMark 1:1-3\nThe beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet:\n\u201cI will send my messenger ahead of you,\nwho will prepare your way\u201d\u2014\n\u201ca voice of one calling in the wilderness,\n\u2018Prepare the way for the Lord,\nmake straight paths for him.\u2019\u201d\nTim says that this should alert the reader to the fact that Mark is heavily influenced by the Old Testament. Mark is reading the Old Testament, and his Gospel is structured around and informed by the Hebrew Scriptures.\nIn part 3 (14:00-22:30), Tim then looks at the start of Matthew. The book begins with a genealogy. This genealogy is broken into three movements of fourteen generations: fourteen from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile, and fourteen from the exile to Jesus.\nIn order to stick to this pattern, Tim notes, generations would have been left out. So why would Matthew use this pattern?\nThere are several thoughts. One is that the number fourteen is the numerical value of the name \u201cDavid.\u201d So Matthew is disguising his claim that Jesus is a new and better David in this genealogy.\nTim also mentions that four women are mentioned in this genealogy. Each of them are non-Jewish women. Again, why does Matthew do this? He wants you to know that Gentile women in the Old Testament played a crucial role in carrying on\u2014and in some cases rescuing\u2014the messianic seed.\nIn part 4 (22:30-32:30), Tim dives into the opening of the Gospel of Luke. The story of Elizabeth and Zacharias is meant to map onto the story of Abraham and Sarah. Both couples are old and have no children or heirs. Luke then moves onto the introduction of Mary. Mary\u2019s response to the angel\u2019s proclamation is different than Zacharias\u2019 response. So Luke uses a lot of character design to overlap Old Testament and New Testament characters in order to show a new act of God.\nIn part 5 (32:30-47:30), Tim dives into the opening in the Gospel of John. There are themes of Genesis 1 (\u201cIn the beginning\u201d) and Lady Wisdom from Proverbs 8 in the opening lines of John. Many modern Western readers find John's writing style to be the most approachable and easy to understand. John's links and callbacks to earlier Hebrew Scriptures are more obvious to the untrained eye than in the other gospels.\nIn part 6 (47:30-end), Tim and Jon dive into Mathew 11.\nMatthew 11:2-6\nWhen John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples to ask him, \u201cAre you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?\u201d\nJesus replied, \u201cGo back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.\u201d\nTim says that this passage is heavily influenced by Isaiah 35 because Jesus quotes from this passage to answer John's question about whether he is the Messiah or not.\nIsaiah 35:1-7\nThe desert and the parched land will be glad;\nthe wilderness will rejoice and blossom.\nLike the crocus, it will burst into bloom;\nit will rejoice greatly and shout for joy.\nThe glory of Lebanon will be given to it,\nthe splendor of Carmel and Sharon;\nthey will see the glory of the Lord,\nthe splendor of our God.\nStrengthen the feeble hands,\nsteady the knees that give way;\nsay to those with fearful hearts,\n\u201cBe strong, do not fear;\nyour God will come,\nhe will come with vengeance;\nwith divine retribution\nhe will come to save you.\u201d\nThen will the eyes of the blind be opened\nand the ears of the deaf unstopped.\nThen will the lame leap like a deer,\nand the mute tongue shout for joy.\nWater will gush forth in the wilderness\nand streams in the desert.\nThe burning sand will become a pool,\nthe thirsty ground bubbling springs.\nIn the haunts where jackals once lay,\ngrass and reeds and papyrus will grow.\nShow Music:\n\nDefender Instrumental by Tents\nMind Your Time by Me.So\nSubtle Break by Ghostrifter Official\nSerenity by JayJen\nAcquired in Heaven by Beautiful Eulogy\nFor When It\u2019s Warmer by Sleepyfish\nEuk's First Race by David Gummel\n\nShow Resources:\n\nWhat Are the Gospels?: A Comparison with Graeco-Roman Biography by Richard Burridge\nReading the Gospels Wisely: A Narrative and Theological Introduction by Jonathan Pennington\nA brief overview of Jewish history pre-Christ and during Roman rule.\nFor more on the different scholarly views on the meaning and background of Lady Wisdom in Israelite history, see Michael Fox's Anchor Bible Commentary: Proverbs 1-9 on pages 331-345 and 352-359.\n\nShow Produced by:\nDan Gummel\nPowered and distributed by Simplecast.",

            "content": "<p>In part 1 (0-19:00), Tim and Jon give a brief historical overview of Israel at the time Jesus was born. Israel had been under hundreds of years of military occupation by different empires. At the time of Jesus, that empire is Rome. Tim notes that the entire Jewish people would have had a sense of expectation. The Hebrew Scriptures taught them that the glory of the Jewish kingdom would return and a messiah would rescue them. This mindset\u2014though difficult for us to imagine\u2014was that of an ancient Jew under Roman rule at the time when the gospels were written.</p><p>In part 2 (19:00-25:00), Tim notes that for one to declare or be declared as \u201cmessiah\u201d while under Roman rule would have been viewed as an act of politcal insurrrection and revolution.</p><p>In part 3 (25:00-38:45), Tim outlines the history of the word gospel, which comes from the old English word \u201cgodspel\u201d or *good tidings*. This word in Greek is \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd and Tim notes that \u201cthe euangelion\u201d is what Jesus is said to proclaim in the beginning of Mark. Mark 1:1 *The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.* Tim then notes how Paul uses the same word at the start of Romans. Romans 1:2-4 *the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David, and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.* Tim also shared 1 Corinthians 15:1-8. *Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas,and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.* Tim notes that Paul doesn\u2019t have a stock phrase or answer for \u201cwhat is the gospel.\u201d Instead he tweaks the message in both of these books and offers two complimentary answers. This example from Paul should make us cautious of trying to boil down the gospel to a simple formula. If Paul didn\u2019t really do it that way, why should we? Instead we should try to learn how to articulate the whole story of the Jewish Scriptures and distill the gospel through that lens.</p><p>In part 4 (38:45-44:45), Tim also brings up Paul\u2019s speech to the Athenians in Acts 17: Acts 17:22-34 *Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: \u201cPeople of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: to an unknown god. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship\u2014and this is what I am going to proclaim to you.* *\u201cThe God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us. \u2018For in him we live and move and have our being.\u2019 As some of your own poets have said, \u2018We are his offspring.\u2019* *\u201cTherefore since we are God\u2019s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone\u2014an image made by human design and skill. In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.\u201d* *When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, \u201cWe want to hear you again on this subject.\u201d At that, Paul left the Council. Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.* Tim notes that also in this presentation, Paul does not bring up Christ\u2019s atoning death explictly. The atoning death of Christ is part of the gospel, but it is not the whole. The larger story of the gospel is portrayed in the four books known as the Gospels. What is the larger story? It is about Jesus inaugurating the kingdom of God.</p><p>In part 5 (44:45-end), Tim gives his own definitions of the four books known as \"the Gospels.\" \"The gospels are carefully designed theological biographies of Jesus of Nazareth. They focus on his announcement of the euangelion. They are not merely historical records. They are designed to advance a claim that will challenge the readers thinking and behavior, and you are going to be forced to make a decision about Jesus after reading the book.

Wright to discuss the historical meaning of the word \u201cgospel.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part 1 (0-21:20), Dr. Wright notes that word studies are great, but it\u2019s important to understand how words derive their meaning and live in a narrative context. Alternaitve \u201cgospels,\u201d including the Gospel of Thomas, typically are a collection of good advice or wise sayings from Jesus about how to live a good life, whereas the whole \u201cgospel\u201d or <em>good news</em> is the story of Jesus being crowned king and Israel being used by God to bless all the nations.</p>\n<p>Tim shares an interesting historical ancedote: a birthday announcement from a historical source called the Calendar of Priene. It\u2019s an old royal announcement from the Roman emporer Augustus Caesar, and it uses the Greek word for \u201cgospel,\u201d \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, <em>evangelion</em>, meaning &quot;good news.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Since Providence, which has ordered all things and is deeply interested in our life, has set in most perfect order by giving us Augustus, whom she filled with virtue that he might benefit humankind, sending him as a savior, both for us and for our descendants, that he might end war and arrange all things, and since he, Caesar, by his appearance (excelled even our anticipations), surpassing all previous benefactors, and not even leaving to posterity any hope of surpassing what he has done, and since the birthday of the god Augustus was the beginning of the good tidings for the world that came by reason of him.\u201d (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_Inscription_of_Priene\"><em>The Calendar of Priene</em>, Caesar Birthday announcement)</a></p>\n<p>Dr. Wright says this historical announcement reveals a very interesting historical narrative. The Roman emporers continually decreed that they had brought peace and justice to the world through violent and political power. These emporers used the same language and vocubulary as the gospel authors when they proclaim Jesus of Nazareth as the one who brings true peace and justice to the world.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (21:20-27:10), Tim and Dr. Wright discuss that \u201cnews\u201d is an ineffective  modern word to describe the gospel. A better alternative in our day would be \u201cannouncement\u201d or \u201cproclamation.\u201d Today, the word \u201cnews\u201d is used most often to describe everyday occurences, whereas the historical word \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, <em>evangelion</em>, was far less common and treated with importance.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (27:10-42:45), Tim and Dr. Wright dive into the Gospel of Mark and Matthew.</p>\n<p>Dr. Wright focuses on the Beatitudes in Matthew. Instead of it being just an ethical to-do list, the Beatitudes are meant to model what God\u2019s kingdom actually looks like. They represent the corporate moral ethic of God\u2019s kingdom, showing what a world looks like when God becomes king and showing how God's kingdom spreads throughout the world.</p>\n<p>Tim and Dr. Wright both cite Isaiah 53, one of the key bridges between the Old and New Testament in the Suffering Servant. They move on to discuss a book by Dr. Richard Hayes called, \u201cEchoes of Scripture in the Gospels\u201d and discuss the royal enactment portrayls in the gospels. Tim and Dr. Wright note that these are very obvious themes. Jesus is given a purple robe and crowned with a crown of thorns. These themes are meant to be picked up by the reader as evidence of the upside down nature of the kingdom that Jesus was enacting. He became king through suffering.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (42:45-56:00), Tim and Dr. Wright talk about Paul and his perspective of \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, <em>evangelion</em>. Tim reads from Romans 1:1-6:</p>\n<p>&quot;Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim also shares 1 Corinthians 15:1-11:</p>\n<p>\u201cNow I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you\u2014unless you believed in vain.</p>\n<p>&quot;For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim thinks this 1 Corinthians passage may be over-dominant in Western Christianity\u2019s understanding in defining the gospel. Dr. Wright notes a historical view stemming from German and Lutheran interpretation that wants to see \u201cthe gospel\u201d only as a salvation by faith that Christ died for our sins on the cross.</p>\n<p>This view, Dr. Wright asserts, shortchanges the story of the Hebrew Scriptures. While this is part of the meaning of the word \u201cgospel,\u201d the whole story of the Hebrew Scriptures involves the signficance of Jesus being the new and exalted human, the new Adam, through whom humanity can now realize their orginal destiny that was laid out for them in the Garden of Eden.</p>\n<p>In part 5 (56:00-end), Tim and Dr. Wright wrap up their time together by discussing how word studies are important but need to be tied into an informed understanding of the whole narrative of the Hebrew Bible.</p>\n<p>Show Produced by:<br />\nDan Gummel</p>\n<p>Show Music:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defender Instrumental by Tents</li>\n<li>Daydreams 2 by Chillhop</li>\n<li>Fills the Skies by Josh White</li>\n<li>Yesterday on Repeat by Vexento</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show Resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Gospel of Thomas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Thomas)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_Inscription_of_Priene\">The Calendar of Priene, Caesar Birthday Announcement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_53\">The Suffering Servant</a></li>\n<li>Umberto Cassuto, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZMBH08\">From Adam to Noah: A Commentary on the Book of Genesis I-VI</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Powered and distributed by Simplecast.</p>\n",

Instead of it being just an ethical to-do list, the Beatitudes are meant to model what God\u2019s kingdom actually looks like. They represent the corporate moral ethic of God\u2019s kingdom, showing what a world looks like when God becomes king and showing how God's kingdom spreads throughout the world.\nTim and Dr. Wright both cite Isaiah 53, one of the key bridges between the Old and New Testament in the Suffering Servant. They move on to discuss a book by Dr. Richard Hayes called, \u201cEchoes of Scripture in the Gospels\u201d and discuss the royal enactment portrayls in the gospels. Tim and Dr. Wright note that these are very obvious themes. Jesus is given a purple robe and crowned with a crown of thorns. These themes are meant to be picked up by the reader as evidence of the upside down nature of the kingdom that Jesus was enacting. He became king through suffering.\nIn part 4 (42:45-56:00), Tim and Dr. Wright talk about Paul and his perspective of \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, evangelion. Tim reads from Romans 1:1-6:\n\"Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.\"\nTim also shares 1 Corinthians 15:1-11:\n\u201cNow I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you\u2014unless you believed in vain.\n\"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.\u201d\nTim thinks this 1 Corinthians passage may be over-dominant in Western Christianity\u2019s understanding in defining the gospel. Dr. Wright notes a historical view stemming from German and Lutheran interpretation that wants to see \u201cthe gospel\u201d only as a salvation by faith that Christ died for our sins on the cross.\nThis view, Dr. Wright asserts, shortchanges the story of the Hebrew Scriptures. While this is part of the meaning of the word \u201cgospel,\u201d the whole story of the Hebrew Scriptures involves the signficance of Jesus being the new and exalted human, the new Adam, through whom humanity can now realize their orginal destiny that was laid out for them in the Garden of Eden.\nIn part 5 (56:00-end), Tim and Dr. Wright wrap up their time together by discussing how word studies are important but need to be tied into an informed understanding of the whole narrative of the Hebrew Bible.\nShow Produced by:\nShow Music:\nDefender Instrumental by Tents\nDaydreams 2 by Chillhop\nFills the Skies by Josh White\nYesterday on Repeat by Vexento\nShow Resources:\nThe Gospel of Thomas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Thomas)\nThe Calendar of Priene, Caesar Birthday Announcement\nThe Suffering Servant\nUmberto Cassuto, From Adam to Noah: A Commentary on the Book of Genesis I-VI\nPowered and distributed by Simplecast.",
            "contentSnippet": "Welcome to a special episode that kicks off our series of How to Read the Gospels. In this episode, Tim sits down with Dr. N.T. Wright to discuss the historical meaning of the word \u201cgospel.\u201d\nIn part 1 (0-21:20), Dr. Wright notes that word studies are great, but it\u2019s important to understand how words derive their meaning and live in a narrative context. Alternaitve \u201cgospels,\u201d including the Gospel of Thomas, typically are a collection of good advice or wise sayings from Jesus about how to live a good life, whereas the whole \u201cgospel\u201d or good news is the story of Jesus being crowned king and Israel being used by God to bless all the nations.\nTim shares an interesting historical ancedote: a birthday announcement from a historical source called the Calendar of Priene. It\u2019s an old royal announcement from the Roman emporer Augustus Caesar, and it uses the Greek word for \u201cgospel,\u201d \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, evangelion, meaning \"good news.\"\n\"Since Providence, which has ordered all things and is deeply interested in our life, has set in most perfect order by giving us Augustus, whom she filled with virtue that he might benefit humankind, sending him as a savior, both for us and for our descendants, that he might end war and arrange all things, and since he, Caesar, by his appearance (excelled even our anticipations), surpassing all previous benefactors, and not even leaving to posterity any hope of surpassing what he has done, and since the birthday of the god Augustus was the beginning of the good tidings for the world that came by reason of him.\u201d (The Calendar of Priene, Caesar Birthday announcement)\nDr. Wright says this historical announcement reveals a very interesting historical narrative. The Roman emporers continually decreed that they had brought peace and justice to the world through violent and political power. These emporers used the same language and vocubulary as the gospel authors when they proclaim Jesus of Nazareth as the one who brings true peace and justice to the world.\nIn part 2 (21:20-27:10), Tim and Dr. Wright discuss that \u201cnews\u201d is an ineffective  modern word to describe the gospel.

Thanks for everything you do and for helping me reshape my biblical paradigms so that I may now understand the biblical story in a whole new way.</p>\n<p>Nadia from the UK (11:27):<br />\nMy question is with Cain and Abel: isn't it because the Lord looked on Abel's offering more favorably because he brought the best, the fattened part of his flock and the firstborn of his flock? In comparison to what Cain brought, which was just some of the fruit; it doesn\u2019t say it was the first fruits or the best of, it was just some, and therefore, God looked more favorably on Abel\u2019s, which is why Cain\u2019s was rejected. Thanks!</p>\n<p>Seth from Cincinnati (12:03):<br />\nYou guys have discussed the reasons for why God favored Abel over Cain. The author of Hebrews says, &quot;By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks&quot; (Hebrews 11:4). ...We can infer that by contrast that Cain's must not have been offered by faith. What do you think of this interpretation?</p>\n<p>Lauren from Indiana (30:00):<br />\nI love the parable you have going and that we make choices based on fear that abundance will stop, and we need to hoard. That immediately took me to Exodus 16 and the manna that Moses told them to not leave any until morning. Of course, some people did anyway, and it was spoiled. To me, that's a really obvious example of your parable, but are we supposed to be mapping that onto Genesis specifically, or was that just a happy piece of serendipity?</p>\n<p>Nathaniel from New Orleans (35:56):<br />\nYou've focused on how the human self-protective instinct and  greed will ruin the party for everyone. But I was curious as to how natural disasters in Scripture\u2014whether they're portrayed as a time of punishment for the wicked or time of testing of the righteous, or or both\u2014how those interact with the image of God as generous host. Thank you very much, and God bless.</p>\n<p>Secret from Wisconsin (48:00):<br />\nMy question was: is there a specific context that we should have in mind when Jesus tells the Young Rich Ruler to go sell all his possessions, and give them away? Just because I know that in some cases it's not very wise to give away all you have because then you become dependent upon other people to help you, and you can't really help people yourself in the way you could if you had those resources.

The gift of the land places an obligation upon Israel: the gift is unconditioned (unmerited), but not unconditional (non-reciprocal). It is not given to Israel based on an evaluation of their worthiness, but it is given with a clear expectation of obligated response.</p>\n<p>Then Tim dives into Matthew 5:43-48 to make the point that the fundamental depiction of God in the New Testament is that of a generous gift giver whose generosity should effect a transformation of our lives.</p>\n<p>Matthew 5:43-48\u2028<br />\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\u2028 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?\u2028 Therefore you are to be complete, as your heavenly Father is complete.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part 2 (16:40-33:40), Tim dives into more passages in the New Testament that build on this theme.</p>\n<p>John 3:16<br />\nGod so love the world, that he gave his one and only Son, so that whoever believes in him would not perish but have eternal life.</p>\n<p>1 John 3:1<br />\nSee how great a love the Father has given on us, that we would be called children of God; and that is what we are.</p>\n<p>1 John 5:11\u2028<br />\nAnd the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</p>\n<p>Romans 8:31-32\u2028<br />\nWhat then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him over for us all, how will he not also with him freely gift us all things?</p>\n<p>James 1:17<br />\nEvery good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.</p>\n<p>Tim says that the generosity Jesus dispenses exposes the heart of humanity, which is bent toward selfishness. Being generous in the way that Jesus is generous creates a different kind of security than economic security. It\u2019s a security based on a community that truly loves each other, sharing freely with each other.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (33:40-45:15), Tim dives into 2 Corinthians 8.</p>\n<p>2 Corinthians 8:1-11<br />\n\u2028Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.\u2028 For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord, begging us with much urging for the grace of participation (Greek: koinonia) in the service of the saints, and this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God.\u2028 So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, so he would also complete in you this grace as well. But just as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you, see that you abound in this grace also.\u2028 I am not speaking this as a command, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also.\u2028 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.\u2028 I give my opinion in this matter, for this is to your advantage, who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this, but also to desire to do it.\u2028 But now finish doing it also, so that just as there was the readiness to desire it, so there may be also the completion of it by your ability.</p>\n<p>Tim notes that the word for grace is the same word for gift in Greek (charis, noun: \u201cgrace, gift\u201d and charizomai, verb: \u201cto give a gift, forgive\u201d).</p>\n<p>In part 4 (45:15-end), the guys wrap up their conversation.

            "content": "<p>In this episode, Tim and Jon trace this theme through the Old Testament.</p>\n<p>In part 1 (0-19:45), the guys briefly recap their discussion so far. Tim notes that Eve\u2019s reaction in Hebrew between the birth of Cain and the birth of Seth are decidedly different. Tim says that Eve takes an arrogant stance by naming Cain, seeming to place herself alongside God. However, she takes a humble stance when she names Seth, seeing that God has granted her a son. Tim quotes scholar Umberto Cassuto:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first woman in her joy at giving birth to her first son, boasts of her generative power, which in her estimation approximates the divine creative power. The Lord formed the first man, and I have formed the second man. Literally, \u2018I have created a man with the Lord,\u2019 by which she means, \u2018I stand together equally with the Creator in the rank of creators.\u2019\u201d<br />\n(Umberto Cassuto, Commentary on the Book of Genesis: Part I - From Adam to Noah)</p>\n<p>Tim notes that in the Bible, there are many stories of parents who abuse the gifts that God gives them in the ability to reproduce and have children, or they take undue parental pride in the gift of children.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (19:45-25:45), Tim and Jon discuss the theme of God choosing one over another. Tim points out that God\u2019s choosing of one over another is actually a desire to bless all through the exaltation of the one. God says Cain will be exalted if he only obeys. Instead, Cain chooses to bow to his sinful desires.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (25:45-32:30), Tim moves onto the story of the Tower of Babel. Humans were called to spread out and rule the earth. Instead of embracing that gift, the humans decide to build a towering city.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (32:30-44:15), Tim dives into the story of Abraham. God chooses one family, the family of Abraham. Tim says that the Promised Land is God\u2019s \u201cgift\u201d to Abraham\u2019s family:</p>\n<p>Genesis 12:1-3\u2028<br />\nNow the Lord said to Abram,\u2028<br />\n\u201cGo forth from your country,<br />\nAnd from your family\u2028<br />\nAnd from your father\u2019s house,<br />\n\u2028To the land which I will show you;\u2028<br />\nAnd I will make you a great nation,\u2028<br />\nAnd I will bless you,\u2028<br />\nAnd make your name great;\u2028<br />\nAnd you shall be a blessing;\u2028<br />\nAnd I will bless those who bless you,<br />\n\u2028And the one who treats you as cursed, I will curse.\u2028<br />\nAnd in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Genesis 12:7<br />\n\u201cTo your seed I will give this land.\u201d So he built an altar there to Yahweh who appeared to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jon points out that sometimes famines come along. Sometimes, there isn\u2019t enough. This tension does exist in the Bible, Tim notes, between God\u2019s abundance and the existence of chaos. God didn\u2019t create a perfectly safe world. He created a world where humans were to learn to co-rule with him, creating order from chaos.</p>\n<p>In part 5 (44:15-end), Tim notes that God keeps giving the Promised Land to Israel, and they keep misusing the gift. He cites two passages from Deuteronomy.</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 11:8-14<br />\n\u201cYou all shall therefore keep every commandment which I am commanding you today, so that you may be strong and go in and possess the land... so that you may prolong your days on the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. For the land, into which you are entering to possess it, is not like the land of Egypt from which you came, where you used to sow your seed and water it with your foot like a vegetable garden. But the land into which you are about to cross to possess it, a land of hills and valleys, drinks water from the rain of heaven, a land for which the Lord your God cares; the eyes of the Lord your God are always on it, from the beginning even to the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\u2028\u201cIt shall come about, if you listen obediently to my commandments which I am commanding you today, to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and all your soul, that he will give the rain for your land in its season, the barley and late rain, that you may gather in your grain and your new wine and your oil.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim then cites scholar Joshua Berman, saying that Israel\u2019s economy was an \u201cExodus-style\u201d economy:</p>\n<p>\u201cA key theological claim at work in these laws is that of God\u2019s identity as the liberator of slaves. He forms a people out of those who were deemed to be people of no standing at all by the political and economic leaders who oppressed them. The egalitarian streak within Pentateuchal law codes accords with the portrayal of the Exodus as the prime experience of Israel\u2019s self-understanding. Indeed, no Israelite can lay claim to any greater status than another, because all emanate from the Exodus\u2014a common seminal, liberating, and equalizing event\u2026 This notion of God\u2019s sovereignty as creator and liberator animated the biblical laws aimed at preventing Israelites from descending into the cycle of poverty and debt.\u201d<br />\n(Joshua Berman, Created Equal: How the Bible Broke with Ancient Political Thought, 88)</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 24:19-22<br />\n\u201cWhen you are harvesting in your field and you overlook a sheaf, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the immigrant, the fatherless and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the immigrant, the fatherless and the widow. When you harvest the grapes in your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt.

The biblical portrait of evil, Tim shares, begins with a desire for what is not rightly mine and then taking it for oneself.</p>\n<p>Genesis 3:1-6<br />\nNow the snake was more shrewd than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, \u201cIndeed, has God said, \u2018You shall not eat from any tree of the garden\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman said to the serpent, \u201cFrom the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, \u2018You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p>The serpent said to the woman, \u201cYou surely will not die! For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\u201d When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable for making wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.</p>\n<p>Beginning in verse 1, Tim notes, \u201cYou shall not eat from any tree of the garden\u201d is an act of subtly undermining God\u2019s generosity. Again this subtlety is seen in verses 4-5: \u201cYou will not die. For God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like elohim, knowing good and evil.\u201d In other words, the serpent is portraying God as holding out on humanity, withholding knowledge and good things. Finally, in verse 6, the word \u201cdesirable\u201d (Heb. nekhmad, \u201cthe object of covetous desire\u201d) combines with the action \u201ctake.\u201d Humans become aware that there is something they can desire and take, presumably for their own benefit.</p>\n<p>Tim and Jon hypothesize that the tree is placed in the middle of the garden to represent that the human choice to do what is wrong is always in the center of our lives. We are always only one or two decisions away from ruining our lives and the lives of many others.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (15:00-26:45), Tim notes that humans don\u2019t know what to do with abundance. We bend abundance to hoard and act selfishly. Tim then pivots to the story of Cain and Abel. Jon explains that he feels God is more generous with Abel than with Cain. Tim says this seems to be an intentionally ambiguous gap in the narrative. Tim says he thinks Genesis is developing a theme of the \u2018mystery of election.\u2019 God does seem to choose or favor one person over another, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s at the complete expense of the other person.</p>\n<p>In Genesis 4, Cain\u2019s jealous anger at his brother compels him to take life instead of give. The narrative tells us in 4:2 that Cain was \u201ca worker of the ground\u201d but denies his role as a \u201ckeeper of his brother.\u201d This is why murder is such a heinous crime in the Scriptures: to take life gratuitously is to act as if it is yours to \u201ctake,\u201d rather than recognizing that your role as a human is to \u201cgive\u201d life and participate in its flourishing.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (26:45-end), Tim and Jon continue to discuss the Cain and Abel story and how the traits of \u201ctaking\u201d continues in the following stories in Genesis. In Genesis 6, the sons of elohim \u201csee\u201d the daughters of humanity are \u201cgood\u201d and they \u201ctake\u201d what they want. Then in Genesis 11 in the story of Babylon, the people say, \u201clet us build for ourselves a city and a tower, and it\u2019s head will be in the skies, and we will make a name for ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the story of Cain and Abel, Tim notes, God tells Cain that if he does good, he too will be exalted.

Then in Genesis 11 in the story of Babylon, the people say, \u201clet us build for ourselves a city and a tower, and it\u2019s head will be in the skies, and we will make a name for ourselves.\u201d\nIn the story of Cain and Abel, Tim notes, God tells Cain that if he does good, he too will be exalted. Instead, Cain chooses to take his brother\u2019s life, rejecting God\u2019s generosity and claiming the life of his brother.\nThank you to all our supporters!\nFind all our resources at www.thebibleproject.com\nShow Produced by:\nShow Music:\nPowered and distributed by Simplecast.",

Tim explains that generosity is both a theme and a concept that is found throughout the Scriptures.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (7:45-32:10), Tim shares from a famous passage in the gospel accounts.</p>\n<p>\u2028Luke 12:22-34\u2028<br />\n&quot;And He said to His disciples, 'For this reason I tell you, don\u2019t be anxious about your life, what you will eat; and don\u2019t be anxious about your body, what clothes you put on. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. Ponder the ravens, for they don\u2019t sow seed or reap a harvest; they have no storerooms or barns, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds! And which of you by worrying can add an hour to his life\u2019s span? And if you cannot do even a very little thing, why do you worry about other matters? Ponder the lilies, how they grow: they don\u2019t toil or spin clothes; but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you? You who trust God so little! And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and don\u2019t foster your anxiety. For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek; and your Father knows that you need these things. But seek His kingdom, and these things will be granted to you. Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions and give to the poor; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near nor moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.'&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim points out that freedom from anxiety is rooted in a conception of the universe, like a safe place where I\u2019m welcomed by a generous host. The same overabundance we see in nature comes from a Creator who shows that same generosity towards us. This mindset frees us from a scarcity mentality, releasing us to freely give resources to others. Jesus observed this not primarily as a religious principle but as one written on the DNA of the universe. Jesus sees the birds and flowers and grass and notices God\u2019s generosity and overabundant love.</p>\n<p>\u2028The words of Jesus sound almost irresponsible to Type A, hardworking people. Yet with these words, Jesus articulates a way of seeing the world rooted in the Hebrew Scriptures and their depiction of God\u2019s generosity. Tim notes that often we\u2019re the ones who need our eyes opened to see God\u2019s generosity in creation.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (32:10-36:30), Tim points out Jesus\u2019 view of creation, that God created a good world that always produces enough, as long as humans live in accordance with the image of God.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (36:30-53:20), Tim asks: What kind of tradition and culture did Jesus grown up in that allowed him to have this mindset? One passage Tim offers is Psalm 104:10-17 and 24-28:</p>\n<p>He sends forth springs in the valleys;<br />\nThey flow between the mountains;<br />\nThey give drink to every beast of the field;<br />\nThe wild donkeys quench their thirst.<br />\nBeside them the birds of the heavens dwell;<br />\nThey lift up their voices among the branches.<br />\nHe waters the mountains from His upper chambers;<br />\nThe earth is satisfied with the fruit of His works.<br />\nHe causes the grass to grow for the cattle,<br />\nAnd vegetation for the labor of man,<br />\nSo that he may bring forth food from the earth,<br />\nAnd wine which makes man\u2019s heart glad,<br />\nSo that he may make his face glisten with oil,<br />\nAnd food which sustains man\u2019s heart.<br />\nThe trees of the Lord drink their fill,<br />\nThe cedars of Lebanon which He planted,<br />\nWhere the birds build their nests,<br />\nAnd the stork, whose home is the fir trees.</p>\n<p>O Lord, how many are Your works!<br />\nIn wisdom You have made them all;<br />\nThe earth is full of Your possessions.<br />\nThere is the sea, great and broad,<br />\nIn which are swarms without number,<br />\nAnimals both small and great.<br />\nThere the ships move along,<br />\nAnd Leviathan, which You have formed to sport in it.<br />\nThey all wait for You<br />\nTo give them their food in due season.<br />\nYou give to them, they gather it up;<br />\nYou open Your hand, they are satisfied with good.</p>\n<p>\u2028Tim points out that this is a Psalm Jesus would have grown up hearing in synagogue. Jesus believed creation is an expression of the generous, creative love of God. Genesis 1-2 shows us that God brings order out of chaos (Gen. 1) and a garden out of a wasteland (Gen. 2). These God gives as a gift to humanity.</p>\n<p>One way of thinking of the biblical storyline, Tim points out, is as a story of giving and taking. Yahweh God creates a wonderful world, full of potential, and he gives it to humanity to rule with him through wisdom. Humanity then desires to rule on their own terms and takes creation for themselves.</p>\n<p>In part 5 (53:20-end), Tim points out the human problem, not only on a societal level, but on a heart level. By default, we act to benefit ourselves. In the midst of this, Tim notes, the Bible\u2019s view on wealth is complex. Jesus talks about wealth and money more than most topics\u2014a top-three subject of conversation.

You can read those questions with their timestamps below.</p>\n<p>Toonna from Canada (1:55):\u2028Hi, Tim and Jon. My name is Toonna and I am calling from Canada. I'm Nigerian, but I currently live in Canada. I just got done listening to the podcast of the tree of knowing good and bad. Towards the end of the podcast, I was really interested in the conversation around the fear of the Lord and wisdom, how Adam and Eve were afraid of God after they ate of the fruit of the tree of good and bad but not afraid before, enough to not eat of the fruit. So I was curious if you have any thoughts on how we as Christians today can be possessed or consumed by the fear of the Lord enough to not commit sin today. Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>Jan from Texas (21:10):\u2028I was especially interested in your commentary on the role of the woman as the 'ezer, implying that she's someone provided for the adam to address the &quot;not good&quot; situation of his being alone and which then allows him to fulfill his mission &quot;as designed&quot; (so to speak). I'm curious, though, about how to reconcile this with Paul's statements in 1 Corinthians 7 regarding his wish that church members would remain unmarried (as he is). Typically, I've been taught that Paul was better able to fulfill his mission because of his single status, which seems a little at odds with the ideas discussed in these recent podcasts. So my question is: What's the best/most accurate way to handle Paul's teachings, especially viewed through the lens of the wisdom literature in particular? I feel like there's probably something my 21st-century Western mind is missing.</p>\n<p>Wesley from California (45:45):\u2028Hi, Tim and Jon, this is Wesley from Chowchilla, California. In your video on the Books of Solomon, you mentioned that Ecclesiastes is like Solomon as an old man reflecting on his life. In 1 Kings 11, Solomon dies apostate as king. I've been reading Tremper Longman's New International Commentary on Ecclesiastes, and in it he argues that Solomon did not write Ecclesiastes but that Collette is taking on Solomon's persona to make his point. And he seems to abandon this persona after three chapters. Can I get your thoughts on this idea? Also, I just want to say that I love The Bible Project. Thank you for everything you guys do.</p>\n<p>Taylor from Tennessee (49:23):\u2028Hey guys, this is Taylor from Knoxville, Tennessee. I'm trying to gain a better understanding of wisdom, and it appears that the opposite of wisdom is doing what is right in your own eyes. It seems that that's the underlying theme of the book of Judges, and I was curious to see if there was any correlation or relationship that the authors try to make there with wisdom.</p>\n<p>Brad from Wisconsin (53:10):\u2028My question came up about midway through the series, and it has to do with David. Does he play any role in the Wisdom Literature of the Bible, or is the major theme of wisdom attributed to Solomon exclusively? I see Solomon's portrayal of wisdom to be a piece of what it means to be an image bearer. Does King David share a similar motif?</p>\n<p>Micah from Oregon (56:35):\u2028Hi, my name is Micah Sharp. I'm from Newberg, Oregon. Here's my question. If we're switching from the wisdom literature to the classification of the books of Solomon, where does the book of Job now fit in the wider Hebrew Bible? Thank you.</p>\n<p>Kayleigh from South Africa (1:02:47):\u2028My question is about the Song of Songs. I was wondering if there's a connection between the two lovers in the Song of Songs who never get to fully consummate their love for each other and the New Jerusalem as a bride of the Lamb in Revelation? Could this be, in a sense, when the two lovers get to completely unite with each other in Revelation? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Find out more at www.thebibleproject.com</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nOur video on How to Read the Books of Solomon: https://youtu.be/WJgt1vRkPbI<br />\nAn Obituary for Wisdom Literature by Will Kynes</p>\n<p>Show Music: Defender Instrumental by Tents</p>\n<p>Show Produced by: Dan Gummel</p>\n<p>Powered and distributed by Simplecast.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>In part 1 (0-24:15), Tim and Jon discuss the book of Ecclesiastes. This book can most easily be<br />\ndescribed as a portrait of \u201cfoolish Solomon,\u201d who looks back at his accomplishments as failure<br />\nand hevel.</p>\n<p>Tim points out that the start of the book begins by creating a \u201cSolomon-like\u201d persona.<br />\nEcclesiastes 1:1<br />\n\u201cThe words of the preacher son of David, king in Jerusalem...\u201d (NASB, ESV, KJV) \u201cThe words<br />\nof the teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem...\u201d (NIV, NRSV)<br />\nHowever, there is a translation problem: This word does not mean \u201cteacher\u201d in the original<br />\nHebrew. Hebrew noun (\u05e7\u05d4\u05dc\u05ea (qoheleth, from the verb qahal (\u05e7\u05d4\u05dc ,(meaning \u201cto assemble,<br />\nconvene.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Hebrew word is Qoheleth\u2014the one who holds or convenes an assembly, i.e. the \u201cleader of<br />\nthe assembly\u201d (Heb. qahal). So this word is best understood as an assembler or convener. The<br />\nword is also used in 1 Kings 8:1, \u201cThen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the<br />\nheads of the tribes... to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the city of David, which<br />\nis Zion. All the men of Israel assembled themselves to King Solomon at the feast.\u201d<br />\nTim\u2019s point is that there are multiple leaders who assemble or convene Israel in the Bible.<br />\nWho holds assemblies in Israel\u2019s story?<br />\n\u2022 Moses (Exod 35:1; Lev 8:1-3)<br />\n\u2022 David (1 Chron 13:5; 15:3; 28:1)<br />\n\u2022 Solomon (1 Kings 8:1; 2 Chron 5:2-3)<br />\n\u2022 Rehoboam (Solomon\u2019s son, 1 Kings 12:21; 2 Chron 11:1)<br />\n\u2022 Asa (2 Chron 15:9-10)<br />\n\u2022 Jehoshaphat (2 Chron 20:3-5)<br />\n\u2022 Hezekiah (2 Chron 30:12-13)</p>\n<p>Tim cites scholar Jennie Barbour for additional clarification:<br />\n\u201cThe name Qoheleth \u2018the one who convenes the assembly\u2019 is a label with royal associations\u2014<br />\nafter Moses, only kings summon all-Israelite assemblies, and those associations take in more<br />\nkings than just Solomon. Qoheleth\u2019s name casts him as a royal archetype, not an \u2018everyman\u2019 so<br />\nmuch as an \u2018everyking.\u2019\u201d (Jenny Barbour, The Story of Israel in the Book of Qoheleth, p. 25-26)<br />\nAny generation of Jerusalem\u2019s kings could be called \u201cson of David,\u201d and the author tips his hat<br />\nin Ecclesiastes 2:9, \u201cI increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.\u201d (And the only<br />\nperson who reigned before him in Jerusalem was his father David.)<br />\nTim explains that the jaded king-author of Ecclesiastes brings a realism in light of Genesis 3,<br />\nframing the world as life \u201cunder the sun,\u201d or life outside of Eden. This king is realizing the curse<br />\nof Genesis 3: painful toil and dust to dust.</p>\n<p>Tim further points out that Ecclesiastes offers a Solomon-like profile of the wealthy sons of<br />\nDavid, who discovered that riches, honor, power, and women do not bring the life of Eden.<br />\nFurther, while many people assume that the descriptions solely describe the life of Solomon,<br />\nTim points out that they also map very closely onto the life of Hezekiah.<br />\nTake a look at these two passages:</p>\n<p>Ecclesiastes 2:4-8 I made great my works: I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for<br />\nmyself; I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees; I made<br />\nponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees. I bought male and<br />\nfemale slaves and I had homeborn slaves. Also I possessed flocks and herds more abundant<br />\nthan all who preceded me in Jerusalem. Also, I collected for myself silver and gold and the<br />\ntreasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male and female singers and the<br />\npleasures of men\u2014many concubines.</p>\n<p>Hezekiah in 2 Chronicles 32:27-30 Now Hezekiah had immense riches and honor; and he<br />\nmade for himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of<br />\nvaluable articles, collection-houses also for the produce of grain, wine and oil, pens for all kinds<br />\nof cattle and sheepfolds for the flocks. He made cities for himself and acquired flocks and herds<br />\nin abundance, for God had given him very great wealth. It was Hezekiah who stopped the upper<br />\noutlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them to the west side of the city of David. And<br />\nHezekiah prospered in all his works.</p>\n<p>Tim cites Jennie Barbour again:<br />\n\u201cIn all of these ways [building projects, riches, royal treasuries, pools, singers] the royal boast<br />\nin Eccles. 2:4-10 displays a king\u2019s achievements in terms that show an author of the Second<br />\nTemple period reading an interpreting the earlier stories of Israel\u2019s kings...the writer has pulled<br />\ntogether texts and motifs from Israel\u2019s histories...to show that the paradigm king, Solomon, set<br />\nthe mould that was continually replicated through the rest of Israel\u2019s monarchy down to the<br />\nexile.\u201d (Jennie Barbour, The Story of Israel in the Book of Qoheleth, 23-24)<br />\nIn part 2 (24:15- 31:45), Jon asks how the narrative frame of Ecclesiastes being about all of<br />\nIsrael\u2019s kings\u2014not just about Solomon\u2014affects someone\u2019s reading? Tim says he thinks it<br />\nmakes the story more universal. All rulers and all humans struggle with the same things that<br />\nSolomon and other rulers have felt throughout history.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (31:45-50:15), Tim and Jon turn their attention to the book of Job. Tim notes that he\u2019s<br />\nrecently learned of some new and fascinating layers to the book. Tim notes that Job is<br />\npositioned as a new type of Adam. He actually is portrayed as being righteous and upright. So<br />\nhe\u2019s an ideal wise person who has prospered during his life. Tim focuses on the beginning and<br />\nend of the book. Specifically the ending of the book, Tim finds new insights to ponder.<br />\nTim notes that Job is portrayed as the righteous sufferer. Everything that has happened to him<br />\nis unfair. Then Tim dives into Job 42:7-10:<br />\n\u201cAnd it came about after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, and Yahweh said to Eliphaz<br />\nthe Temanite, \u201cMy anger is kindled against you and against your two friends, because you<br />\nhave not spoken of Me what is right as My servant Job has. \u201cAnd now, take for yourselves<br />\nseven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for<br />\nyourselves, and My servant Job will pray for you. For I will lift up his face so that I may not<br />\ncommit an outrage with you, because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant<br />\nJob has.\u201d So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went<br />\nand they did as Yahweh told them; and the Lord lifted the face of Job. And Yahweh restored<br />\nthe fortunes of Job while he prayed on behalf of his companions, and Yahweh added to<br />\neverything that belonged to Job, two-fold.\u201d</p>\n<p>The operative phrase Tim focuses on is \u201cwhile he prayed.\u201d Tim says this is a better translation of<br />\nthe original Hebrew phrase. Tim notes that it\u2019s as if Job\u2019s righteous suffering has uniquely<br />\npositioned him to intercede on behalf of his friends to God.<br />\nIn part 4, (50:15-60:00) Tim shares a few quotes from scholar David Clines regarding Job\u2019s<br />\nintercession in 42:10.</p>\n<p>\u201c[W]e must remember that Job has not yet been restored when the friends bring their request<br />\nto him for his prayer. He is presumably still on the ash-heap. He has no inkling that Yahweh</p>\n<p>intends to reverse his fortunes. All he knows is that he is still suffering at Yahweh\u2019s hand, and, if<br />\nit is difficult for the friends to acknowledge the divine judgment against them, it must be no less<br />\ndifficult for Job to accept this second-hand instruction to offer prayer for people he must be<br />\ntotally disenchanted with; he certainly owes them nothing... Is this yet another \u2018test\u2019 that Job<br />\nmust undergo before he is restored?<br />\n\u201cThe wording of Job 42:10 makes it seem as if Job\u2019s restoration is dependent on his prayer on their behalf, as if his last trial of all will be to take his stand on the side of his \u2018torturer-<br />\ncomforters.\u2019 It is true that this prayer is the first selfless act that Job has performed since his misfortunes overtook him\u2014not that we much begrudge him the self-centeredness that has<br />\ndominated his speech throughout the book. Perhaps his renewed orientation to the needs of<br />\nothers is the first sign that he has abandoned his inward-looking mourning and is ready to<br />\naccept consolation. In any case, in the very act of offering his prayer on the friends\u2019 behalf his<br />\nown restoration is said to take effect: the Hebrew says, \u201cYahweh restored the fortunes of Job<br />\nwhile he was praying for his friends\u201d (not, as most versions, \u201cwhen (or after) he had prayed for<br />\nhis friends\u201d).\u201d David J. A. Clines, Job 38\u201342, vol. 18B, Word Biblical Commentary (Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson, 2011), 1235.</p>\n<p>Tim notes that the point of the story of Job is that he suffers unfairly, but the righteous sufferer is<br />\nsomeone that God elevates to a place of authority, someone who God listens to when they<br />\nintercede for others.</p>\n<p>In part 5 (60:00-end), Tim and Jon briefly recap the series as a whole.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Send us your questions for our Wisdom Q+R!

This book can most easily be<br />\ndescribed as a portrait of \u201cfoolish Solomon,\u201d who looks back at his accomplishments as failure<br />\nand hevel.</p>\n<p>Tim points out that the start of the book begins by creating a \u201cSolomon-like\u201d persona.<br />\nEcclesiastes 1:1<br />\n\u201cThe words of the preacher son of David, king in Jerusalem...\u201d (NASB, ESV, KJV) \u201cThe words<br />\nof the teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem...\u201d (NIV, NRSV)<br />\nHowever, there is a translation problem: This word does not mean \u201cteacher\u201d in the original<br />\nHebrew. Hebrew noun (\u05e7\u05d4\u05dc\u05ea (qoheleth, from the verb qahal (\u05e7\u05d4\u05dc ,(meaning \u201cto assemble,<br />\nconvene.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Hebrew word is Qoheleth\u2014the one who holds or convenes an assembly, i.e. the \u201cleader of<br />\nthe assembly\u201d (Heb. qahal). So this word is best understood as an assembler or convener. The<br />\nword is also used in 1 Kings 8:1, \u201cThen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the<br />\nheads of the tribes... to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the city of David, which<br />\nis Zion. All the men of Israel assembled themselves to King Solomon at the feast.\u201d<br />\nTim\u2019s point is that there are multiple leaders who assemble or convene Israel in the Bible.<br />\nWho holds assemblies in Israel\u2019s story?<br />\n\u2022 Moses (Exod 35:1; Lev 8:1-3)<br />\n\u2022 David (1 Chron 13:5; 15:3; 28:1)<br />\n\u2022 Solomon (1 Kings 8:1; 2 Chron 5:2-3)<br />\n\u2022 Rehoboam (Solomon\u2019s son, 1 Kings 12:21; 2 Chron 11:1)<br />\n\u2022 Asa (2 Chron 15:9-10)<br />\n\u2022 Jehoshaphat (2 Chron 20:3-5)<br />\n\u2022 Hezekiah (2 Chron 30:12-13)</p>\n<p>Tim cites scholar Jennie Barbour for additional clarification:<br />\n\u201cThe name Qoheleth \u2018the one who convenes the assembly\u2019 is a label with royal associations\u2014<br />\nafter Moses, only kings summon all-Israelite assemblies, and those associations take in more<br />\nkings than just Solomon. Qoheleth\u2019s name casts him as a royal archetype, not an \u2018everyman\u2019 so<br />\nmuch as an \u2018everyking.\u2019\u201d (Jenny Barbour, The Story of Israel in the Book of Qoheleth, p. 25-26)<br />\nAny generation of Jerusalem\u2019s kings could be called \u201cson of David,\u201d and the author tips his hat<br />\nin Ecclesiastes 2:9, \u201cI increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.\u201d (And the only<br />\nperson who reigned before him in Jerusalem was his father David.)<br />\nTim explains that the jaded king-author of Ecclesiastes brings a realism in light of Genesis 3,<br />\nframing the world as life \u201cunder the sun,\u201d or life outside of Eden. This king is realizing the curse<br />\nof Genesis 3: painful toil and dust to dust.</p>\n<p>Tim further points out that Ecclesiastes offers a Solomon-like profile of the wealthy sons of<br />\nDavid, who discovered that riches, honor, power, and women do not bring the life of Eden.<br />\nFurther, while many people assume that the descriptions solely describe the life of Solomon,<br />\nTim points out that they also map very closely onto the life of Hezekiah.<br />\nTake a look at these two passages:</p>\n<p>Ecclesiastes 2:4-8 I made great my works: I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for<br />\nmyself; I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees; I made<br />\nponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees. I bought male and<br />\nfemale slaves and I had homeborn slaves. Also I possessed flocks and herds more abundant<br />\nthan all who preceded me in Jerusalem. Also, I collected for myself silver and gold and the<br />\ntreasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male and female singers and the<br />\npleasures of men\u2014many concubines.</p>\n<p>Hezekiah in 2 Chronicles 32:27-30 Now Hezekiah had immense riches and honor; and he<br />\nmade for himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of<br />\nvaluable articles, collection-houses also for the produce of grain, wine and oil, pens for all kinds<br />\nof cattle and sheepfolds for the flocks. He made cities for himself and acquired flocks and herds<br />\nin abundance, for God had given him very great wealth. It was Hezekiah who stopped the upper<br />\noutlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them to the west side of the city of David. And<br />\nHezekiah prospered in all his works.</p>\n<p>Tim cites Jennie Barbour again:<br />\n\u201cIn all of these ways [building projects, riches, royal treasuries, pools, singers] the royal boast<br />\nin Eccles. 2:4-10 displays a king\u2019s achievements in terms that show an author of the Second<br />\nTemple period reading an interpreting the earlier stories of Israel\u2019s kings...the writer has pulled<br />\ntogether texts and motifs from Israel\u2019s histories...to show that the paradigm king, Solomon, set<br />\nthe mould that was continually replicated through the rest of Israel\u2019s monarchy down to the<br />\nexile.\u201d (Jennie Barbour, The Story of Israel in the Book of Qoheleth, 23-24)<br />\nIn part 2 (24:15- 31:45), Jon asks how the narrative frame of Ecclesiastes being about all of<br />\nIsrael\u2019s kings\u2014not just about Solomon\u2014affects someone\u2019s reading? Tim says he thinks it<br />\nmakes the story more universal. All rulers and all humans struggle with the same things that<br />\nSolomon and other rulers have felt throughout history.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (31:45-50:15), Tim and Jon turn their attention to the book of Job. Tim notes that he\u2019s<br />\nrecently learned of some new and fascinating layers to the book. Tim notes that Job is<br />\npositioned as a new type of Adam. He actually is portrayed as being righteous and upright. So<br />\nhe\u2019s an ideal wise person who has prospered during his life. Tim focuses on the beginning and<br />\nend of the book. Specifically the ending of the book, Tim finds new insights to ponder.<br />\nTim notes that Job is portrayed as the righteous sufferer. Everything that has happened to him<br />\nis unfair. Then Tim dives into Job 42:7-10:<br />\n\u201cAnd it came about after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, and Yahweh said to Eliphaz<br />\nthe Temanite, \u201cMy anger is kindled against you and against your two friends, because you<br />\nhave not spoken of Me what is right as My servant Job has. \u201cAnd now, take for yourselves<br />\nseven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for<br />\nyourselves, and My servant Job will pray for you. For I will lift up his face so that I may not<br />\ncommit an outrage with you, because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant<br />\nJob has.\u201d So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went<br />\nand they did as Yahweh told them; and the Lord lifted the face of Job. And Yahweh restored<br />\nthe fortunes of Job while he prayed on behalf of his companions, and Yahweh added to<br />\neverything that belonged to Job, two-fold.\u201d</p>\n<p>The operative phrase Tim focuses on is \u201cwhile he prayed.\u201d Tim says this is a better translation of<br />\nthe original Hebrew phrase. Tim notes that it\u2019s as if Job\u2019s righteous suffering has uniquely<br />\npositioned him to intercede on behalf of his friends to God.<br />\nIn part 4, (50:15-60:00) Tim shares a few quotes from scholar David Clines regarding Job\u2019s<br />\nintercession in 42:10.</p>\n<p>\u201c[W]e must remember that Job has not yet been restored when the friends bring their request<br />\nto him for his prayer. He is presumably still on the ash-heap. He has no inkling that Yahweh</p>\n<p>intends to reverse his fortunes. All he knows is that he is still suffering at Yahweh\u2019s hand, and, if<br />\nit is difficult for the friends to acknowledge the divine judgment against them, it must be no less<br />\ndifficult for Job to accept this second-hand instruction to offer prayer for people he must be<br />\ntotally disenchanted with; he certainly owes them nothing... Is this yet another \u2018test\u2019 that Job<br />\nmust undergo before he is restored?<br />\n\u201cThe wording of Job 42:10 makes it seem as if Job\u2019s restoration is dependent on his prayer on their behalf, as if his last trial of all will be to take his stand on the side of his \u2018torturer-<br />\ncomforters.\u2019 It is true that this prayer is the first selfless act that Job has performed since his misfortunes overtook him\u2014not that we much begrudge him the self-centeredness that has<br />\ndominated his speech throughout the book. Perhaps his renewed orientation to the needs of<br />\nothers is the first sign that he has abandoned his inward-looking mourning and is ready to<br />\naccept consolation. In any case, in the very act of offering his prayer on the friends\u2019 behalf his<br />\nown restoration is said to take effect: the Hebrew says, \u201cYahweh restored the fortunes of Job<br />\nwhile he was praying for his friends\u201d (not, as most versions, \u201cwhen (or after) he had prayed for<br />\nhis friends\u201d).\u201d David J. A. Clines, Job 38\u201342, vol. 18B, Word Biblical Commentary (Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson, 2011), 1235.</p>\n<p>Tim notes that the point of the story of Job is that he suffers unfairly, but the righteous sufferer is<br />\nsomeone that God elevates to a place of authority, someone who God listens to when they<br />\nintercede for others.</p>\n<p>In part 5 (60:00-end), Tim and Jon briefly recap the series as a whole.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Send us your questions for our Wisdom Q+R!

Tim adds that multiple historical scholars note the double and triple meanings throughout the book.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (15:50-33:30), the guys dive into the book. Tim outlines a few basic facts about the book:\u00a0</p>\n<pre><code>\u2022\tThe poems go back and forth between a man and woman: The man is called \u201cking\u201d (1:4, 12) and \u201cshepherd\u201d (1:7).\n\u2022\tThe name \u201cSolomon\u201d is never marked as a speaker, and the main question is whether the lover (\u201cmy beloved\u201d), who is called \u201cking\u201d and \u201cshepherd,\u201d is Solomon or a distinct figure. Notice the word \u201cbeloved\u201d (dod, \u05d3\u05d5\u05d3), spelled with the same letters as \u201cDavid\u201d (\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3), who was both a king and shepherd (whereas Solomon was only a king).\n\u2022\tThe woman is called \u201cwhom I love\u201d and \u201cthe Shulamite\u201d (which is the feminine of Solomon\u2019s name. It would be similar in English to \u201cDaniel\u201d and \u201cDanielle\u201d).\n</code></pre>\n<p>Tim cites Roland Murphy:</p>\n<p>\u201cOn one level, the [Song of Songs] is a collection of love songs. However, as edited [to be part of the Hebrew Bible], do these poems have a wisdom-character on another level of understanding? First, there is the fact that ancient Jewish tradition...attributed this work to Solomon (Song 1:1)... it was mean to be read as a work in the Solomonic wisdom tradition\u2026 [T]here is an affinity between wisdom and eros in the wisdom literature. The quest for wisdom is a quest for the beloved\u2026. The language and imagery used to describe the pursuit of Lady Wisdom [in Proverbs 1-9] are drawn from the experience of love. The Song of Songs speaks of love between a man and a woman...it is by that very fact open to a wisdom interpretation. Wisdom is to be \u201cfound\u201d (Prov 3:13; 8:17, 35), just as one \u201cfinds\u201d a good wife (Prov 18:22; 31:10).... [Both] Wisdom and a wife are called \u201cfavor from the Lord\u201d (Prov 8:35 and 18:22). The sage advises the youth to \u201cobtain Wisdom,\u201d to love and embrace her (Prov 4:6-8). The youth is to say, \u201cWisdom, you are my sister\u201d (Prov 7:4), just as the beloved in the Song of Songs is called \u201cmy sister (Song 4:9-5:1)... It is precisely the link between eros and wisdom that opens the Song of Songs to another level of understanding. While it is not \u2018wisdom literature,\u2019 its echoes reach beyond human sexual love to remind one of the love of Lady Wisdom\u2026\u201d (Roland Murphy, The Tree of Life: An Exploration of Biblical Wisdom Literature, pp. 106-107.)</p>\n<p>In part 3 (33:30-47:00), Jon notes with this interpretation that the female character is the \u201cdivine\u201d character. In most popular interpretations, Solomon is closer to the Christ figure, and the woman is as the Church\u2014making the male the \u201cdivine\u201d character.</p>\n<p>Tim then dives into the literary design of the book. The Song is designed as a symmetry (see the work of Cheryl Exum and William Shea).</p>\n<p>The Literary Macrostructure of Song of Songs:</p>\n<p>1:2-2:7 Mutual Love\u2028B. 2:8-17 Coming and Going<br />\nC. 3:1-5 Dream 1: Lost and Found<br />\nD. 3:6-11 Praise of Groom 1\u2028E. 4:1-7 Praise of Bride 1\u2028F. 4:8-15 Praise of Bride 2<br />\nG. 4:16 Invitation by Bride\u2028G.

Davidson)</p>\n<p>Tim points out that the first half explores the engagement, passion, and constant desire and pursuit of the lovers, though their embrace is cut short multiple times. The second half mirrors the first, but this time it depicts the royal wedding of Solomon and his Solomon-ess bride. The beloved is described in precisely the language of Lady Wisdom in Proverbs 1-9, the God-given wife in Proverbs 5, and the woman of valor in Proverbs 31 (see Claudia Camp, Wisdom and the Feminine in the Book of Proverbs).</p>\n<p>Verses like this can show how the corresponding language maps onto each other.</p>\n<p>Lady Wisdom in Proverbs\u2028\u2028Proverbs 4:5-9\u2028\u201cAcquire wisdom! Acquire understanding!\u2028Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.\u2028Do not forsake her, and she will guard you;\u2028Love her, and she will watch over you.\u2028The beginning of wisdom is: Acquire wisdom;\u2028And with all your acquiring, get understanding.\u2028Prize her, and she will exalt you;\u2028She will honor you if you embrace her.\u2028She will place on your head a garland of grace;\u2028She will present you with a crown of beauty.\u201d\u2028<br />\nThe Beloved in Song of Songs<br />\nSong 2:3-4, 6\u2028\u201cLike an apple tree among the trees of the forest,\u2028So is my beloved among the young men.\u2028In his shade I took great delight and sat down,\u2028And his fruit was sweet to my taste.\u2028He has brought me to his banquet hall,\u2028And his banner over me is love\u2026.\u2028Let his left hand be under my head\u2028And his right hand embrace me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Song 3:11\u2028\u201cGo forth, O daughters of Zion,\u2028And gaze on King Solomon with the crown\u2028With which his mother has crowned him\u2028On the day of his wedding,\u2028And on the day of his gladness of heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim notes that conversely, the beloved is also described in the language of the wayward woman in Proverbs 1-9.<br />\n\u2028Wayward woman of Proverbs 1-9<br />\n\u2028Proverbs 5:3<br />\n\u201cFor the lips of the strange woman drip with honey (\u05e0\u05e4\u05ea \u05ea\u05d8\u05e4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d6\u05e8\u05d4), and her mouth (\u05d7\u05da) is smoother than oil.\u201d<br />\n\u2028Proverbs 7:6, 8\u2028\u201cThe strange woman... the foreign woman whose words are smooth\u2026 A man passes through the street (\u05e9\u05d5\u05e7), and takes the way (\u05d3\u05e8\u05da) to her house.<br />\n\u2028Proverbs 7:13, 15, 17\u2028\u201cShe grabs him and kisses him\u2026 \u2018Therefore I have come out to meet you, to seek your presence earnestly, and I have found you\u2026. I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloe, and cinnamon.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Compare those verses with the beloved in Song of Songs.<br />\n\u2028Song 4:11<br />\n\u201cO bride, your lips drip with honey (\u05e0\u05e4\u05ea \u05ea\u05d8\u05e4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05da), honey and fat are under your tongue\u2026\u201d\u2028<br />\nSong 3:2\u2028\u201cI arose and went around in the city, in the streets and squares, I sought the one my being loves\u2026\u201d\u2028<br />\nSongs 3:1, 4\u2028\u201cOn my bed at night, I sought the one my being loves, I sought him but could not find him\u2026 No sooner did I pass by them, then I found the one my being loves, and grabbed him and I did not let go\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Songs 1:16<br />\n\u201cBehold, your beauty my companion...behold your beauty my beloved, so lovely, indeed our couch is luxuriant.\u201d</p>\n<p>What is the point? It\u2019s as if the beloved represented the healing of the wayward woman into one ultimate lover. The ideal Solomon is converted from a lover of many women into a lover of one, reversing the fall of Adam and Eve, Yahweh and Israel, Solomon and his many wives. Lady Wisdom (who we met in Proverbs) is finally embraced by the son of David. She is constantly searching for her lover (as Lady Wisdom searches in Prov. 1-9).</p>\n<p>In part 4 (47:00-52:30), Jon comments that to him, the human sexual drive is confusing, especially when viewed in a Christian lens. How do you map a biological longing for sex onto a book like Song of Songs?<br />\n\u2028Tim says that the desire is sexual, but it\u2019s also more than sexual. It\u2019s a desire to know and be known., to become one with something and someone. It\u2019s a desire for unity. Humanity\u2019s desire for sex, Tim compares, is analogous to our desire for wisdom and unity.</p>\n<p>In part 5 (52:30-end), Tim cites scholar Peter Leithart as a helpful resource to learn more about Song of Songs. Tim closes the episode with a quote from scholar Ellen Davis:<br />\n\u2028\u201cLoss of intimacy is exactly what happened in Eden. Eden was the place where God was most intimate with humanity. Witness God \u201ctaking a walk in the garden in the breezy part of the day\u201d (Gen. 3:8), obviously expecting to have the humans for company, and calling out\u2014\u201cWhere are you?\u201d\u2014when they do not appear. There is good reason to imagine that God intended to impart wisdom to humanity on those walks, little by little. But when Eve and Adam disregarded God and tried the direct route to \u201cknowledge of good and evil,\u201d the immediate result was not literal death. Rather, it was distrust breaking into the relationship between God and humanity. It was blame erupting between man and woman (Gen. 3:12) and the onset of a long-term imbalance of power between them (Gen. 3:16). It was a curse on the fertile soil and enmity between the woman\u2019s seed and the snake\u2019s (Gen. 3:15, 17).... The exile from Eden represents the loss of intimacy in three primary spheres of relationship: between God and humanity, between woman and man, and between human and nonhuman creation. Correspondingly, the Song uses language to evoke a vision of healing in all three areas. More accurately, it reuses language from other parts of Scripture; verbal echoes explicitly connect the garden of the lovers with the two earlier gardens, that of Eden and of Israel\u2019s temple.\u201d (Ellen Davis, \u201cReading the Song of Songs Iconographically,\u201d pg. 179)</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Show Resources:\u00a0<br />\n\u2022\tPeter Leithart Podcasts on Song of Songs (https://www.theopolispodcast.com/episodes)<br />\n\u2022\tEllen Davis, \u201cReading the Song of Songs Iconographically\u201d<br />\n\u2022\tClaudia Camp, Wisdom and the Feminine in the Book of Proverbs<br />\n\u2022\tCheryl Exum, Song of Songs: A Commentary<br />\n\u2022\tRoland Murphy, The Tree of Life: An Exploration of Biblical Wisdom Literature</p>\n<p>Show Music:\u00a0<br />\n\u2022\tDefender Instrumental by Tents<br />\n\u2022\tIdentity by B-Side<br />\n\u2022\talbatros by plusma<br />\n\u2022\tfaces by knowmadic<br />\n\u2022\tAerocity by Cold Weather Kids<br />\n\u2022\tSome music brought to you by the generous folks at chillhop music.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "In part 1(0-15:50), the guys discuss the first major question about this book: Is Song of Songs truly wisdom literature?\nTim notes that there are multiple levels of interpretation. The most obvious one views Song of Songs as semi-erotic love poetry. While this isn\u2019t wrong, Tim notes that a deeper reading can metaphorically map the man and woman\u2019s sexual love for one another onto the human pursuit and quest for wisdom.\nJon says that this view of interpreting Song of Songs is new to him. The reason, Tim notes, is because modern biblical scholarship often tends to see only what it wants to see. Tim adds that multiple historical scholars note the double and triple meanings throughout the book.\nIn part 2 (15:50-33:30), the guys dive into the book. Tim outlines a few basic facts about the book:\u00a0\n\u2022\tThe poems go back and forth between a man and woman: The man is called \u201cking\u201d (1:4, 12) and \u201cshepherd\u201d (1:7).\n\u2022\tThe name \u201cSolomon\u201d is never marked as a speaker, and the main question is whether the lover (\u201cmy beloved\u201d), who is called \u201cking\u201d and \u201cshepherd,\u201d is Solomon or a distinct figure. Notice the word \u201cbeloved\u201d (dod, \u05d3\u05d5\u05d3), spelled with the same letters as \u201cDavid\u201d (\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3), who was both a king and shepherd (whereas Solomon was only a king).\n\u2022\tThe woman is called \u201cwhom I love\u201d and \u201cthe Shulamite\u201d (which is the feminine of Solomon\u2019s name.

The Song is designed as a symmetry (see the work of Cheryl Exum and William Shea).\nThe Literary Macrostructure of Song of Songs:\n1:2-2:7 Mutual Love\u2028B. 2:8-17 Coming and Going\nC. 3:1-5 Dream 1: Lost and Found\nD. 3:6-11 Praise of Groom 1\u2028E. 4:1-7 Praise of Bride 1\u2028F. 4:8-15 Praise of Bride 2\nG. 4:16 Invitation by Bride\u2028G. Acceptance and Invitation by Groom and Divine Approbation\nC. 5:2-8 Dream 2: Found and Lost\nD. 5:9-6:3 Praise of Groom 2\nE. 6:4-12 Praise of Bride 3\nF. 7:1 Praise of Bride 4\nB. 7:11-8:2 Going and Coming\u20288:3-14 Mutual Love\n(Chart by Richard M. Davidson)\nTim points out that the first half explores the engagement, passion, and constant desire and pursuit of the lovers, though their embrace is cut short multiple times. The second half mirrors the first, but this time it depicts the royal wedding of Solomon and his Solomon-ess bride. The beloved is described in precisely the language of Lady Wisdom in Proverbs 1-9, the God-given wife in Proverbs 5, and the woman of valor in Proverbs 31 (see Claudia Camp, Wisdom and the Feminine in the Book of Proverbs).\nVerses like this can show how the corresponding language maps onto each other.\nLady Wisdom in Proverbs\u2028\u2028Proverbs 4:5-9\u2028\u201cAcquire wisdom! Acquire understanding!\u2028Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.\u2028Do not forsake her, and she will guard you;\u2028Love her, and she will watch over you.\u2028The beginning of wisdom is: Acquire wisdom;\u2028And with all your acquiring, get understanding.\u2028Prize her, and she will exalt you;\u2028She will honor you if you embrace her.\u2028She will place on your head a garland of grace;\u2028She will present you with a crown of beauty.\u201d\u2028\nThe Beloved in Song of Songs\nSong 2:3-4, 6\u2028\u201cLike an apple tree among the trees of the forest,\u2028So is my beloved among the young men.\u2028In his shade I took great delight and sat down,\u2028And his fruit was sweet to my taste.\u2028He has brought me to his banquet hall,\u2028And his banner over me is love\u2026.\u2028Let his left hand be under my head\u2028And his right hand embrace me.\u201d\nSong 3:11\u2028\u201cGo forth, O daughters of Zion,\u2028And gaze on King Solomon with the crown\u2028With which his mother has crowned him\u2028On the day of his wedding,\u2028And on the day of his gladness of heart.\u201d\nTim notes that conversely, the beloved is also described in the language of the wayward woman in Proverbs 1-9.\n\u2028Wayward woman of Proverbs 1-9\n\u2028Proverbs 5:3\n\u201cFor the lips of the strange woman drip with honey (\u05e0\u05e4\u05ea \u05ea\u05d8\u05e4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d6\u05e8\u05d4), and her mouth (\u05d7\u05da) is smoother than oil.\u201d\n\u2028Proverbs 7:6, 8\u2028\u201cThe strange woman... the foreign woman whose words are smooth\u2026 A man passes through the street (\u05e9\u05d5\u05e7), and takes the way (\u05d3\u05e8\u05da) to her house.\n\u2028Proverbs 7:13, 15, 17\u2028\u201cShe grabs him and kisses him\u2026 \u2018Therefore I have come out to meet you, to seek your presence earnestly, and I have found you\u2026. I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloe, and cinnamon.\u2019\u201d\nCompare those verses with the beloved in Song of Songs.\n\u2028Song 4:11\n\u201cO bride, your lips drip with honey (\u05e0\u05e4\u05ea \u05ea\u05d8\u05e4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05da), honey and fat are under your tongue\u2026\u201d\u2028\nSong 3:2\u2028\u201cI arose and went around in the city, in the streets and squares, I sought the one my being loves\u2026\u201d\u2028\nSongs 3:1, 4\u2028\u201cOn my bed at night, I sought the one my being loves, I sought him but could not find him\u2026 No sooner did I pass by them, then I found the one my being loves, and grabbed him and I did not let go\u2026.\u201d\nSongs 1:16\nWhat is the point? It\u2019s as if the beloved represented the healing of the wayward woman into one ultimate lover. The ideal Solomon is converted from a lover of many women into a lover of one, reversing the fall of Adam and Eve, Yahweh and Israel, Solomon and his many wives. Lady Wisdom (who we met in Proverbs) is finally embraced by the son of David. She is constantly searching for her lover (as Lady Wisdom searches in Prov. 1-9).\nIn part 4 (47:00-52:30), Jon comments that to him, the human sexual drive is confusing, especially when viewed in a Christian lens. How do you map a biological longing for sex onto a book like Song of Songs?\n\u2028Tim says that the desire is sexual, but it\u2019s also more than sexual. It\u2019s a desire to know and be known., to become one with something and someone. It\u2019s a desire for unity. Humanity\u2019s desire for sex, Tim compares, is analogous to our desire for wisdom and unity.\nIn part 5 (52:30-end), Tim cites scholar Peter Leithart as a helpful resource to learn more about Song of Songs. Tim closes the episode with a quote from scholar Ellen Davis:\n\u2028\u201cLoss of intimacy is exactly what happened in Eden. Eden was the place where God was most intimate with humanity. Witness God \u201ctaking a walk in the garden in the breezy part of the day\u201d (Gen. 3:8), obviously expecting to have the humans for company, and calling out\u2014\u201cWhere are you?\u201d\u2014when they do not appear. There is good reason to imagine that God intended to impart wisdom to humanity on those walks, little by little. But when Eve and Adam disregarded God and tried the direct route to \u201cknowledge of good and evil,\u201d the immediate result was not literal death. Rather, it was distrust breaking into the relationship between God and humanity. It was blame erupting between man and woman (Gen. 3:12) and the onset of a long-term imbalance of power between them (Gen. 3:16). It was a curse on the fertile soil and enmity between the woman\u2019s seed and the snake\u2019s (Gen. 3:15, 17).... The exile from Eden represents the loss of intimacy in three primary spheres of relationship: between God and humanity, between woman and man, and between human and nonhuman creation. Correspondingly, the Song uses language to evoke a vision of healing in all three areas. More accurately, it reuses language from other parts of Scripture; verbal echoes explicitly connect the garden of the lovers with the two earlier gardens, that of Eden and of Israel\u2019s temple.\u201d (Ellen Davis, \u201cReading the Song of Songs Iconographically,\u201d pg. 179)\nThank you to all our supporters!\nShow Resources:\u00a0\nShow Music:\u00a0\nShow Produced by: Dan Gummel, Jon Collins\nPowered and distributed by Simplecast.",

The question is, will humans rule wisely or foolishly?</p>\n<p>In part 2 (17:45-27:00), Tim and Jon discuss how Proverbs lays out two paths, which are the same two paths outlined in Genesis.

This maps onto the Garden of Eden narrative. Tim says that the book of Proverbs is designed to be a reflection on Genesis 1-3.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (39:00-end), Tim outlines Proverbs 31. Tim notes that the woman outlined here could be said to be a sort of real-life version of the metaphoric \u201cLady Wisdom\u201d depicted earlier in the book.

            "content": "<p>Welcome to our third episode discussing the theme of Wisdom in the bible.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Tim and Jon zoom in on the character Solomon. Was Solomon really the wisest person who ever lived?</p>\n<p>In part 1 (0-8:30), Tim and Jon quickly recap the conversation so far. Tim explains how the English word \u201chelp\u201d is inadequate when used to describe Eve\u2019s or woman\u2019s role in relationship to Adam. Instead of an unnecessary addition, it\u2019s more of an essential completion, even a \u201csaving\u201d role that the woman fills. Tim also explains that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil isn\u2019t the perfect translation in the Hebrew. More accurately, it\u2019s \u201cthe knowledge of the tree of good and bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part 2 (8:30-19:20), Tim begins to trace the human story after Adam and Eve, through Abraham and arriving at Solomon. Tim says that God promises to restore the blessing of Eden to all humanity through the family of Abraham.</p>\n<p>Here is God\u2019s promise to Abraham:</p>\n<p>Genesis 12:1-3<br />\n\u201cAnd I will make of you a great nation,\u2028and I will bless you,\u2028and make your name great,\u2028so that you will be a blessing.\u2028I will bless those who bless you,\u2028and him who curses you I will curse;\u2028and in you will be blessed all the families of the earth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Genesis 12:7<br />\n\u201cThe Lord appeared to Abram and said, \u2018To your seed I will give this land.\u2019 So he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him.\u201d<br />\n\u2028In Genesis 16, God promises Abraham and Sarah seed and land to be a blessing to the nations. But when they\u2019re unable to have a child, they turn to their own wisdom and power. This is a clear design pattern from the fall narrative of Genesis 3. See below the breakdown of this passage and it\u2019s reflection of the the Eden story.</p>\n<p>Genesis 16:1-2 tells us, \u201cSarai, Abram\u2019s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar.\u201d So Sarai says to Abram, \u201cGo now into my female servant, perhaps I will be built up from her.\u201d</p>\n<p>(This language of being \u201cbuilt\u201d from Hagar suspiciously reminds us of Genesis 2:22, \u201cand Yahweh God built the side which he took from the human into a woman, and he brought her to the man.\u201d)<br />\n\u2028Genesis 16:2b<br />\n\u201c\u2026and Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.\u201d</p>\n<p>(In Genesis 3:17, God says to Adam, \u201cBecause you listened to the voice of your wife\u2026\u201d)<br />\n\u2028Genesis 16:3-4<br />\n\u201cSarai, the wife of Abram, took Hagar the Egyptian her female slave\u2026 and she gave her to Abram her husband as a wife (Gen. 3:6, \u201cand she gave also to her husband with her\u201d). And he went into her and she became pregnant and she saw that (\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8\u05d0 \u05db\u05d9) she was pregnant, and her mistress became less in her eyes\u201d (Gen. 3:6, \u201cWhen the woman saw that [\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8\u05d0] the tree was good\u2026\u201d).<br />\n\u2028Genesis 16:6<br />\n\u201cAnd Abram said to Sarai, \u2018Look, your female slave is in your hand. Do to her what is good in your eyes (\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05da).\u2019</p>\n<p>(Gen. 3:6, \u201cWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes\u2026\u201d).<br />\n\u2028Genesis 16:6b-7<br />\n\u201cSo Sarah oppressed her, and Hagar fled from before her. And the angel of Yahweh found her by a spring of waters in the wilderness.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Gen. 3:24, \u201cSo [God] drove the man out\u2026.\u201d)</p>\n<p>In Genesis 22, when God provides a son from Sarah, God demands his life. God does not take lightly to the oppression of Egyptian slaves (the entire Exodus slavery is an inverted consequence for this sin). Also because of this sin, Ishmael is cast out from Abraham\u2019s family, which grieves God, so he demands that Abraham give Isaac back to him.</p>\n<p>God is looking for people who will trust Yahweh\u2019s word and command over their own wisdom, that will reverse the folly and fear of Adam and Eve. The first character to demonstrate this Abraham in Genesis 22:4-6:</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Abraham lifted his eyes (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5) and he saw (\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0)\u2026 and he took (\u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05d7) in his hand the fire and the knife/eater(\u05de\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05ea), and the two of them (\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd) walked on together (\u05d9\u05d7\u05d3\u05d5).\u201d</p>\n<p>This releases the blessing of Eden through Abraham\u2019s fear of Yahweh out into the nations.<br />\n\u2028Genesis 22:15-18\u2028&quot;Then the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, and said, \u201cBy Myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son, indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies. In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have listened My voice.\u201d</p>\n<p>The point is this: When humans don\u2019t live by their own wisdom regarding good and bad, but instead trust God\u2019s wisdom and obey his commands (the fear of the Lord), it leads to blessing and life. This is true wisdom: to live in the fear of the Lord.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (19:20-36:45), Tim begins to outline the story of Solomon.</p>\n<p>Tim says Solomon is presented as a new Adam. He has an opportunity to rule the world, and he actually asks God to give him wisdom to rule. Solomon is a complex character, depicted as both a new, ideal Adam\u2014but also as a failed, foolish Adam. In one narrative thread, he is depicted as a new Adam/Abraham, meeting God in a new high-place, and living by God\u2019s wisdom/Torah.</p>\n<p>1 Kings 3:3-15<br />\n\u201cNow Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of his father David... The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place; Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night; and God said, \u2018Ask what you wish me to give you.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cThen Solomon said, \u2018You have shown great covenant love to Your servant David my father...You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. Now, O Lord my God, You have made Your servant king in place of my father David, yet I am but a little child; I do not know to go out or come in.\u2028<br />\n\u201c\u2018Your servant is in the midst of Your people which You have chosen, a great people who are too many to be numbered or counted. So give Your servant a heart that listens in order to govern Your people, in order to discern between good (Heb. tov) and bad (Heb. ra\u2019). For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?\u2019\u201d<br />\n\u2028\u201cIt was good (tov) in the eyes of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing. God said to him, \u2018Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself discernment to hear justice, behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given you a heart of wisdom and discernment, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you. I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days. If you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days.\u2019 Then Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim shows how Solomon was blessed after he began to walk in the fear of the lord.</p>\n<p>1 Kings 4:20-21, 25, 29-34\u2028\u201cJudah and Israel were as numerous as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance; they were eating and drinking and rejoicing. Now Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; they brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life\u2026.\u201d<br />\n\u2028\u201cSo Judah and Israel lived in safety, every man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.\u201d<br />\n\u2028\u201cNow God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of mind, like the sand that is on the seashore. Solomon\u2019s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was known in all the surrounding nations. He also spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs were 1,005. He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he spoke also of beasts and birds and creepers and fish (do you hear Genesis 1 in there?). Men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.&quot;</p>\n<p>Solomon is portrayed as a new Adam, wisely ruling a garden with trees for everyone, fruitful and multiplying, boundaries expanded to Eden-like proportions. He knows the plants, beasts, birds, and creepers. He is more wise than \u201call the sons of the East\u201d (link to the book of Job). He spoke thousands of proverbs (link to the book of Proverbs). He wrote over a thousand songs (link to Song of Songs).\u2028<br />\nTim\u2019s point is that Solomon is beginning to to fulfill the original call of mankind to rule wisely. However, Solomon\u2019s story has another side as well.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (36:45-52:50), Tim outlines the foolish side of Solomon\u2019s life. Solomon enslaved people to help him build Jerusalem up. He imported and exported arms, chariots and horses to other countries. He had hundreds of wives and concubines. Solomon demonstrates wisdom but isn\u2019t fully committed to following the laws of Yahweh.</p>\n<p>1 Kings 5:13-17\u2028\u201cNow King Solomon levied forced laborers from all Israel; and the forced laborers numbered 30,000 men. He sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in relays; they were in Lebanon a month and two months at home. And Adoniram was over the forced laborers. Now Solomon had 70,000 transporters, and 80,000 hewers of stone in the mountains, besides Solomon\u2019s 3,300 chief deputies who were over the project and who ruled over the people who were doing the work. Then the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones.\u201d</p>\n<p>1 Kings 9:17, 19\u2028\u201cSo Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon... and all the storage cities which Solomon had, even the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Solomon, for all his wisdom, implemented policies which directly violated the laws of the king as outlined in the Torah.</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 17:15-20\u2028\u201cyou shall surely set a king over you whom Yahweh your God chooses, one from among your countrymen you shall set as king over yourselves; you may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your countryman. Moreover, he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, since Yahweh has said to you, \u2018You shall never again return that way.\u2019 He shall not multiply wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away; nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself.<br />\n\u2028\u201cNow it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this Torah on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. It shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God, by carefully observing all the words of this law and these statutes, that his heart may not be lifted up above his brothers and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or the left, so that he and his sons may continue long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel.</p>\n<p>Tim has found scholar Daniel Hays to be helpful here:</p>\n<p>\u201cWe as readers are given a tour of a fantastic, spectacular and opulent mansion, the house of Solomon. Everywhere we look we see wealth and abundance. However, without changing the inflection of his voice the tour guide also points out places where the fa\u00e7ade has cracked, revealing a very different structure. Continuing with the standard speech which glorifies the building, the guide nonetheless makes frequent side comments (forced labor, store cities, horses from Egypt, foreign marriages) that make clear that his glowing praise for the structure is not really his honest opinion of the facility, and he wants us also to see the truth. Finally, at the end of the tour in chapters 11, he can restrain himself no more, and he tells us plainly that the building is basically a fraud, covered with a thin veneer of glitz and hoopla, and soon will collapse under its own weight. This is the manner in which the narrator of 1 Kings leads us on a tour of the House of Solomon.\u201d (Daniel Hays, \u201cNarrative Subtlety in 1 Kings 1-11: Does the narrative praise or bury Solomon?\u201d)</p>\n<p>Tim points out that Solomon violates every rule that Israel\u2019s king was supposed to follow. A Bible reader should ask why the narrator is giving us a dual portrait of Solomon?</p>\n<p>In the New Testament, Jesus says, \u201csomething greater than Solomon is here.\u201d (Matthew 12:42; Luke 11:31). Jesus positioned himself as the true example of the ideal human who learns wisdom correctly by learning from Yahweh God.</p>\n<p>In part 5 (52:50-end), the guys discuss the seeming asymmetry of male and female portrayals in the Bible. Why is it that a woman is portrayed as a \u201cwise and foolish woman\u201d in Proverbs? Why are women often portrayed with seductive and illicit behavior?</p>\n<p>Tim points out that throughout history, men have been the ones translating the Bible, so they have default and built-in blind spots to understanding and accurately portraying a better view of man and woman\u2019s portrayal in the original Hebrew context.<br />\n\u2028Tim notes that women have been making great strides in contributing to and furthering academic and scholastic work on biblical texts and that their voices need to be heard.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Show Resources:\u00a0<br />\n\u2022\twww.thebibleproject.com<br />\n\u2022\tJ.

            "content:encoded": "<p>Welcome to our third episode discussing the theme of Wisdom in the bible.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Tim and Jon zoom in on the character Solomon. Was Solomon really the wisest person who ever lived?</p>\n<p>In part 1 (0-8:30), Tim and Jon quickly recap the conversation so far. Tim explains how the English word \u201chelp\u201d is inadequate when used to describe Eve\u2019s or woman\u2019s role in relationship to Adam. Instead of an unnecessary addition, it\u2019s more of an essential completion, even a \u201csaving\u201d role that the woman fills. Tim also explains that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil isn\u2019t the perfect translation in the Hebrew. More accurately, it\u2019s \u201cthe knowledge of the tree of good and bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part 2 (8:30-19:20), Tim begins to trace the human story after Adam and Eve, through Abraham and arriving at Solomon. Tim says that God promises to restore the blessing of Eden to all humanity through the family of Abraham.</p>\n<p>Here is God\u2019s promise to Abraham:</p>\n<p>Genesis 12:1-3<br />\n\u201cAnd I will make of you a great nation,\u2028and I will bless you,\u2028and make your name great,\u2028so that you will be a blessing.\u2028I will bless those who bless you,\u2028and him who curses you I will curse;\u2028and in you will be blessed all the families of the earth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Genesis 12:7<br />\n\u201cThe Lord appeared to Abram and said, \u2018To your seed I will give this land.\u2019 So he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him.\u201d<br />\n\u2028In Genesis 16, God promises Abraham and Sarah seed and land to be a blessing to the nations. But when they\u2019re unable to have a child, they turn to their own wisdom and power. This is a clear design pattern from the fall narrative of Genesis 3. See below the breakdown of this passage and it\u2019s reflection of the the Eden story.</p>\n<p>Genesis 16:1-2 tells us, \u201cSarai, Abram\u2019s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar.\u201d So Sarai says to Abram, \u201cGo now into my female servant, perhaps I will be built up from her.\u201d</p>\n<p>(This language of being \u201cbuilt\u201d from Hagar suspiciously reminds us of Genesis 2:22, \u201cand Yahweh God built the side which he took from the human into a woman, and he brought her to the man.\u201d)<br />\n\u2028Genesis 16:2b<br />\n\u201c\u2026and Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.\u201d</p>\n<p>(In Genesis 3:17, God says to Adam, \u201cBecause you listened to the voice of your wife\u2026\u201d)<br />\n\u2028Genesis 16:3-4<br />\n\u201cSarai, the wife of Abram, took Hagar the Egyptian her female slave\u2026 and she gave her to Abram her husband as a wife (Gen. 3:6, \u201cand she gave also to her husband with her\u201d). And he went into her and she became pregnant and she saw that (\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8\u05d0 \u05db\u05d9) she was pregnant, and her mistress became less in her eyes\u201d (Gen. 3:6, \u201cWhen the woman saw that [\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8\u05d0] the tree was good\u2026\u201d).<br />\n\u2028Genesis 16:6<br />\n\u201cAnd Abram said to Sarai, \u2018Look, your female slave is in your hand. Do to her what is good in your eyes (\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05da).\u2019</p>\n<p>(Gen. 3:6, \u201cWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes\u2026\u201d).<br />\n\u2028Genesis 16:6b-7<br />\n\u201cSo Sarah oppressed her, and Hagar fled from before her. And the angel of Yahweh found her by a spring of waters in the wilderness.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Gen. 3:24, \u201cSo [God] drove the man out\u2026.\u201d)</p>\n<p>In Genesis 22, when God provides a son from Sarah, God demands his life.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Welcome to our third episode discussing the theme of Wisdom in the bible.\nIn this episode, Tim and Jon zoom in on the character Solomon. Was Solomon really the wisest person who ever lived?\nIn part 1 (0-8:30), Tim and Jon quickly recap the conversation so far. Tim explains how the English word \u201chelp\u201d is inadequate when used to describe Eve\u2019s or woman\u2019s role in relationship to Adam. Instead of an unnecessary addition, it\u2019s more of an essential completion, even a \u201csaving\u201d role that the woman fills. Tim also explains that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil isn\u2019t the perfect translation in the Hebrew. More accurately, it\u2019s \u201cthe knowledge of the tree of good and bad.\u201d\nIn part 2 (8:30-19:20), Tim begins to trace the human story after Adam and Eve, through Abraham and arriving at Solomon. Tim says that God promises to restore the blessing of Eden to all humanity through the family of Abraham.\nHere is God\u2019s promise to Abraham:\nGenesis 12:1-3\n\u201cAnd I will make of you a great nation,\u2028and I will bless you,\u2028and make your name great,\u2028so that you will be a blessing.\u2028I will bless those who bless you,\u2028and him who curses you I will curse;\u2028and in you will be blessed all the families of the earth.\u201d\nGenesis 12:7\n\u201cThe Lord appeared to Abram and said, \u2018To your seed I will give this land.\u2019 So he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him.\u201d\n\u2028In Genesis 16, God promises Abraham and Sarah seed and land to be a blessing to the nations. But when they\u2019re unable to have a child, they turn to their own wisdom and power. This is a clear design pattern from the fall narrative of Genesis 3. See below the breakdown of this passage and it\u2019s reflection of the the Eden story.\nGenesis 16:1-2 tells us, \u201cSarai, Abram\u2019s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar.\u201d So Sarai says to Abram, \u201cGo now into my female servant, perhaps I will be built up from her.\u201d\n(This language of being \u201cbuilt\u201d from Hagar suspiciously reminds us of Genesis 2:22, \u201cand Yahweh God built the side which he took from the human into a woman, and he brought her to the man.\u201d)\n\u2028Genesis 16:2b\n(In Genesis 3:17, God says to Adam, \u201cBecause you listened to the voice of your wife\u2026\u201d)\n\u2028Genesis 16:3-4\n\u201cSarai, the wife of Abram, took Hagar the Egyptian her female slave\u2026 and she gave her to Abram her husband as a wife (Gen. 3:6, \u201cand she gave also to her husband with her\u201d). And he went into her and she became pregnant and she saw that (\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8\u05d0 \u05db\u05d9) she was pregnant, and her mistress became less in her eyes\u201d (Gen. 3:6, \u201cWhen the woman saw that [\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8\u05d0] the tree was good\u2026\u201d).\n\u2028Genesis 16:6\n(Gen. 3:6, \u201cWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes\u2026\u201d).\n\u2028Genesis 16:6b-7\n(Gen. 3:24, \u201cSo [God] drove the man out\u2026.\u201d)\nIn Genesis 22, when God provides a son from Sarah, God demands his life. God does not take lightly to the oppression of Egyptian slaves (the entire Exodus slavery is an inverted consequence for this sin). Also because of this sin, Ishmael is cast out from Abraham\u2019s family, which grieves God, so he demands that Abraham give Isaac back to him.\nGod is looking for people who will trust Yahweh\u2019s word and command over their own wisdom, that will reverse the folly and fear of Adam and Eve. The first character to demonstrate this Abraham in Genesis 22:4-6:\n\u201cAnd Abraham lifted his eyes (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5) and he saw (\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0)\u2026 and he took (\u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05d7) in his hand the fire and the knife/eater(\u05de\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05ea), and the two of them (\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd) walked on together (\u05d9\u05d7\u05d3\u05d5).\u201d\nThis releases the blessing of Eden through Abraham\u2019s fear of Yahweh out into the nations.\n\u2028Genesis 22:15-18\u2028\"Then the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, and said, \u201cBy Myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son, indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies. In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have listened My voice.\u201d\nThe point is this: When humans don\u2019t live by their own wisdom regarding good and bad, but instead trust God\u2019s wisdom and obey his commands (the fear of the Lord), it leads to blessing and life. This is true wisdom: to live in the fear of the Lord.\nIn part 3 (19:20-36:45), Tim begins to outline the story of Solomon.\nTim says Solomon is presented as a new Adam. He has an opportunity to rule the world, and he actually asks God to give him wisdom to rule. Solomon is a complex character, depicted as both a new, ideal Adam\u2014but also as a failed, foolish Adam. In one narrative thread, he is depicted as a new Adam/Abraham, meeting God in a new high-place, and living by God\u2019s wisdom/Torah.\n1 Kings 3:3-15\n\u201cThen Solomon said, \u2018You have shown great covenant love to Your servant David my father...You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. Now, O Lord my God, You have made Your servant king in place of my father David, yet I am but a little child; I do not know to go out or come in.\u2028\n\u201c\u2018Your servant is in the midst of Your people which You have chosen, a great people who are too many to be numbered or counted. So give Your servant a heart that listens in order to govern Your people, in order to discern between good (Heb. tov) and bad (Heb. ra\u2019). For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?\u2019\u201d\n\u2028\u201cIt was good (tov) in the eyes of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing. God said to him, \u2018Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself discernment to hear justice, behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given you a heart of wisdom and discernment, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you. I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days. If you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days.\u2019 Then Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream.\u201d\nTim shows how Solomon was blessed after he began to walk in the fear of the lord.\n1 Kings 4:20-21, 25, 29-34\u2028\u201cJudah and Israel were as numerous as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance; they were eating and drinking and rejoicing. Now Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; they brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life\u2026.\u201d\n\u2028\u201cSo Judah and Israel lived in safety, every man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.\u201d\n\u2028\u201cNow God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of mind, like the sand that is on the seashore. Solomon\u2019s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was known in all the surrounding nations. He also spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs were 1,005. He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he spoke also of beasts and birds and creepers and fish (do you hear Genesis 1 in there?). Men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.\"\nSolomon is portrayed as a new Adam, wisely ruling a garden with trees for everyone, fruitful and multiplying, boundaries expanded to Eden-like proportions. He knows the plants, beasts, birds, and creepers. He is more wise than \u201call the sons of the East\u201d (link to the book of Job). He spoke thousands of proverbs (link to the book of Proverbs). He wrote over a thousand songs (link to Song of Songs).\u2028\nIn part 4 (36:45-52:50), Tim outlines the foolish side of Solomon\u2019s life. Solomon enslaved people to help him build Jerusalem up. He imported and exported arms, chariots and horses to other countries. He had hundreds of wives and concubines. Solomon demonstrates wisdom but isn\u2019t fully committed to following the laws of Yahweh.\n1 Kings 5:13-17\u2028\u201cNow King Solomon levied forced laborers from all Israel; and the forced laborers numbered 30,000 men. He sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in relays; they were in Lebanon a month and two months at home. And Adoniram was over the forced laborers. Now Solomon had 70,000 transporters, and 80,000 hewers of stone in the mountains, besides Solomon\u2019s 3,300 chief deputies who were over the project and who ruled over the people who were doing the work. Then the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones.\u201d\n1 Kings 9:17, 19\u2028\u201cSo Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon... and all the storage cities which Solomon had, even the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen\u2026.\u201d\nSolomon, for all his wisdom, implemented policies which directly violated the laws of the king as outlined in the Torah.\nDeuteronomy 17:15-20\u2028\u201cyou shall surely set a king over you whom Yahweh your God chooses, one from among your countrymen you shall set as king over yourselves; you may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your countryman. Moreover, he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, since Yahweh has said to you, \u2018You shall never again return that way.\u2019 He shall not multiply wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away; nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself.\n\u2028\u201cNow it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this Torah on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. It shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God, by carefully observing all the words of this law and these statutes, that his heart may not be lifted up above his brothers and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or the left, so that he and his sons may continue long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel.\nTim has found scholar Daniel Hays to be helpful here:\n\u201cWe as readers are given a tour of a fantastic, spectacular and opulent mansion, the house of Solomon. Everywhere we look we see wealth and abundance. However, without changing the inflection of his voice the tour guide also points out places where the fa\u00e7ade has cracked, revealing a very different structure. Continuing with the standard speech which glorifies the building, the guide nonetheless makes frequent side comments (forced labor, store cities, horses from Egypt, foreign marriages) that make clear that his glowing praise for the structure is not really his honest opinion of the facility, and he wants us also to see the truth.

Solomon demonstrates wisdom but isn\u2019t fully committed to following the laws of Yahweh.\n1 Kings 5:13-17\u2028\u201cNow King Solomon levied forced laborers from all Israel; and the forced laborers numbered 30,000 men. He sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in relays; they were in Lebanon a month and two months at home. And Adoniram was over the forced laborers. Now Solomon had 70,000 transporters, and 80,000 hewers of stone in the mountains, besides Solomon\u2019s 3,300 chief deputies who were over the project and who ruled over the people who were doing the work. Then the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones.\u201d\n1 Kings 9:17, 19\u2028\u201cSo Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon... and all the storage cities which Solomon had, even the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen\u2026.\u201d\nSolomon, for all his wisdom, implemented policies which directly violated the laws of the king as outlined in the Torah.\nDeuteronomy 17:15-20\u2028\u201cyou shall surely set a king over you whom Yahweh your God chooses, one from among your countrymen you shall set as king over yourselves; you may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your countryman. Moreover, he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, since Yahweh has said to you, \u2018You shall never again return that way.\u2019 He shall not multiply wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away; nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself.\n\u2028\u201cNow it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this Torah on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. It shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God, by carefully observing all the words of this law and these statutes, that his heart may not be lifted up above his brothers and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or the left, so that he and his sons may continue long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel.\nTim has found scholar Daniel Hays to be helpful here:\n\u201cWe as readers are given a tour of a fantastic, spectacular and opulent mansion, the house of Solomon. Everywhere we look we see wealth and abundance. However, without changing the inflection of his voice the tour guide also points out places where the fa\u00e7ade has cracked, revealing a very different structure. Continuing with the standard speech which glorifies the building, the guide nonetheless makes frequent side comments (forced labor, store cities, horses from Egypt, foreign marriages) that make clear that his glowing praise for the structure is not really his honest opinion of the facility, and he wants us also to see the truth. Finally, at the end of the tour in chapters 11, he can restrain himself no more, and he tells us plainly that the building is basically a fraud, covered with a thin veneer of glitz and hoopla, and soon will collapse under its own weight. This is the manner in which the narrator of 1 Kings leads us on a tour of the House of Solomon.\u201d (Daniel Hays, \u201cNarrative Subtlety in 1 Kings 1-11: Does the narrative praise or bury Solomon?\u201d)\nTim points out that Solomon violates every rule that Israel\u2019s king was supposed to follow. A Bible reader should ask why the narrator is giving us a dual portrait of Solomon?\nIn the New Testament, Jesus says, \u201csomething greater than Solomon is here.\u201d (Matthew 12:42; Luke 11:31). Jesus positioned himself as the true example of the ideal human who learns wisdom correctly by learning from Yahweh God.\nIn part 5 (52:50-end), the guys discuss the seeming asymmetry of male and female portrayals in the Bible. Why is it that a woman is portrayed as a \u201cwise and foolish woman\u201d in Proverbs? Why are women often portrayed with seductive and illicit behavior?\nTim points out that throughout history, men have been the ones translating the Bible, so they have default and built-in blind spots to understanding and accurately portraying a better view of man and woman\u2019s portrayal in the original Hebrew context.\n\u2028Tim notes that women have been making great strides in contributing to and furthering academic and scholastic work on biblical texts and that their voices need to be heard.\nThank you to all our supporters!\nShow Resources:\u00a0\nShow Music:\nShow Produced by:\u00a0\nPowered and distributed by Simplecast",

            "content": "<p>In part 1 (0-19:15), Tim and Jon quickly review the last episode. Tim says the entire scriptural<br />\ncanon is to be viewed as \u201cwisdom literature,\u201d but the books that specifically pertain to Solomon,<br />\nProverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, and Job are considered to be the classic wisdom<br />\nbooks.<br />\nThen they dive into examining the trees in the garden of Eden. Specifically the \u201cTree of the<br />\nKnowledge of Good and Evil.\u201d Tim notes that the Hebrew word ra<code> doesn\u2019t necessarily imply \u201cevil;\u201d it only means \u201cbad.\u201d Tim shares some other examples of the Hebrew word ra</code> in the Bible.<br />\nGood/Bad condition or quality:<br />\nJeremiah 24:1-2<br />\nthe Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the Lord. One basket<br />\nhad very tov figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very ra\u2019 figs, so ra\u2019 they could<br />\nnot be eaten.<br />\nProverbs 25:19<br />\na ra\u2019 tooth and an unsteady foot, is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble.<br />\nPleasant/unpleasant, beneficial/harmful:<br />\n1 Kings 5:4<br />\nBut now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no enemy or ra\u2019.<br />\nJudges 16:25<br />\nIt so happened when they were tov of heart, that they said, \u201cCall for Samson, that he may<br />\namuse us.\u201d So they called for Samson from the prison, and he entertained them. And they made<br />\nhim stand between the pillars.<br />\nEcclesiastes: 2:16-17<br />\nFor the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered; the days have already come when both<br />\nhave been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die! So I hated life, because the work that<br />\nis done under the sun was ra\u2019 to me.<br />\nTim\u2019s point is that to use the English word \u201cevil\u201d loads in too many ideas about moral issues<br />\nbetween good and evil. Because of this, a more accurate translation would be \u201cthe tree of the<br />\nknowledge of good and bad.\u201d<br />\nIn part 2 (19:15-30:00), Tim notes that Adam and Eve are depicted as being in their moral<br />\ninfancy in the garden. They don\u2019t know what is right and wrong. They need God to teach them<br />\nhow to be wise and how to choose what is right from wrong. Here are some other passages that<br />\nuse the Hebrew phrase \u201ctov and ra\u2019\u201d or \u201cgood and bad\u201d to illustrate this moral infancy in the<br />\nBible.<br />\n\u201cKnowing tov and ra\u2019\u201d is a sign of maturity. The phrase appears elsewhere to describe children:<br />\nDeuteronomy 1:39<br />\n\u201c...your little ones... and your sons, who today do not know good or evil, shall enter there, and I<br />\nwill give it to them and they shall possess it.<br />\n1 Kings 3:7-9<br />\n\u201cNow, O Lord my God, You have made Your servant king in place of my father David, yet I am</p>\n<p>but a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in. So give Your servant a heart that<br />\nlistens, to judge Your people, to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this<br />\ngreat people of Yours?\u201d<br />\nIsaiah 7:15-16<br />\n\u201c[Immanuel] will eat curds and honey at the time He knows to refuse evil and choose good. For<br />\nbefore the boy will know to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread<br />\nwill be forsaken.<br />\nThe narrative in Genesis 1-2 has shown that God knows what is \u201cpleasant/beneficial,\u201d and he<br />\nwill provide tov (the woman) when something is not tov (man being alone), that is, ra\u2019. So the<br />\ntree represents a choice: Will they live with God, allowing him to know/define tov and ra\u2019?<br />\nPresumably they need this knowledge as they mature, but the question is who will teach it to<br />\nthem? Will they learn from watching God\u2019s knowledge at work?<br />\nAdam and Eve are portrayed as \u201cchildren.\u201d The tree of knowing tov and ra\u2019 represents two<br />\noptions or modes for how to know and experience tov and ra\u2019: Will they \u201ctake\u201d this knowledge for<br />\nthemselves, so that they \u201cbecome like elohim,\u201d knowing what is tov and ra\u2019? Or instead, will they<br />\nallow God to teach them wisdom? The gift of God to the man and woman became the means of<br />\nthe downfall. Instead of waiting for God to teach them \u201cknowing good and bad,\u201d they chose to<br />\ntake it for themselves, in their own time and way.<br />\nGenesis 3:6<br />\nWhen the woman saw that the tree [of knowing good and bad] was good for food, and that it<br />\nwas a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise (Heb. \u015bekel), she<br />\ntook from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.<br />\n\u201cWisdom\u201d = \u015bekel (\u05dc\u05d4\u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05dc:(<br />\n\u201c\u015bekel refers to a kind of wisdom. Its core meaning is \u201cinsight,\u201d the ability to grasp the meanings<br />\nor implications of a situation or message. \u015aekel is consequently discernment or prudence, the<br />\nability to understand practical matters and interpersonal relations and make beneficial decisions.<br />\nIt later comes to include intellectual understanding and unusual expertise.\u201d (Michael V. Fox,<br />\nProverbs 1\u20139: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, vol. 18A, Anchor Yale<br />\nBible [New Haven; London: Yale University Press, 2008], 36.)<br />\nIn part 3 (30:00-39:45), Tim and Jon discuss the fallout of Adam and Eve\u2019s decision to eat from<br />\nthe tree of the knowledge of good and bad. When God holds \u201ctrial\u201d with Adam and Eve, their<br />\nresponse is to \u201cfear\u201d Yahweh, but in a way that drive them away from him.<br />\nGenesis 3:8-10<br />\nThey heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man<br />\nand his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.<br />\nThen the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d He said, \u201cI heard the<br />\nsound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.\u201d<br />\nThen they blame each other: man and woman, united in their rebellion and divided by the<br />\nfallout.<br />\nGenesis 3:16<br />\n\u201cYet your desire will be for your husband,<br />\nAnd he will rule over you.\u201d<br />\nThis is the opposite of the ideal vision in Genesis 1:26-28 where man and woman rule together.<br />\nThe two are no longer one, but rather two, trying to gain leverage over one another.<br />\nIn part 4 (39:45-end), the guys discuss how God acts mercifully after Adam and Eve eat of the<br />\ntree. Tim then starts to look forward to the stories of Solomon and how it hyperlinks back to the story of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nMichael V.

The sages of Israel were concerned with the present, how to cope with the challenges provoked by one\u2019s immediate experience\u2026 The choice between life and death which Moses dramatically places before Israel in Deuteronomy 30:15-30 is re-echoed in the sages emphasis on wisdom that leads to life. The life-death situation is expressed in the image of the \u201ctree of life.\u201d Proverbs 3:18: \u201cWisdom is a tree of life to those who grasp her; how fortunate are those who embrace her.\u201d This image is well-known from its appearance in Genesis: the first dwellers in the garden were kept from that tree lest they live forever (Genesis 2:9, 3:22-24). In a vivid turn of metaphor, wisdom in Proverbs has become the tree of life and is personified as a woman: \u201cLong life is in her right hand, in her left, wealth and honor. She boasts that the one who finds find life (Prov 8:35) and the one who fails is ultimately in love with death (Prov 8:36)... One must hear wisdom obediently, but one must also pray for the gift that she is\u2026. Embracing the gift of wisdom is precarious, however, because, according to the sages, we are easily deceived: \u201cThere is more hope for a fool, than for those who are wise in their own eyes\u201d (Prov 26:12)\u201d -- Roland Murphy, The Tree of Life: An Exploration of Biblical Wisdom Literature, pp. Ix-x.</p>\n<p>In part three (31:50-40:20), Tim dives into Genesis 1-3 and discusses the human quest for wisdom.</p>\n<p>Tim notes that you can trace the thread of God discerning what is \u201cgood and bad\u201d in the creation narrative:</p>\n<p>God is the provider with all knowledge of \u201cgood and bad\u201d (tov and ra in Hebrew). God the creator provides all that is \u201cgood\u201d (Heb. tov). Seven times in Genesis 1 &quot;God saw that it was tov.\u201d God is the first one to identify something as \u201cnot good:\u201d a lonely human in the garden. God sees the problem and asks how humanity can \u201cbe fruitful and multiply and fill the land and rule the creatures\u201d alone, and sees the need for human companionship.</p>\n<p>In part four (40:20-end), the guys continue the conversation. What does God do? He &quot;splits the adam&quot; and creates man and woman.</p>\n<p>Genesis 2:21-25:<br />\n&quot;So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the human, and he slept; then He took one of his sides and closed the flesh at that place. And the Yahweh God built the side which He had taken from the human into a woman, and brought her to the man. The human said,<br />\n'This is now bone of my bones,<br />\nAnd flesh of my flesh;<br />\nShe shall be called Woman [issah]<br />\nBecause she was taken out of [ish].'<br />\nFor this reason, a ish shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his isshah; and they shall become one flesh. And the two of them were naked, the adam and his wife and were not ashamed.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim notes that God provides humans with what they cannot give themselves: blessing, fruitfulness, and dominion over the land (Gen 1:26-28). God divides the human in half (the word means &quot;side&quot; in Hebrew) and makes two humans who are unique and yet designed to become one. This relationship of man and woman becoming one, with no shame, no powerplays, no oppression, to know and be known in pure naked vulnerability before God and before one another, nothing hidden, everything revealed and loved, this is Eden.

I have a question concerning biblical law and God's nature. I've talked to some friends on this issue for some time, and their view is that God's nature was not fully revealed in the Old Testament. So God's will was not fully revealed. They believe this is why the Israelites thought they had to live under the law. They use Paul's writings to back that up. They also believe that the New Testament is the full revelation of God and his nature. And so we can see his full intent was to have a personal relationship instead of a list of rules to follow. What would you say to this worldview and why it should be changed?</p>\n<p>Rich from New York (13:10):<br />\nI'm a pastor in upstate New York. Your series on the law is just outstanding. And yet I have a question. As you folks talked about the common law understanding of law that existed until the last few centuries, I found myself wondering about the understanding of law among the Pharisees of the first century, for example. It seems that their understanding wasn't just that the mosaic law was a snapshot in time but that it described how the law needed to be lived out in any age, whatever possible, more like statutory law. Or am I wrong about that?</p>\n<p>Victoria from Tennessee (21:45):<br />\nHey Tim and Jon, this is Victoria in Chattanooga, Tennessee. I've been really inspired by this conversation about the law, particularly the relationships of the New Testament to the Old Testament. I'm sure you're getting here, but I wanted to ask how we\u2019re asked to understand our broad call to obedience when Jesus says something like in Matthew 5, \u201ctherefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d What commands is he referring to, and is the spirit of the law or commands a filter for interpretation, or is there a place where we need to draw a line in the sand? Thanks.</p>\n<p>Joe from Cleveland (22:15):<br />\nWhat I\u2019m still at tension with are Jesus\u2019 words in Matthew 5:18-19 where he states not a dot or iota will pass away from the law, and those who relax the least of these will be least in heaven. It seems we had agreed the Hebrew Torah showed itself to be flexible and not necessarily the final word in judicial cases. I interpret Jesus \u201cdot and iota\u201d statement as a more literal or explicit command to the letter of the law so to speak. Does Jesus\u2019 statement raise that tension for you or is there another way of understanding it?</p>\n<p>Petra from the Netherlands (39:30):</p>\n<p>Hi Tim and Jon my name is Petra, I'm from the Netherlands.

            "content": "<p>In part one (0:00-25:30), the guys discuss the series so far, and Tim dives into the final two perspectives to keep in mind when reading biblical law. The fifth perspective is that the purpose of the covenant laws is fulfilled in Jesus and the Spirit.</p>\n<p>The dual role of the laws\u2013\u2013to condemn and to point the way to true life\u2013\u2013is fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and in the coming of the Spirit to Jesus\u2019 new covenant people. Jesus was the first obedient human and the faithful Israelite who fulfilled the law yet bore the curse of humanity's punishment so that others could have life and the status of covenant righteousness. Tim references Matthew 5:17-20:</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim notes that Jesus is the embodiment of the point of the law, the ideal person who doesn\u2019t need the law because they are abiding with Yahweh by nature.</p>\n<p>In part two (25:30-35:00), Tim asks who or what is being punished on the cross. Tim references Romans 8:3:</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim notes that Paul doesn\u2019t mean that God hated humanity and punished Jesus instead of punishing humanity. Instead, God loved humanity in its weakness and failure and punished sin and condemned sin through Jesus dying on the cross.</p>\n<p>Tim notes that Paul thinks of sin as a cosmic tyrant. It's not just an individual problem, but a problem of essential mode existence for the world. The law, or divine command, was supposed to be an opportunity for humans to realize their true calling of acting in God\u2019s image voluntarily. Instead, we chose and choose to disobey and now live \u201censlaved\u201d to our decision(s).</p>\n<p>In part three (35:00-end), Tim discusses the last perspective: The laws are a source of wisdom for all generations.</p>\n<p>The Torah is viewed as a source of wisdom within the Hebrew Bible</p>\n<p>The tree of knowing good and evil is the pathway to the tree of life. In Proverbs, learning wisdom is the pathway to the tree of life. Tim uses the following proverbs to illustrate his point.<br />\nProverbs 1:7:<br />\n&quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowing;<br />\nFools despise wisdom and instruction.&quot;</p>\n<p>Proverbs 3:13, 18:<br />\n&quot;How blessed is the man who finds wisdom<br />\nAnd the man who gains understanding.<br />\nShe is a tree of life to those who take hold of her,<br />\nAnd happy are all who hold her fast.&quot;</p>\n<p>Proverbs 15:3-4:<br />\n&quot;The eyes of the Lord are in every place,<br />\nWatching the evil and the good.<br />\nA soothing tongue is a tree of life,<br />\nBut perversion in it crushes the spirit.<br />\nTim notes that Wisdom is the way to fulfill the Shema.&quot;</p>\n<p>Proverbs 6:20-23:<br />\n&quot;My son, keep the commandment of your father<br />\nAnd do not forsake the instruction of your mother;<br />\nBind them continually on your heart;<br />\nTie them around your neck.<br />\nWhen you walk about, they will guide you;<br />\nWhen you sleep, they will watch over you;<br />\nAnd when you awake, they will talk to you.&quot;</p>\n<p>Time compares the preceding passage with Deuteronomy 6:4-8:<br />\n\u201cHear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!<br />\nYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.<br />\nThese words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart.<br />\nYou shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.<br />\nYou shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.<br />\nYou shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim notes that these two passages mirror each other, as they teach that acting wisely fulfills the law.</p>\n<p>Tim then discusses the apostle Paul to show how he continued to use the laws as wisdom literature.<br />\n1 Corinthians 9:9-12:<br />\n&quot;For it is written in the Law of Moses, 'You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing.' God is not concerned about oxen, is He? Or is He speaking altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops. If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap material things from you? If others share the right over you, do we not more? Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim quotes Richard B. Hays to understand Paul's continuation of Jewish law.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is often cited as an example of arbitrary prooftexting on Paul\u2019s part, but closer observation demonstrates a more complex hermeneutical strategy at play here. First of all, Paul is operating with an explicitly stated hermeneutical principle that God is really concerned about human beings, not oxen, and that the text should be read accordingly (vv. 9\u201310). Second, a careful look at the context of Deuteronomy 25:4 lends some credence to Paul\u2019s claim about this particular text. The surrounding laws in Deuteronomy 24 and 25 (especially Deut. 24:6\u20137, 10\u201322; 25:1\u20133) almost all serve to promote dignity and justice for human beings; the one verse about the threshing ox sits oddly in this context. It is not surprising that Paul would have read this verse also as suggesting something about justice in human economic affairs.\u201d -- Richard B.

Tim then dives into a third perspective on the Hebrew laws in the Old Testament.</p>\n<p>The third perspective is that the laws embody and revolutionize ancient Eastern conceptions of justice. The laws are formulated in the language and categories of ancient Near Eastern law, so that Israel\u2019s law was comprehensible to their neighbors while also representing an irreversible cultural revolution.</p>\n<p>Tim notes that in all the other ancient covenant documents (Hittite, Assyrian) only one is between a king and a people, while dozens of others are between one king and another king. Covenants are agreements between kings. But the Biblical story depicts the laws as stipulations between God and all the Israelites: \u201cI will be their God and they will be my people.\u201d This is the same kind of language we find in the Song of Solomon, \u201cI am my beloved\u2019s and he is mine\u201d (Song of Solomon 6:3). This is marriage covenant language.</p>\n<p>Tim uses some quotes from Joshua Berman to make his points.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the ancient near east, various gods had consorts and goddess wives, while the common man was subject, a slave and servant of the king and the tribute-imposing class. For these cultures to conceive of the marriage between a god and a group of humans, would have been as unthinkable as for us to imagine the marital union of a human and a cat\u2026 The Bible\u2019s most revolutionary idea\u2026 is the idea of God as a personality who seeks a relationship of mutuality with human agents. In the neighboring cultures of the ancient Near East, humans were merely slaves of the king. In the Bible, they are transformed into a servant king who is married to a generous sovereign, a wife in relation to her benefactor husband. When God seeks \u201clove\u201d from Israel, it involves both the political sense of loyalty between parties to a treaty as well as the kind of intimacy known in a faithful, intimate relationship between a man and woman.\u201d (Berman, Created Equal, 46)</p>\n<p>This concept of a human family married to God is founded on the concept of humanity in Genesis 1-2. All humanity, male and female, is the divine royal image over all creation. And while the Davidic king could be called the \u201cson of God,\u201d it was only as the representative of all Israel who is the \u201cson of God\u201d (Exodus 4:22). The king and all the Israelites are themselves equals under their \u201cdivine king\u201d Yahweh. Tim again cites Joshua Berman:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the bridge figure between the divine and human was the king, deified (as in Egypt) or more of a demi-god (Mesopotamia). He was the top of the socio-religious structure with the economic elite, and this was mirrored by the hierarchy of the gods. NOT SO in biblical Israel. God\u2019s covenant was with the entirety of Israel, focused on the \u201ccommon man.\u201d I maintain that it is in the covenant, properly conceived in in ancient Near Eastern setting, that we may discern a radically new understanding of the cosmic role of the common man within the thought systems of the ancient Near East, one that constituted the basis of an egalitarian order.\u201d (Berman, Created Equal, 29)</p>\n<p>In part 2 (17:00-25:15), Tim explains why Israel\u2019s law codes consistently downgrades the role of the king in contrast to their neighbors. The king is not the sole, chief, divine authority; rather, Yahweh is king, and the human king is subservient to the Scriptures (Deuteronomy 17) and to prophets who speak on Yahweh\u2019s behalf. He is a leader in war, but he is not the chief. He can participate in the temple, but he is not the high priest. He is subservient to the law, but he is not the lawgiver. This is all in contrast to Egypt and Babylon.</p>\n<p>Tim also explains that the laws allowed Israel\u2019s economy to be oriented toward landed families, which were called to include the immigrant, poor, and orphans. It is the first ancient example of \u201cwelfare society.\u201d You can see examples of laws about not maximizing profit to allow work in the fields in Ruth chapters 2-3.</p>\n<p>Other examples include laws about the seven year debt release, Jubilee land and debt release, not charging interest on loans for the poor, giving a tithe for local loans for failing farmers.</p>\n<p>Tim again cites Berman:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe biblical laws about land and assets introduce a reformation of the ancient worldview aimed at achieving a social equality, but of a very specific king. It is not the egalitarianism developed since the French Revolution with its emphasis on the individual and inalienable human rights\u2026 Rather, it takes the form of an economic system that seeks equality by granting sacred value to the extended family household, where people assist one another in farming labor and in granting relief to other households in need. Ancient Israel was a tribal association of free farmers and ranchers, living in a single and equal social class with common ownership of the means of production. This system was a rejection of statism (= the nations state owns all land) and feudalism (= military lords own all land), demonstrated by the fact that it was free of tribute to any human king, and their tribute was a shared burden of funding the temple. Israel defined itself in opposition to the empire of oppression embodied by Egyptian slavery, and also in opposition to the centralized monarchies that surrounded and took up residence in Israel.\u201d (Berman, Created Equal, 87)</p>\n<p>Tim points out that a scholar named David Bentley Hart has influenced his thinking on this subject. Tim says that the Judeo-Christian heritage is the most beautiful thing about Western civilization.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (25:15-30:00), Tim teaches through a specific law that is usually very disturbing to modern readers.</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 21:10-14<br />\n10 When you go to war against your enemies and the Lord your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives, 11 if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife. 12 Bring her into your home and have her shave her head, trim her nails 13 and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife. 14 If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.</p>\n<p>Tim points out that this law does not promote the practice it seems to promote. Instead, it creates boundaries for a common cultural practice, which are eventually designed to obliterate the practice all together. This law is in reaction to other ancient cultures that didn\u2019t have any rules or give any thought to how soldiers should treat their captives.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (30:00-43:10), Tim brings up an important point to keep in mind when reading biblical law: The laws play an important but ultimately subordinate role in the plot of the larger biblical storyline that leads to Jesus. Humanity\u2019s failure to obey the divine command is part of the plot conflict that prevents them from being God\u2019s image-partners in ruling creation. The laws illustrate the divine ideal while also intensifying that conflict, creating the need for a new human and a new covenant.</p>\n<p>Tim notes that the first divine command is in the garden of Eden:</p>\n<p>Genesis 2:16-17<br />\n16 The Lord God commanded the man, saying, \u201cFrom any tree of the garden you may eat freely; 17 but from the tree of knowing good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says the failure to \u201clisten to the voice of God\u201d (breaking the divine command) results in exile from the Eden-mountain, leading to death.</p>\n<p>Genesis 3:17, 24<br />\n17 Then to Adam He said, \u201cBecause you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, \u2018You shall not eat from it\u2019;<br />\n24 So He banished the human; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.</p>\n<p>In part 5, (43:10-end) Tim notes that this theme of listening or not listening to the divine command continues through the Bible.</p>\n<p>Exodus 19:4-6<br />\n4 \u2018You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles\u2019 wings, and brought you to Myself. 5 \u2018Now then, if you will listen listen to My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine; 6 and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\u2019 These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim notes that the story immediately after this story is the story of the golden calf, which shows Israel\u2019s obvious failure to listen.</p>\n<p>Tim points out that Israel\u2019s covenant choice is the same as Adam and Eve and all humanity.</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 30:15-20<br />\n15 \u201cSee, I have set before you today life and good, and death and evil; 16 in that I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, that you may have life and multiply, and that the Lord your God may bless you in the land where you are entering to possess it. 17 \u201cBut if your heart turns away and you will not obey, but are drawn away and worship other gods and serve them, 18 I declare to you today that you shall surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess it. 19 \u201cI call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. So choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, 20 by loving the Lord your God, by listening to His voice, and by holding fast to Him; for this is your life and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim notes that Israel\u2019s inability to \u201clisten to the voice\u201d of God, leading to death and exile, traps humanity in the power of death, which necessitates the messianic age and the new covenant.</p>\n<p>Jeremiah 31:31-34<br />\n31 \u201cBehold, days are coming,\u201d declares the Lord, \u201cwhen I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, 32 not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them,\u201d declares the Lord. 33 \u201cBut this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,\u201d declares the Lord, \u201cI will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. 34 \u201cThey will not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, \u2018Know the Lord,\u2019 for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,\u201d declares the Lord, \u201cfor I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ezekiel 36:26-28<br />\n26 \u201cMoreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 \u201cI will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances. 28 \u201cYou will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers; so you will be My people, and I will be your God.</p>\n<p>Tim concludes by sharing that the law isn't about an &quot;Old Covenant or New Covenant&quot; question. Instead, the law illuminates and explores the portrait of humanity repeatedly failing to listen to the divine voice.</p>\n<p>Show Produced by:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins.</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\n\u201cDefender Instrumental\u201d by Tents<br />\n\u201cCartilage\u201d by Moby<br />\n\u201cAll Night\u201d by Unwritten Stories<br />\n\u201cGood Morning\u201d by Unwritten Stories<br />\nThe Pilgrim\u2028</p>\n<p>Show Resources:</p>\n<p>Our video on the law: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sew1kBIe-W0</p>\n<p>Joshua Berman: Created Equal: How the Bible Broke with Ancient Political Thought\u2028</p>\n",

This is marriage covenant language.\nTim uses some quotes from Joshua Berman to make his points.\n\u201cIn the ancient near east, various gods had consorts and goddess wives, while the common man was subject, a slave and servant of the king and the tribute-imposing class. For these cultures to conceive of the marriage between a god and a group of humans, would have been as unthinkable as for us to imagine the marital union of a human and a cat\u2026 The Bible\u2019s most revolutionary idea\u2026 is the idea of God as a personality who seeks a relationship of mutuality with human agents. In the neighboring cultures of the ancient Near East, humans were merely slaves of the king. In the Bible, they are transformed into a servant king who is married to a generous sovereign, a wife in relation to her benefactor husband. When God seeks \u201clove\u201d from Israel, it involves both the political sense of loyalty between parties to a treaty as well as the kind of intimacy known in a faithful, intimate relationship between a man and woman.\u201d (Berman, Created Equal, 46)\nThis concept of a human family married to God is founded on the concept of humanity in Genesis 1-2. All humanity, male and female, is the divine royal image over all creation. And while the Davidic king could be called the \u201cson of God,\u201d it was only as the representative of all Israel who is the \u201cson of God\u201d (Exodus 4:22). The king and all the Israelites are themselves equals under their \u201cdivine king\u201d Yahweh. Tim again cites Joshua Berman:\n\u201cWhile in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the bridge figure between the divine and human was the king, deified (as in Egypt) or more of a demi-god (Mesopotamia). He was the top of the socio-religious structure with the economic elite, and this was mirrored by the hierarchy of the gods. NOT SO in biblical Israel. God\u2019s covenant was with the entirety of Israel, focused on the \u201ccommon man.\u201d I maintain that it is in the covenant, properly conceived in in ancient Near Eastern setting, that we may discern a radically new understanding of the cosmic role of the common man within the thought systems of the ancient Near East, one that constituted the basis of an egalitarian order.\u201d (Berman, Created Equal, 29)\nIn part 2 (17:00-25:15), Tim explains why Israel\u2019s law codes consistently downgrades the role of the king in contrast to their neighbors. The king is not the sole, chief, divine authority; rather, Yahweh is king, and the human king is subservient to the Scriptures (Deuteronomy 17) and to prophets who speak on Yahweh\u2019s behalf. He is a leader in war, but he is not the chief. He can participate in the temple, but he is not the high priest. He is subservient to the law, but he is not the lawgiver. This is all in contrast to Egypt and Babylon.\nTim also explains that the laws allowed Israel\u2019s economy to be oriented toward landed families, which were called to include the immigrant, poor, and orphans. It is the first ancient example of \u201cwelfare society.\u201d You can see examples of laws about not maximizing profit to allow work in the fields in Ruth chapters 2-3.\nOther examples include laws about the seven year debt release, Jubilee land and debt release, not charging interest on loans for the poor, giving a tithe for local loans for failing farmers.\nTim again cites Berman:\n\u201cThe biblical laws about land and assets introduce a reformation of the ancient worldview aimed at achieving a social equality, but of a very specific king. It is not the egalitarianism developed since the French Revolution with its emphasis on the individual and inalienable human rights\u2026 Rather, it takes the form of an economic system that seeks equality by granting sacred value to the extended family household, where people assist one another in farming labor and in granting relief to other households in need. Ancient Israel was a tribal association of free farmers and ranchers, living in a single and equal social class with common ownership of the means of production. This system was a rejection of statism (= the nations state owns all land) and feudalism (= military lords own all land), demonstrated by the fact that it was free of tribute to any human king, and their tribute was a shared burden of funding the temple. Israel defined itself in opposition to the empire of oppression embodied by Egyptian slavery, and also in opposition to the centralized monarchies that surrounded and took up residence in Israel.\u201d (Berman, Created Equal, 87)\nTim points out that a scholar named David Bentley Hart has influenced his thinking on this subject. Tim says that the Judeo-Christian heritage is the most beautiful thing about Western civilization.\nIn part 3 (25:15-30:00), Tim teaches through a specific law that is usually very disturbing to modern readers.\nDeuteronomy 21:10-14\nTim points out that this law does not promote the practice it seems to promote. Instead, it creates boundaries for a common cultural practice, which are eventually designed to obliterate the practice all together. This law is in reaction to other ancient cultures that didn\u2019t have any rules or give any thought to how soldiers should treat their captives.\nIn part 4 (30:00-43:10), Tim brings up an important point to keep in mind when reading biblical law: The laws play an important but ultimately subordinate role in the plot of the larger biblical storyline that leads to Jesus. Humanity\u2019s failure to obey the divine command is part of the plot conflict that prevents them from being God\u2019s image-partners in ruling creation. The laws illustrate the divine ideal while also intensifying that conflict, creating the need for a new human and a new covenant.\nTim notes that the first divine command is in the garden of Eden:\nGenesis 2:16-17\nTim says the failure to \u201clisten to the voice of God\u201d (breaking the divine command) results in exile from the Eden-mountain, leading to death.\nGenesis 3:17, 24\nIn part 5, (43:10-end) Tim notes that this theme of listening or not listening to the divine command continues through the Bible.\nExodus 19:4-6\nTim notes that the story immediately after this story is the story of the golden calf, which shows Israel\u2019s obvious failure to listen.\nTim points out that Israel\u2019s covenant choice is the same as Adam and Eve and all humanity.\nDeuteronomy 30:15-20\nTim notes that Israel\u2019s inability to \u201clisten to the voice\u201d of God, leading to death and exile, traps humanity in the power of death, which necessitates the messianic age and the new covenant.\nJeremiah 31:31-34\nEzekiel 36:26-28\nTim concludes by sharing that the law isn't about an \"Old Covenant or New Covenant\" question. Instead, the law illuminates and explores the portrait of humanity repeatedly failing to listen to the divine voice.\nShow Produced by:\nShow Music:\n\u201cDefender Instrumental\u201d by Tents\n\u201cCartilage\u201d by Moby\n\u201cAll Night\u201d by Unwritten Stories\n\u201cGood Morning\u201d by Unwritten Stories\nThe Pilgrim\u2028\nShow Resources:\nOur video on the law: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sew1kBIe-W0\nJoshua Berman: Created Equal: How the Bible Broke with Ancient Political Thought",
            "contentSnippet": "In part 1 (0-17:00), The guys quickly recap their conversation so far. Tim then dives into a third perspective on the Hebrew laws in the Old Testament.\nThe third perspective is that the laws embody and revolutionize ancient Eastern conceptions of justice. The laws are formulated in the language and categories of ancient Near Eastern law, so that Israel\u2019s law was comprehensible to their neighbors while also representing an irreversible cultural revolution.\nTim notes that in all the other ancient covenant documents (Hittite, Assyrian) only one is between a king and a people, while dozens of others are between one king and another king. Covenants are agreements between kings. But the Biblical story depicts the laws as stipulations between God and all the Israelites: \u201cI will be their God and they will be my people.\u201d This is the same kind of language we find in the Song of Solomon, \u201cI am my beloved\u2019s and he is mine\u201d (Song of Solomon 6:3).

            "content": "<p>In part 1 (0-21:30), the guys recap their conversation so far. Jon says that often the law is the first place people go who look to take issue with the Bible, saying it\u2019s archaic or barbaric. Tim points out that too often, we don\u2019t understand how cross-cultural it is to read the Bible. Instead, we often impose our own cultural mindset on the Bible.</p>\n<p>Jon recalls from their discussion that the ancient law code of Israel was not the supreme authority, but instead illustrative of the relationships between the parties involved.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (21:30-26:30), Tim talks about the wisdom of the laws in the Hebrew Scriptures. Tim shares this quote:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Hebrew Bible strongly suggests that the earliest forms of disputes\u2026 were resolved\u2026 by intuitions of justice against a background of custom, rather than appeal to formulated rules. The biblical sources which talk about the establishment of the judicial system in Israel give no indication that judges were to use written sources. Rather, judges are urged to avoid partiality and corruption and to \u2018do justice.\u2019 But what was the source of such justice? The version attributed to king Jehoshaphat is the most explicit, \u2018God is with you in giving judgment\u2019 (2 Chronicles 19:6). Divine inspiration is also attributed to the king in rendering judgment: Proverbs 16:10, \u2018Inspired decisions are on the lips of a king; his mouth does not sin in judgment.\u2019 Solomon\u2019s judgment (1 Kings 3:16-28) is presented as an example of just such a process\u2026. This is not to say that judges were expected to go into some kind of trance or function as an oracle. Rather, they were called to operate by combining local custom with divinely guided intuitions of justice\u2026relying on the \u2018practical wisdom\u2019 that existed within the social consciousness of the people as a whole.\u201d (Bernard Jackson, Wisdom Laws, 30-31)</p>\n<p>In part 3 (26:30-40:30), Tim says the laws embody a set of ideals. Laws related to similar topics work together as a symbolic ritual system. They embody a set of ethical, social, and theological ideals for God\u2019s ancient covenant people, \u201ca kingdom of priests and a holy nation\u201d living out the Garden-of-Eden ideal in the world. He shares five ideal \u201cbuckets\u201d or categories to help readers understand different laws:</p>\n<p>Ritual Calendar: The 7-day Sabbath cycle is all about the anticipation and re-enactment of new creation (note the literary design of the days in Genesis 1: There is no end to the seventh day).<br />\nRitual sacrifices: sacrifices involved offering the life of a blameless representative who would \u201cascend\u201d to the heavenly mountain on behalf of the offerer (Leviticus 1 begins with the \u201c\u2018olah\u201d or \u201cascent\u201d offering)<br />\nRitual holiness: symbolic purity boundaries embodied the conviction that God\u2019s presence is the source of all life, and health is separate from the mortal and immoral<br />\nCivil law: creating a new-creation community structured to carry the poor and prevent injustice toward the vulnerable<br />\nCriminal law: zero tolerance for those who corrupt the holy covenant family: no blood feuds, theft, idolatry, or sexual behavior that disrupts the social web</p>\n<p>In part 4 (40:30-end), Tim goes over the sacrifices in the \u201critual sacrifices\u201d bucket. He cites a book by Michael Morales called Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord? A biblical theology of Leviticus. Tim also goes over civil and criminal laws in ancient Israel. Jon asks Tim for a few specific examples. Tim goes to these passages:</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 24:21-22<br />\n\u201c21 When you harvest the grapes in your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow. 22 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt.

The version attributed to king Jehoshaphat is the most explicit, \u2018God is with you in giving judgment\u2019 (2 Chronicles 19:6).

The 613 laws all fall within the ceremony of God\u2019s covenant with Israel in Exodus 19-24.</p>\n<p>Tim asks the question: If these laws aren\u2019t a judicial code, then what are they?</p>\n<p>The laws are the shared agreement between God and Israel that was put forth in their covenant ceremony. We witness this relationship between Israel and Yahweh, Tim shares, as outsiders. People today were not at Mt. Sinai when the covenant was ratified. Instead, the law is used as \u201ctorah\u201d for us, or \u201cinstruction,\u201d meaning they reveal more about ourselves and God and the human condition. The Torah, Tim says, is a narrative about a covenant relationship, not a law code. He points out that there would have inevitably been more rules and laws governing ancient Israel than the 613 laws included in the Bible.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (21:00-26:00), Tim expresses how the law served as \u201crelational authority\u201d between Israel and God. The laws served as a witness to Israel\u2019s difference from other kingdoms, that they were a \u201ckingdom of priests\u201d who all had a relationship with God.</p>\n<p>Ancient Law: Examples from History</p>\n<p>In part 3, (26:00-41:30) Tim explains that to best understand the ancient laws of Israel, one should also understand how other ancient laws worked. Tim brings up the Code of Hammurabi, the most well known ancient law code. Tim shares the start of the law code of Hammurabi:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen lofty Anum, king of the Anunnaki and Enlil, lord of heaven and earth, the determiner of the destinies of the land, determined for Marduk, the first-born of Enki, 6 the Enlil supreme powers over all mankind, made him great among the Igigi, called Babylon by its exalted name, He made it supreme in the world, established for him in its midst an enduring kingship, whose foundations are as firm as heaven and earth\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cat that time Anum and Enlil named me to promote the welfare of the people, me, Hammurabi, the devout, god-fearing prince, to cause justice to prevail in the land, to destroy the wicked and the evil, that the strong might not oppress the weak, to rise like the sun over humankind, and to light up the land.</p>\n<p>\u201cHammurabi, the shepherd, called by Enlil, am I; the one who makes affluence and plenty abound; the one who relaid the foundations of Sippar; who decked with green the chapels of Aya; the designer of the temple of Ebabbar, which is like a heavenly dwelling.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the god Marduk commanded me to provide just ways for the people of the land (in order to attain) appropriate behavior, I established truth and justice as the declaration of the land, I enhanced the well-being of the people.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Epilogue and Prologue to the Law Code [From Martha Tobi Roth, Harry A. Hoffner, and Piotr Michalowski, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor]</p>\n<p>Here are a few laws in the code of Hammurabi:</p>\n<p>#196: &quot;If a man destroy the eye of another man, they shall destroy his eye. If one break a man's bone, they shall break his bone. If one destroy the eye of a freeman or break the bone of a freeman he shall pay one gold mina. If one destroy the eye of a man's slave or break a bone of a man's slave he shall pay one-half his price.&quot;</p>\n<p>#250 (xliv 44\u201351) \u201cIf an ox gores to death a man while it is passing through the streets, that case has no basis for a claim.\u201d</p>\n<p>#251 (xliv 52\u201365) \u201cIf a man\u2019s ox is a known gorer, and the authorities of his city quarter notify him that it is a known gorer, but he does not blunt(?) its horns or control his ox, and that ox gores to death a member of the aw\u012blu-class, he (the owner) shall give 30 shekels of silver.\u201d</p>\n<p>Here is the epilogue of the law:</p>\n<p>\u201cMay any king who will appear in the land in the future, at any time, observe the pronouncements of justice that I inscribed upon my stela. May he not alter the judgments that I rendered and the verdicts that I gave, nor remove my engraved image. If that man has discernment, and is capable of providing just ways for his land, may he heed the pronouncements I have inscribed upon my stela.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Epilogue and Prologue to the Law Code [From Martha Tobi Roth, Harry A. Hoffner, and Piotr Michalowski, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor]</p>\n<p>Tim brings up some interesting observations, puzzles and problems that ancient laws present.</p>\n<p>This code is one of the most frequently copied texts from the ancient world, copies ranging over 1500yrs, and yet, as he quotes:</p>\n<p>\u201cOf the many thousands of Mesopotamian legal documents in our possession, not one of them cites the Code of Hammurabi, or any other \u2018code\u2019 as a source of authority. This in spite of the fact that the code of Hammurabi was esteemed and recopied for more than a millennium. All of this suggests that ancient near eastern law codes were of a literary, educational, and monumental nature, rather than legal and juridical.\u201d (Joshua Berman, Created Equal: 84)</p>\n<p>The code of Hammurabi was copied and recopied for over a thousand years. But across the centuries, none of the dozens of monetary fines were changed (which they would have if consulted and used for legal purposes). The code is nowhere near comprehensive\u2014you won\u2019t find any laws concerning inheritances, one of the most important features of landed-agricultural life in Babylon. Copies of the Code of Hammurabi have been found in royal archives but never in the sites of local courts, and never with caches of legal documents (receipts, divorce certificates, etc.).</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are no ancient legal texts that ever cite or even refer to the Code as a source of law. In the thousands of ancient legal texts that do exist and address the same topics as the code, they are usually at odds with the sentences and fines given within it.</p>\n<p>So, if these compositions were not legal codes, (1) where could the law of the land be found? And if they were not legal codes, (2) what was their purpose?</p>\n<p>Tim shares this quote:</p>\n<p>\u201cArchaeologists have unearthed thousands of law-practice documents from the ancient near East, documents such as land transfers, financial contracts, and court rulings where law was applied to actual situations (divorces, civil disputes). There have also been discovered dozens of ancient law codes (Hammurabi, Ur-Namma, Lipit-Ishtar, Eshnunna). A curious problem emerges when these practice documents are compared with the law collections. The law as practiced in those cultures often differed from, even contradicted, the laws as stated in the collections. Penalties found in court decisions are repeatedly inconsistent with the penalties inscribed in the collections. Prices established in contracts don\u2019t match those given in the law codes. This has raised important questions about the purpose of these collections. Whatever their purposes were, they do not appear to have dictated actual legal practice. Scholars have come to see that these law codes as academic and monumental collections, but not the source of law in these societies.\u201d (Michael Lefebvre, Collections, Codes, and Torah, 1)</p>\n<p>Two Kinds of Law</p>\n<p>In part 4, (41:30-49:30) Tim explains that the ancient world would have been known as a common or customary law society, whereas our modern world is largely known as a statutory law society. He shares more quotes:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe scholarly consensus is that law in Mesopotamia was customary/common law. A judge would determine the law at the moment of adjudication by drawing on an extensive reservoir of custom, accepted norms, and principles from the legal texts with which he was educated. The law would vary from place to place, and neither the Code of Hammurabi nor any other text was \u2018the final word\u2019 on what law should be applied. Indeed, the association of \u201claw\u201d with a written collection of statutes and rules is a modern anachronistic imposition from our own culture. It is no surprise, therefore, that neither Mesopotamia, Egyptian, or Hittite culture has any word for \u2018written law,\u2019 that we find in later Greek as thesmos, or nomos.\u201d (Joshua Berman, Inconsistency in the Torah, 112-113)</p>\n<p>\u201cThe law collections, instead, are anthologies of judgments from times past, snapshots of decisions and customs rendered by judges or even by a king. The collections were a model of justice meant to educate and inspire\u2026. They were records of precedent, but not of legislation\u2026.they instilled in later generations of scribes a unified legal vision.\u201d (Ibid.)</p>\n<p>Tim says this has helped him understand three main purposes of the law:</p>\n<p>Judicial Education texts: Collections of the most common representative decisions from a culture, compiled to train the moral-instincts of leaders, not to legislate actual practice.<br />\nMonumental Propaganda: Like the Code of Hammurabi, the code praises the king\u2019s wisdom and justice and claims that his decisions are in fact divinely inspired.<br />\nEducational texts: These are compilations for training the scribal class, introducing them to a literary tradition of justice. \u2028</p>\n<p>In part 5 (49:30-63:00), Tim further delineates the differences between common law and statutory law:</p>\n<p>Statutory Law<br />\nThe law itself is contained in a codified text, whose authority combines two elements: (a) the law emanates from a sovereign (a king or legislative body, etc.), (b) the law is a finite and complete legal system, so that only what is written in the code is the law. The law code supersedes all other sources of law that precede the formulation of the code. Where the code lacks explicit legislation, judges must adjudicate with the code as their primary guide.</p>\n<p>Common Law<br />\nWith common law, the law is not found in a written code that serves as a judge\u2019s point of reference or limits what they can decide. Rather, the judges make decisions based on the mores and spirit of the community and its customs. Law develops through the distillation and continual restatement of legal doctrine through the decision of courts. Previous legal decisions are consulted but not binding, and importantly, a judge\u2019s decision does not create a binding law, because no particular formulation of the law is binding. The common law is consciously and inherently incomplete, fluid, and vague. Under common law, legal codes are not the source of law, but rather a resource for later judges to consult.</p>\n<p>Tim shares a helpful metaphor from Sir Matthew Hale (\u201cthe greatest British common-law judge of the 17th century\u201d): The common law can change and yet still be considered part of the same legal \u201csystem\u201d just as a ship can return home after a long voyage and still be considered the \u201csame\u201d ship, even though it returns with many repairs, new materials, and old materials discarded and replaced. In the same saw, law collections create a system of legal reasoning that a judge accesses to apply in new and unanticipated circumstances.</p>\n<p>A Helpful Illustration from History</p>\n<p>Common law traditions flourished for most of human history, because they require a homogeneous community where a common story and common values are assumed and perpetuated by all members of a society. 19th century German legal theorist Carl von Savigny called this the Volksgeist, \u201cthe collective spirit and conscience of a people.\u201d Where social cohesion breaks down, it becomes more difficult to anchor the law in a collective set of values, and this is what happened in 19th century Europe with the rise of immigration, urbanization, and the modern nation-state.</p>\n<p>Nineteenth-century Germany faced transition from a historically tribal state into a modern state (Otto von Bismarck and Carl Savigny continued to advocate the common law tradition of their past). One of his most famous students was Jacob Grimm (1785-1863), best known for his collaboration with his brother Wilhelm. These brothers did exhaustive research into their cultural folklore and produced comprehensive editions of Germany\u2019s moral heritage in their anthology called \u201cKinder und Hausmarchen\u201d = \u201cChildren\u2019s and Household Tales\u201d (2 volumes in 1812 and 1815), including the classic tales of Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin, Sleeping Beauty, and the Frog Prince.</p>\n<p>The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies. Between the first edition of 1812-15 and the seventh and final edition of 1857, they revised their collection many times so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200. In addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled German legends. Individually, they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship. Together in 1838, they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch), which, in their lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word Frucht, 'fruit'.</p>\n<p>Tim points out that the Grimm brothers bridged the gap between folklore and common law in German society into a society of more statutory law in Germany. In many ways, Tim says, this is how Israel came to treat the law. The stories surrounding the laws allowed Israel to illustrate what happens when the rules are or are not followed.</p>\n<p>Examples of Law Implementation in Scripture</p>\n<p>In part 6 (63:00-end), Tim points out that many times in the Bible, the actual implementation of the laws are totally different from the given or written laws. There are many cases where narratives about legal decisions either differ from the statements of practice in the biblical law codes, or the decision is offered without any recourse to a law code.</p>\n<p>For example, in 2 Samuel 14, David gives a ruling contrary to every law and principle in the biblical law codes concerning murder. David simply excuses his son Absalom (who murdered Amnon) with no appeal or defense of his actions and no mention of a law code.</p>\n<p>Another example is found in Jeremiah 26, the most detailed description of a trial in the Old Testament. Jeremiah is accused of treason for announcing the temple\u2019s destruction. His defense is that another prophet before him, Micah, announced the same message and he was never imprisoned. This is an argument from precedent, not from a law code. The arguments advanced against him are offered on theological grounds (\u201che speaks in the name of Yahweh\u201d) and political grounds (\u201che prophesied against our city\u201d). No law codes are ever consulted to defend or accuse him.</p>\n<p>A third example is Solomon\u2019s famous \u201cdecision\u201d about the two women in 1 Kings 3. Solomon listens to the witnesses (the two women), and uses his intuition (which is divinely inspired according to the previous narrative) to make a decision. The concluding statement shows the real source of legal authority: \u201cWhen all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had decided, they revered the king, for they saw the wisdom of God in him to do justice.\u201d (1 Kings 3:28)</p>\n<p>Here is a helpful quote to understand why the implementation may have been different.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Hebrew Bible strongly suggests that the earliest forms of disputes\u2026 were resolved\u2026 by intuitions of justice against a background of custom, rather than appeal to formulated rules. The biblical sources which talk about the establishment of the judicial system in Israel give no indication that judges were to use written sources. Rather, judges are urged to avoid partiality and corruption and to \u2018do justice.\u2019 But what was the source of such justice? The version attributed to king Jehoshaphat is the most explicit, \u2018God is with you in giving judgment\u2019 (2 Chronicles 19:6). Divine inspiration is also attributed to the king in rendering judgment: Proverbs 16:10, \u2018Inspired decisions are on the lips of a king; his mouth does not sin in judgment.\u2019 Solomon\u2019s judgment (1 Kings 3:16-28) is presented as an example of just such a process\u2026. This is not to say that judges were expected to go into some kind of trance or function as an oracle. Rather, they were called to operate by combining local custom with divinely guided intuitions of justice\u2026relying on the \u2018practical wisdom\u2019 that existed within the social consciousness of the people as a whole.\u201d (Bernard Jackson, Wisdom Laws, 30-31)</p>\n<p>Show Produced by:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\n\u201cDefender Inst.\u201d by Tents<br />\n\u201cShot in the back of the head\u201d by Moby<br />\nSynth Groove<br />\n\u201cScream Pilots\u201d by Moby<br />\n\u201cShine\u201d by Moby<br />\nThird Floor \u2028</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nJoshua Berman, Inconsistency in the Torah<br />\nBernard Jackson, Wisdom Laws<br />\nMartha Tobi Roth, Harry A.

Together in 1838, they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch), which, in their lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word Frucht, 'fruit'.</p>\n<p>Tim points out that the Grimm brothers bridged the gap between folklore and common law in German society into a society of more statutory law in Germany. In many ways, Tim says, this is how Israel came to treat the law. The stories surrounding the laws allowed Israel to illustrate what happens when the rules are or are not followed.</p>\n<p>Examples of Law Implementation in Scripture</p>\n<p>In part 6 (63:00-end), Tim points out that many times in the Bible, the actual implementation of the laws are totally different from the given or written laws. There are many cases where narratives about legal decisions either differ from the statements of practice in the biblical law codes, or the decision is offered without any recourse to a law code.</p>\n<p>For example, in 2 Samuel 14, David gives a ruling contrary to every law and principle in the biblical law codes concerning murder. David simply excuses his son Absalom (who murdered Amnon) with no appeal or defense of his actions and no mention of a law code.</p>\n<p>Another example is found in Jeremiah 26, the most detailed description of a trial in the Old Testament. Jeremiah is accused of treason for announcing the temple\u2019s destruction. His defense is that another prophet before him, Micah, announced the same message and he was never imprisoned. This is an argument from precedent, not from a law code. The arguments advanced against him are offered on theological grounds (\u201che speaks in the name of Yahweh\u201d) and political grounds (\u201che prophesied against our city\u201d). No law codes are ever consulted to defend or accuse him.</p>\n<p>A third example is Solomon\u2019s famous \u201cdecision\u201d about the two women in 1 Kings 3. Solomon listens to the witnesses (the two women), and uses his intuition (which is divinely inspired according to the previous narrative) to make a decision. The concluding statement shows the real source of legal authority: \u201cWhen all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had decided, they revered the king, for they saw the wisdom of God in him to do justice.\u201d (1 Kings 3:28)</p>\n<p>Here is a helpful quote to understand why the implementation may have been different.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Hebrew Bible strongly suggests that the earliest forms of disputes\u2026 were resolved\u2026 by intuitions of justice against a background of custom, rather than appeal to formulated rules. The biblical sources which talk about the establishment of the judicial system in Israel give no indication that judges were to use written sources. Rather, judges are urged to avoid partiality and corruption and to \u2018do justice.\u2019 But what was the source of such justice? The version attributed to king Jehoshaphat is the most explicit, \u2018God is with you in giving judgment\u2019 (2 Chronicles 19:6). Divine inspiration is also attributed to the king in rendering judgment: Proverbs 16:10, \u2018Inspired decisions are on the lips of a king; his mouth does not sin in judgment.\u2019 Solomon\u2019s judgment (1 Kings 3:16-28) is presented as an example of just such a process\u2026. This is not to say that judges were expected to go into some kind of trance or function as an oracle. Rather, they were called to operate by combining local custom with divinely guided intuitions of justice\u2026relying on the \u2018practical wisdom\u2019 that existed within the social consciousness of the people as a whole.\u201d (Bernard Jackson, Wisdom Laws, 30-31)</p>\n<p>Show Produced by:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\n\u201cDefender Inst.\u201d by Tents<br />\n\u201cShot in the back of the head\u201d by Moby<br />\nSynth Groove<br />\n\u201cScream Pilots\u201d by Moby<br />\n\u201cShine\u201d by Moby<br />\nThird Floor \u2028</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nJoshua Berman, Inconsistency in the Torah<br />\nBernard Jackson, Wisdom Laws<br />\nMartha Tobi Roth, Harry A.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "In part 1 (0-21:00), Tim points out that the laws are not a \u201claw code\u201d but terms of a covenant relationship. The laws are not a \u201cconstitutional code\u201d (i.e. a divine behavior manual) dropped from heaven. Rather, they illustrate the official terms of the covenant relationship between Yahweh and the people of ancient Israel. The 613 laws all fall within the ceremony of God\u2019s covenant with Israel in Exodus 19-24.\nTim asks the question: If these laws aren\u2019t a judicial code, then what are they?\nThe laws are the shared agreement between God and Israel that was put forth in their covenant ceremony. We witness this relationship between Israel and Yahweh, Tim shares, as outsiders. People today were not at Mt. Sinai when the covenant was ratified. Instead, the law is used as \u201ctorah\u201d for us, or \u201cinstruction,\u201d meaning they reveal more about ourselves and God and the human condition. The Torah, Tim says, is a narrative about a covenant relationship, not a law code. He points out that there would have inevitably been more rules and laws governing ancient Israel than the 613 laws included in the Bible.\nIn part 2 (21:00-26:00), Tim expresses how the law served as \u201crelational authority\u201d between Israel and God. The laws served as a witness to Israel\u2019s difference from other kingdoms, that they were a \u201ckingdom of priests\u201d who all had a relationship with God.\nAncient Law: Examples from History\nIn part 3, (26:00-41:30) Tim explains that to best understand the ancient laws of Israel, one should also understand how other ancient laws worked. Tim brings up the Code of Hammurabi, the most well known ancient law code. Tim shares the start of the law code of Hammurabi:\n\u201cWhen lofty Anum, king of the Anunnaki and Enlil, lord of heaven and earth, the determiner of the destinies of the land, determined for Marduk, the first-born of Enki, 6 the Enlil supreme powers over all mankind, made him great among the Igigi, called Babylon by its exalted name, He made it supreme in the world, established for him in its midst an enduring kingship, whose foundations are as firm as heaven and earth\u2014\n\u201cat that time Anum and Enlil named me to promote the welfare of the people, me, Hammurabi, the devout, god-fearing prince, to cause justice to prevail in the land, to destroy the wicked and the evil, that the strong might not oppress the weak, to rise like the sun over humankind, and to light up the land.\n\u201cHammurabi, the shepherd, called by Enlil, am I; the one who makes affluence and plenty abound; the one who relaid the foundations of Sippar; who decked with green the chapels of Aya; the designer of the temple of Ebabbar, which is like a heavenly dwelling.\n\u201cWhen the god Marduk commanded me to provide just ways for the people of the land (in order to attain) appropriate behavior, I established truth and justice as the declaration of the land, I enhanced the well-being of the people.\u201d\nThe Epilogue and Prologue to the Law Code [From Martha Tobi Roth, Harry A. Hoffner, and Piotr Michalowski, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor]\nHere are a few laws in the code of Hammurabi:\n#196: \"If a man destroy the eye of another man, they shall destroy his eye. If one break a man's bone, they shall break his bone. If one destroy the eye of a freeman or break the bone of a freeman he shall pay one gold mina. If one destroy the eye of a man's slave or break a bone of a man's slave he shall pay one-half his price.\"\n#250 (xliv 44\u201351) \u201cIf an ox gores to death a man while it is passing through the streets, that case has no basis for a claim.\u201d\n#251 (xliv 52\u201365) \u201cIf a man\u2019s ox is a known gorer, and the authorities of his city quarter notify him that it is a known gorer, but he does not blunt(?) its horns or control his ox, and that ox gores to death a member of the aw\u012blu-class, he (the owner) shall give 30 shekels of silver.\u201d\nHere is the epilogue of the law:\n\u201cMay any king who will appear in the land in the future, at any time, observe the pronouncements of justice that I inscribed upon my stela. May he not alter the judgments that I rendered and the verdicts that I gave, nor remove my engraved image. If that man has discernment, and is capable of providing just ways for his land, may he heed the pronouncements I have inscribed upon my stela.\u201d\nThe Epilogue and Prologue to the Law Code [From Martha Tobi Roth, Harry A. Hoffner, and Piotr Michalowski, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor]\nTim brings up some interesting observations, puzzles and problems that ancient laws present.\nThis code is one of the most frequently copied texts from the ancient world, copies ranging over 1500yrs, and yet, as he quotes:\n\u201cOf the many thousands of Mesopotamian legal documents in our possession, not one of them cites the Code of Hammurabi, or any other \u2018code\u2019 as a source of authority. This in spite of the fact that the code of Hammurabi was esteemed and recopied for more than a millennium. All of this suggests that ancient near eastern law codes were of a literary, educational, and monumental nature, rather than legal and juridical.\u201d (Joshua Berman, Created Equal: 84)\nThe code of Hammurabi was copied and recopied for over a thousand years. But across the centuries, none of the dozens of monetary fines were changed (which they would have if consulted and used for legal purposes). The code is nowhere near comprehensive\u2014you won\u2019t find any laws concerning inheritances, one of the most important features of landed-agricultural life in Babylon. Copies of the Code of Hammurabi have been found in royal archives but never in the sites of local courts, and never with caches of legal documents (receipts, divorce certificates, etc.).\nAdditionally, there are no ancient legal texts that ever cite or even refer to the Code as a source of law. In the thousands of ancient legal texts that do exist and address the same topics as the code, they are usually at odds with the sentences and fines given within it.\nSo, if these compositions were not legal codes, (1) where could the law of the land be found? And if they were not legal codes, (2) what was their purpose?\nTim shares this quote:\n\u201cArchaeologists have unearthed thousands of law-practice documents from the ancient near East, documents such as land transfers, financial contracts, and court rulings where law was applied to actual situations (divorces, civil disputes). There have also been discovered dozens of ancient law codes (Hammurabi, Ur-Namma, Lipit-Ishtar, Eshnunna). A curious problem emerges when these practice documents are compared with the law collections. The law as practiced in those cultures often differed from, even contradicted, the laws as stated in the collections. Penalties found in court decisions are repeatedly inconsistent with the penalties inscribed in the collections. Prices established in contracts don\u2019t match those given in the law codes. This has raised important questions about the purpose of these collections. Whatever their purposes were, they do not appear to have dictated actual legal practice. Scholars have come to see that these law codes as academic and monumental collections, but not the source of law in these societies.\u201d (Michael Lefebvre, Collections, Codes, and Torah, 1)\nTwo Kinds of Law\nIn part 4, (41:30-49:30) Tim explains that the ancient world would have been known as a common or customary law society, whereas our modern world is largely known as a statutory law society. He shares more quotes:\n\u201cThe scholarly consensus is that law in Mesopotamia was customary/common law. A judge would determine the law at the moment of adjudication by drawing on an extensive reservoir of custom, accepted norms, and principles from the legal texts with which he was educated. The law would vary from place to place, and neither the Code of Hammurabi nor any other text was \u2018the final word\u2019 on what law should be applied. Indeed, the association of \u201claw\u201d with a written collection of statutes and rules is a modern anachronistic imposition from our own culture. It is no surprise, therefore, that neither Mesopotamia, Egyptian, or Hittite culture has any word for \u2018written law,\u2019 that we find in later Greek as thesmos, or nomos.\u201d (Joshua Berman, Inconsistency in the Torah, 112-113)\n\u201cThe law collections, instead, are anthologies of judgments from times past, snapshots of decisions and customs rendered by judges or even by a king. The collections were a model of justice meant to educate and inspire\u2026. They were records of precedent, but not of legislation\u2026.they instilled in later generations of scribes a unified legal vision.\u201d (Ibid.)\nTim says this has helped him understand three main purposes of the law:\nJudicial Education texts: Collections of the most common representative decisions from a culture, compiled to train the moral-instincts of leaders, not to legislate actual practice.\nMonumental Propaganda: Like the Code of Hammurabi, the code praises the king\u2019s wisdom and justice and claims that his decisions are in fact divinely inspired.\nEducational texts: These are compilations for training the scribal class, introducing them to a literary tradition of justice. \u2028\nIn part 5 (49:30-63:00), Tim further delineates the differences between common law and statutory law:\nStatutory Law\nCommon Law\nTim shares a helpful metaphor from Sir Matthew Hale (\u201cthe greatest British common-law judge of the 17th century\u201d): The common law can change and yet still be considered part of the same legal \u201csystem\u201d just as a ship can return home after a long voyage and still be considered the \u201csame\u201d ship, even though it returns with many repairs, new materials, and old materials discarded and replaced. In the same saw, law collections create a system of legal reasoning that a judge accesses to apply in new and unanticipated circumstances.\nA Helpful Illustration from History\nCommon law traditions flourished for most of human history, because they require a homogeneous community where a common story and common values are assumed and perpetuated by all members of a society. 19th century German legal theorist Carl von Savigny called this the Volksgeist, \u201cthe collective spirit and conscience of a people.\u201d Where social cohesion breaks down, it becomes more difficult to anchor the law in a collective set of values, and this is what happened in 19th century Europe with the rise of immigration, urbanization, and the modern nation-state.\nNineteenth-century Germany faced transition from a historically tribal state into a modern state (Otto von Bismarck and Carl Savigny continued to advocate the common law tradition of their past). One of his most famous students was Jacob Grimm (1785-1863), best known for his collaboration with his brother Wilhelm. These brothers did exhaustive research into their cultural folklore and produced comprehensive editions of Germany\u2019s moral heritage in their anthology called \u201cKinder und Hausmarchen\u201d = \u201cChildren\u2019s and Household Tales\u201d (2 volumes in 1812 and 1815), including the classic tales of Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin, Sleeping Beauty, and the Frog Prince.\nThe Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies. Between the first edition of 1812-15 and the seventh and final edition of 1857, they revised their collection many times so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200. In addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled German legends. Individually, they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship. Together in 1838, they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch), which, in their lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word Frucht, 'fruit'.\nTim points out that the Grimm brothers bridged the gap between folklore and common law in German society into a society of more statutory law in Germany. In many ways, Tim says, this is how Israel came to treat the law. The stories surrounding the laws allowed Israel to illustrate what happens when the rules are or are not followed.\nExamples of Law Implementation in Scripture\nIn part 6 (63:00-end), Tim points out that many times in the Bible, the actual implementation of the laws are totally different from the given or written laws. There are many cases where narratives about legal decisions either differ from the statements of practice in the biblical law codes, or the decision is offered without any recourse to a law code.\nFor example, in 2 Samuel 14, David gives a ruling contrary to every law and principle in the biblical law codes concerning murder.

In the same saw, law collections create a system of legal reasoning that a judge accesses to apply in new and unanticipated circumstances.\nA Helpful Illustration from History\nCommon law traditions flourished for most of human history, because they require a homogeneous community where a common story and common values are assumed and perpetuated by all members of a society. 19th century German legal theorist Carl von Savigny called this the Volksgeist, \u201cthe collective spirit and conscience of a people.\u201d Where social cohesion breaks down, it becomes more difficult to anchor the law in a collective set of values, and this is what happened in 19th century Europe with the rise of immigration, urbanization, and the modern nation-state.\nNineteenth-century Germany faced transition from a historically tribal state into a modern state (Otto von Bismarck and Carl Savigny continued to advocate the common law tradition of their past). One of his most famous students was Jacob Grimm (1785-1863), best known for his collaboration with his brother Wilhelm. These brothers did exhaustive research into their cultural folklore and produced comprehensive editions of Germany\u2019s moral heritage in their anthology called \u201cKinder und Hausmarchen\u201d = \u201cChildren\u2019s and Household Tales\u201d (2 volumes in 1812 and 1815), including the classic tales of Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin, Sleeping Beauty, and the Frog Prince.\nThe Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies. Between the first edition of 1812-15 and the seventh and final edition of 1857, they revised their collection many times so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200. In addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled German legends. Individually, they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship. Together in 1838, they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch), which, in their lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word Frucht, 'fruit'.\nTim points out that the Grimm brothers bridged the gap between folklore and common law in German society into a society of more statutory law in Germany. In many ways, Tim says, this is how Israel came to treat the law. The stories surrounding the laws allowed Israel to illustrate what happens when the rules are or are not followed.\nExamples of Law Implementation in Scripture\nIn part 6 (63:00-end), Tim points out that many times in the Bible, the actual implementation of the laws are totally different from the given or written laws. There are many cases where narratives about legal decisions either differ from the statements of practice in the biblical law codes, or the decision is offered without any recourse to a law code.\nFor example, in 2 Samuel 14, David gives a ruling contrary to every law and principle in the biblical law codes concerning murder. David simply excuses his son Absalom (who murdered Amnon) with no appeal or defense of his actions and no mention of a law code.\nAnother example is found in Jeremiah 26, the most detailed description of a trial in the Old Testament. Jeremiah is accused of treason for announcing the temple\u2019s destruction. His defense is that another prophet before him, Micah, announced the same message and he was never imprisoned. This is an argument from precedent, not from a law code. The arguments advanced against him are offered on theological grounds (\u201che speaks in the name of Yahweh\u201d) and political grounds (\u201che prophesied against our city\u201d). No law codes are ever consulted to defend or accuse him.\nA third example is Solomon\u2019s famous \u201cdecision\u201d about the two women in 1 Kings 3. Solomon listens to the witnesses (the two women), and uses his intuition (which is divinely inspired according to the previous narrative) to make a decision. The concluding statement shows the real source of legal authority: \u201cWhen all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had decided, they revered the king, for they saw the wisdom of God in him to do justice.\u201d (1 Kings 3:28)\nHere is a helpful quote to understand why the implementation may have been different.\n\u201cThe Hebrew Bible strongly suggests that the earliest forms of disputes\u2026 were resolved\u2026 by intuitions of justice against a background of custom, rather than appeal to formulated rules. The biblical sources which talk about the establishment of the judicial system in Israel give no indication that judges were to use written sources. Rather, judges are urged to avoid partiality and corruption and to \u2018do justice.\u2019 But what was the source of such justice? The version attributed to king Jehoshaphat is the most explicit, \u2018God is with you in giving judgment\u2019 (2 Chronicles 19:6). Divine inspiration is also attributed to the king in rendering judgment: Proverbs 16:10, \u2018Inspired decisions are on the lips of a king; his mouth does not sin in judgment.\u2019 Solomon\u2019s judgment (1 Kings 3:16-28) is presented as an example of just such a process\u2026. This is not to say that judges were expected to go into some kind of trance or function as an oracle. Rather, they were called to operate by combining local custom with divinely guided intuitions of justice\u2026relying on the \u2018practical wisdom\u2019 that existed within the social consciousness of the people as a whole.\u201d (Bernard Jackson, Wisdom Laws, 30-31)\nShow Produced by:\nShow Music:\n\u201cDefender Inst.\u201d by Tents\n\u201cShot in the back of the head\u201d by Moby\nSynth Groove\n\u201cScream Pilots\u201d by Moby\n\u201cShine\u201d by Moby\nThird Floor \u2028\nShow Resources:\nJoshua Berman, Inconsistency in the Torah\nBernard Jackson, Wisdom Laws\nMartha Tobi Roth, Harry A.

            "content": "<p>Welcome to our first episode looking at laws in the Bible!<br />\nIn part 1 (0-4:00), Tim explains how this set of conversations will be different than the previous podcast episodes that looked at biblical law (the first two episodes of this podcast).<br />\nIn parts 2 and 3 (4:00-17:45 and 17:45-35:00), Tim and Jon discuss ancient law vs. modern law. They talk about the importance of biblical law, but how these laws often cause hang-ups for modern readers. Tim notes that for centuries, interpreting biblical law has been a major point of debate among Christians, Jews, and everyone else.<br />\nIn part 4 (35:00-end), Tim explains a debate over the number of laws in the Old Testament Torah. Some say there are 611 commands; others say 613. So which is it?<br />\nThis is one small but significant example that illustrates how important interpreting the law was in Israel. Here\u2019s a glimpse into the debate to give you a fuller picture.<br />\nA few centuries after Jesus, rabbis still firmly held to both views. The main disagreement came down to two passages where a commandment could be implicitly read. Consider:<br />\nExodus 20:1, \u201cI am Yahweh your God\u201d = Believe that Yahweh exists.<br />\nDeuteronomy 6:5, \u201cYahweh your God, Yahweh is one\u201d = Believe that Yahweh is one.<br />\nYet even though the number of laws in the Torah can be debated, early rabbis recognized the ability to \u201creduce\u201d many laws to just a handful that fully captured the spirit of the law. A famous passage illustrates this in the Babylonian Talmud (one of the primary sources for interpreting Jewish religious law and theology). It states:<br />\nSix hundred and thirteen commandments were given to Moses.<br />\nDavid reduced those commandments to eleven. (Psalm 15)<br />\nIsaiah reduced them to six. (Isaiah 33:15-16)<br />\nMicah the prophet reduced them to three. (Micah 6:8)<br />\nIsaiah again reduced them to two. (Isaiah 56:1)<br />\nAmos reduced them to one. (Amos 5:4)<br />\nHabakkuk further reduces to say, \u201cBut the righteous shall live by his faith.\u201d (Habakkuk 2:4)<br />\nThroughout the episode, Tim highlights differences in the law. For example, Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 (both presenting the Ten Commandments) talk about the Sabbath in slightly different ways.<br />\nOr consider another instance, where Moses gives two different commands about how to prepare the Passover. Should you roast it or boil it? According to Exodus 12:8-9, you should roast it and not boil it. But in Deuteronomy 16:6-7, Moses tells the people to boil it.<br />\nThese problems we see in the law are more than just ancient interpretation. To modern readers, some of the laws seem noble and inspiring, while others seem odd, primitive, or even barbaric.<br />\nWe encounter all three of these examples in two adjacent chapters in the Torah:<br />\nIn Leviticus 19, we read about God\u2019s command to leave the extra gleanings of the harvest for the needy and stranger. God shows his care for the least of these.<br />\nA few verses later, we find laws about tattoos and beard etiquette. Weird!<br />\nOne chapter later, we read the command that \u201ca medium or a spiritist shall surely be put to death.\u201d (Leviticus 20:27)<br />\nNow these laws leave us feeling a tension around how to understand the idea of \u201cbiblical authority.\u201d What does obedience to the laws of the Torah mean? Do we obey all of them, some of them, or none of them?<br />\nThis issue has caused many conflicts in both Jewish and Christian history. For example, what is a Jew supposed to do about sacrificial ritual laws when the temple is destroyed in 586 B.C.? Or for a follower of Jesus, how do these laws relate to us as the messianic new covenant family?<br />\nWe see that Jesus said, \u201cDo not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.\u201d (Matthew 5:17) So what can Paul mean when he says, \u201cFor Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.\u201d (Romans 10:4) Yet Paul still quotes from the Ten Commandments in places like Ephesians 6:1-3.<br />\nOverall, Tim makes the case that the law presented to us in the Old Testament is not a \u201ccode\u201d in the same way modern readers often think of a law code. Instead, we see how Moses, the prophets, Paul, and even Jesus handled the laws. Each held a deep respect for the underlying meaning and ideals presented by the law to the people of God.

            "content": "<p>Welcome to Episode 2 in our series on How to Read the Prophets.</p>\n<p>In the introduction, Tim says that the books of the prophets can be set up in different ways, but in most cases they are anthologies. These are the greatest hits or most important points of the prophets.</p>\n<p>There are five parts to this episode where Tim outlines several buckets or themes that are important to understand when reading the prophets.<br />\n(6:00-25:00) Introduction<br />\n(25:00-33:00) Bucket 1: Accusations<br />\n(33:00-37:00) Bucket 2: Repentance<br />\n(37:00-52:00) Bucket 3: Day of the Lord Announcements<br />\n(52:00-end) Conclusion</p>\n<p>Biblical prophecy frequently deals with the following themes:</p>\n<p>Accusations that Israel and the nations have rebelled against Yahweh.<br />\nIsrael/Judah has (1) broken the covenant, (2) worshiped other gods, (3) allowed social injustice, and (4) made alliances with the foreign nations. The covenant lawsuit is the key rhetorical device. And the key metaphor is idolatry as adultery. So the nations are accused of injustice, cruelty, and arrogance.</p>\n<p>A second bucket or theme is the calls for repentance and admonition to turn from wicked ways and return to faithful obedience to Yahweh. The prophets call for religious devotion to Yahweh alone and no other gods. They also call for social justice and care for the most vulnerable (widow, orphan, immigrant).</p>\n<p>The third theme is the announcements of the Day of the Lord that will address injustice and rebellion. This refers to historical events that God will use to judge evil and vindicate the righteous, all leading up to the great future day when God will do this for all creation\u2014a cosmic \u201chouse-cleaning.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bad news the prophets deliver is that Yahweh will bring his justice against human rebellion. Because of human hard-heartedness, future punishment becomes inevitable. The punishment will be upon Israel and Judah, resulting in disaster, defeat, and exile upon individual nations (especially Assyrian, Babylon, Egypt) and upon all nations.</p>\n<p>The good news is that Yahweh will bring about the restoration of his covenant people on the other side of exile. This is a hope for a righteous remnant. The prophets say that God will preserve a faithful remnant, an important minority who remain faithful. There is hope for restoration from exile (captivity), and God will restore their \u201cfortunes.\u201d Finally, there is hope for a new covenant. Yahweh will renew his covenant with his people.</p>\n<p>The prophets say that the Kingdom of God will appear and Yahweh will establish his peaceful, universal Kingdom over all nations, ruled by the future messianic King.</p>\n<p>They use the imagery of a new temple, new Eden, and new Jerusalem to represent God\u2019s personal presence that will permeate his people in a new cosmic temple.</p>\n<p>Helpful tips: How to Read the Prophets</p>\n<p>Look at the first sentence of the book to see when the prophet lived, then go read the corresponding section of 1-2 Kings to get the context of the prophet\u2019s day.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to the three main themes and how they connect to the book\u2019s design. Some prophets put all their poems of accusation together (as in Ezekiel 3-24), while others weave poems of accusation and of future hope together (see Isaiah 1-2).</p>\n<p>These books are mostly poetry, so read slowly and thoughtfully. They use tons of metaphors, so pay attention to repeated words and images.<br />\nIsaiah uses metaphors from the plant world more than any other prophet (vines, trees, branches, stumps, flowers, grass) and often in creative ways to make different points (See Isaiah 11).</p>\n<p>Key Insights from the prophets:<br />\nGod loves justice. Israel had been called to a higher level of justice than the nations around them, especially in the treatment of their land and the poor (See Isaiah 1:10-20).</p>\n<p>God gets angry at evil.

Tim shares quotes from Martin Luther and fJohn Bright:</p>\n<p>The challenge of reading the prophetic books:<br />\n\u201cThe prophets have an odd way of talking, like people who, instead of proceeding in an orderly manner, ramble off from one thing to the next, so that you cannot make head or tail of them or see what they are getting at.\u201d<br />\nMartin Luther, quoted in Gerhard von Rad, Old Testament Theology, Vol. 2 (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965), 33.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes the prophetic books particularly, and one might say needlessly, difficult is the very manner of their arrangement \u2014 or, to be more accurate, their apparent lack of arrangement\u2026 All seems confusion\u2026 The impression that the reader gains is one of extreme disarray; one can scarcely blame him for concluding that he is reading a hopeless hodgepodge thrown together without any discernible principle of arrangement at all.\u201d \u2014 John Bright, Jeremiah (Anchor Bible Commentary, 1965), p. lvi.</p>\n<p>In part two (10:00-18:40), Tim asks Jon what he thinks a modern definition of prophets and prophecy is. Jon says he believes it has to do with fortune telling. A prophet is someone who can look into the future and predict an event.</p>\n<p>Tim explains that while this is part of the role of a prophet, it is not the central focus, and predicting future events only occurs occasionally in the Bible.</p>\n<p>Tim explains that the definition of a prophet in the Old Testament is actually very simple. A prophet is simply a messenger or a herald giving a message to people on God\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>Tim says that most people understand the term prophecy as the prediction of future events. This definition is inadequate and does not account for the huge amounts of the material in the prophetic books. While there are certain passages within the prophets which do contain predictive elements, most of these poems and narratives don\u2019t present themselves as predictive prophecy.</p>\n<p>In the Bible, a prophecy is a message that God speaks to his people through a human prophet. So prophecies often contain the quoted speech of God himself.<br />\nJeremiah 2:1-2:<br />\nNow the word of the Lord came to me saying,<br />\n\u201cGo and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying,<br />\n\u2018Thus says the Lord: \u201cI remember concerning you the devotion of your youth\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>In part three (18:40-33:30), Tim outlines the character of Moses. Moses is portrayed as the archetypal prophet. He\u2019s the first divine spokesmen sent to Israel and the nations (Exodus 3). He\u2019s the first figure to mediate between Yahweh and Israel and establish his covenant with the people (Exodus 19-24, the Sinai narrative). He\u2019s the only figure allowed to enter the divine presence directly (Exodus 19-20, 33-34). He\u2019s the key intercessor for Israel when they have violated the covenant (Exodus 32-34). He suffers because of Israel\u2019s failures (Numbers 11-21) and accuses them of present and ongoing rebellion against Yahweh that will result in exile (Deuteronomy 28-32).<br />\nAnd his death is marked as the end of an era. \u201cSince that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face\u2026\u201d (Deuteronomy 34:10).</p>\n<p>Tim says that Moses fails as a prophet. But in the Pentateuch, he is cast<br />\nas the ideal prophet, someone whom all other Jewish prophets should follow after.</p>\n<p>In part four (33:30-end), Tim says the prophets are best understood as \u201ccovenant watchdogs.\u201d They assume the larger covenant story of Yahweh, creation, and Israel. Yahweh is the creator and King, and his image-bearing stewards have rebelled and corrupted his good world (Genesis 1\u201311).</p>\n<p>In the covenant he makes with Abraham, Yahweh says he will use Abraham\u2019s family to restore his divine blessing to all nations (Genesis 12).</p>\n<p>In the covenant with Israel (the Sinai or Mosaic covenant), Israel is called to become a kingdom of priests to the nations by adhering to the laws of the covenant. Obedience will result in covenant blessing, and rebellion will bring covenant curses (Exod 19, Lev 26, Deut 28\u201330).</p>\n<p>In the covenant with Israel\u2019s priesthood, Yahweh promises to provide a perpetual priesthood through the line of Aaron to intercede on Israel\u2019s behalf and atone for their covenant failures (Numbers 25).</p>\n<p>The covenant with Israel\u2019s monarchy states that Yahweh will raise up a king from the line of David who will bring God\u2019s Kingdom and blessing to all the nations (2 Samuel 7, Psalms 2, 72, 89, 132).</p>\n<p>Israel was unable to fulfill its side of the Sinai covenant and was sent into exile. But in the new covenant, Yahweh will transform their hearts so they can truly love and obey their God (Deuteronomy 30, Jeremiah 31, Ezekiel 36).</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of our supporters!</p>\n<p>Show Produced by:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins</p>\n<p>Show Music<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents<br />\nMind Your Time, Me.So<br />\nMorning, LiQwyd<br />\nErhrling, Typhoon</p>\n<p>Show Resources:</p>\n<p>Martin Luther, quoted in Gerhard von Rad, Old Testament Theology, Vol. 2 (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965), 33.</p>\n<p>John Bright, Jeremiah (Anchor Bible Commentary, 1965), p.

While there are certain passages within the prophets which do contain predictive elements, most of these poems and narratives don\u2019t present themselves as predictive prophecy.</p>\n<p>In the Bible, a prophecy is a message that God speaks to his people through a human prophet. So prophecies often contain the quoted speech of God himself.<br />\nJeremiah 2:1-2:<br />\nNow the word of the Lord came to me saying,<br />\n\u201cGo and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying,<br />\n\u2018Thus says the Lord: \u201cI remember concerning you the devotion of your youth\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>In part three (18:40-33:30), Tim outlines the character of Moses. Moses is portrayed as the archetypal prophet. He\u2019s the first divine spokesmen sent to Israel and the nations (Exodus 3). He\u2019s the first figure to mediate between Yahweh and Israel and establish his covenant with the people (Exodus 19-24, the Sinai narrative). He\u2019s the only figure allowed to enter the divine presence directly (Exodus 19-20, 33-34). He\u2019s the key intercessor for Israel when they have violated the covenant (Exodus 32-34). He suffers because of Israel\u2019s failures (Numbers 11-21) and accuses them of present and ongoing rebellion against Yahweh that will result in exile (Deuteronomy 28-32).<br />\nAnd his death is marked as the end of an era. \u201cSince that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face\u2026\u201d (Deuteronomy 34:10).</p>\n<p>Tim says that Moses fails as a prophet. But in the Pentateuch, he is cast<br />\nas the ideal prophet, someone whom all other Jewish prophets should follow after.</p>\n<p>In part four (33:30-end), Tim says the prophets are best understood as \u201ccovenant watchdogs.\u201d They assume the larger covenant story of Yahweh, creation, and Israel. Yahweh is the creator and King, and his image-bearing stewards have rebelled and corrupted his good world (Genesis 1\u201311).</p>\n<p>In the covenant he makes with Abraham, Yahweh says he will use Abraham\u2019s family to restore his divine blessing to all nations (Genesis 12).</p>\n<p>In the covenant with Israel (the Sinai or Mosaic covenant), Israel is called to become a kingdom of priests to the nations by adhering to the laws of the covenant.

Luke has provided a theological history that traces the spread of the good news from Jerusalem to Rome, from the eastern edge of the Roman Empire into its very heart. Rome was not seen in Luke\u2019s day as the edge of the known world, and so the reader would know very well that Jesus\u2019 mission to spread the gospel to the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8) was still ongoing in his own day.

One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea. This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says that this is hugely symbolic.

But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace.\u201d \u2013 Ephesians 2:12-15.</p>\n<p>Tim says that this passage is more evidence that Paul really wanted Jews and Gentiles to be united as one Church.</p>\n<p>Then in reference to Ephesians 3, Tim says that for Paul, the creation of the new humanity through Christ is the way that God also chooses to demonstrate his wisdom to the divine council.<br />\n\u201cAlthough I am less than the least of all the Lord\u2019s people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ, and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.

Here are the questions we responded to:</p>\n<p>Matt from Australia: (0:55)<br />\nI've got a question about humans and animals. It seems like animals get a really bad rap. You've been talking about when humans don't pass the test or live as they're made to live, they're not truly the image of God, they act less than human or to be true, they act like animals. And I'm wondering what about animals is so bad or so wrong? Or are you trying to communicate about a different reality than an animal? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Petra from the Netherlands: (6:20)<br />\nIn the podcast (The Empty Throne), Tim refers to the Empty Throne in Daniel 7, but if I read Daniel 7 in different translations, vs 9 says &quot;thrones&quot; and vs 10 &quot;the court place.&quot; So I get the conclusion that thrones are set for the court. In Matthew 19:28, Jesus tells his disciples that they will sit on the 12 thrones and judge the 12 tribes of Israel. I don't assume that's specific because in Revelation it says 24. My question is, where do you get the conclusion that the empty throne refers to the Son of Man because I come to the conclusion that it refers to the court. Thank you!</p>\n<p>Rachel from Delaware: (12:35)<br />\nThis is a question I've always had: where is Daniel in Daniel 3?</p>\n<p>Stephanie from Virginia: (21:05)<br />\nMy question is, why is Daniel portrayed as a new human, a new Adam, when he is not THE new human, the Messiah to come?</p>\n<p>John from North Wales: (21:20)<br />\nI've found this series on the Son of Man really exciting. I have a question about Daniel. I was struck when you were taking us through those first chapters in the book of Daniel that Daniel himself actually seems to be a flawless human being. My working paradigm was that there are no heroes in the Old Testament except for God himself, but Daniel does actually seems to pass the test (or at least to not really fail the test at any particular point). So how do you interpret the figure of Daniel? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Sam from Ohio: (26:04)<br />\nIn Daniel 7:18, 22, 27, it speaks of the saints being given the dominion and kingdom to possess forever. Verse 27 ends by saying, &quot;All dominions shall serve and obey them.&quot; But the ESV footnote says it might end by saying, &quot;All dominions shall serve and obey him.&quot; Is it a possible interpretation to view the Son of Man as a figurative representation of all the saints of the Most High rather than a specific individual? Or what is the connection between the individual and the collective groups of saints? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Douglas from Rwanda: (40:15)<br />\nI was curious about the use of the word &quot;son of man&quot; in other Old Testament books such as Ezekiel. Ezekiel appears to be written before Daniel and they use the exact same word &quot;son of man.&quot; I wonder if you know if it has a different meaning, and if not, how is it related to Daniel's use of &quot;son of man?&quot; Thank you!</p>\n<p>Ivan from El Salvador: (43:20)<br />\nI love the conversation about the Son of God and how he's someone God gave that title.

            "content": "<p>In part one (0:00-13:15), Tim and Jon briefly recap the series so far. Then Tim says that there are three different nuances that Jesus uses when describing himself as the Son of Man.</p>\n<p>The first nuance is Jesus calling himself the Son of Man when saying that he has divine authority. Here\u2019s an example from Mark 2:8-12:<br />\n&quot;Immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, said to them, \u201cWhy are you reasoning about these things in your hearts? \u201cWhich is easier, to say to the paralytic, \u2018Your sins are forgiven\u2019; or to say, \u2018Get up, and pick up your pallet and walk\u2019? \u201cBut so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014He said to the paralytic, \u201cI say to you, get up, pick up your pallet and go home.\u201d And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, \u201cWe have never seen anything like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says that when Jesus says, \u201cThe son of man has authority on earth,\u201d it is recalling Adam/humanity's forfeited authority over the land/earth in Genesis 1.<br />\nIn the story, Jesus steps in as an Adam figure and also a high priest figure. The major part of the priests' job is to intercede for sinners and offer sacrifices of atonement for them. Jesus picks up the Adam-priest mantle in this story.</p>\n<p>Tim quotes from scholar Joel Marcus: \u201cAdam was created to be the terrestrial representative of the heavenly king, to rule on earth as God rules in heaven\u2026 Jesus here emphasizes that his authority to forgive sin on earth derives its ultimate authority from God\u2019s prerogative to forgive sins in heaven\u2026 The first Adam is associated with both royal rule and with sin and death, and so here Jesus is portrayed as the royal human who has power over both sin and death.\u201d -- Joel Marcus, Son of Man as Son of Adam, 372-373.</p>\n<p>In part two (13:15-26:30), the guys dive into another example from Mark 2:23-28:<br />\n&quot;And it happened that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads of grain. The Pharisees were saying to Him, \u201cLook, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?\u201d And He *said to them, \u201cHave you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions became hungry; how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he also gave it to those who were with him?\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cThe Sabbath was made because of the human, and not the human because of the Sabbath. So the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim observes that the Sabbath in Genesis 1 is an ideal of new creation that the first Adam never fully attained, and so it remained to be attained by a future son of man. Jesus is claiming to be that one. Tim quotes from Joel Marcus again: \u201cFrom Genesis itself, to be sure, one might get the impression that the Sabbath was not created \u201cbecause of the human,\u201d but \u201cfor/because of God.\u201d God rested on the seventh day from the labor of the preceding six, and therefore hallowed the seventh day in perpetuity\u2026 However, in Jewish tradition, scholars went to great pains to make clear that God wasn\u2019t tired...but that the purpose of the Sabbath was for humanity, to provide rest for them\u2026 A similar line of thought is found here in Mark 2, the Sabbath was created for Adam\u2019s sake and for the humanity he represents, not the other way around. The Sabbath was built into the structure of the world that was made subject to Adam. Therefore, Adam\u2019s final son (the son of man), who has recovered dominion that his great forefather had forfeited, is the Lord not only of the world in general, but of the Sabbath in particular.\u201d -- Joel Marcus, The Son of Man as the Son of Adam, 375-376.</p>\n<p>In part three (26:30-36:00), Tim talks about the second nuance that Jesus uses when referring to himself as the Son of Man; he describes himself as suffering. The guys examine Mark 10:35-45:<br />\n&quot;James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, *came up to Jesus, saying, \u201cTeacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.\u201d And He said to them, \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d They said to Him, \u201cGrant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.\u201d But Jesus said to them, \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?\u201d They said to Him, \u201cWe are able.\u201d And Jesus said to them, \u201cThe cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized. \u201cBut to sit on My right or on My left, this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John. Calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, \u201cYou know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. \u201cBut it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant; and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all. \u201cFor even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim cites Joel Marcus again saying that Mark 10:45 may be paraphrased as such: \u201cLike his great ancestor Adam before the fall, the Son of Adam had the right and authority to be served, as ruler of all creatures on earth. But instead of exercising this right, the Son of Man has become the slave of all humanity, even to the point of dying for them. In so doing, he has reversed the effect of Adam\u2019s sin, the death which he passed onto his offspring; the one Son of Adam has given his life as a ransom for the many children of Adam who were deprived of their life by the transgression of \u201cthe human.\u201d -- Joel Marcus, Son of God as Son of Adam.</p>\n<p>In part four (36:00-43:15), Tim continues examining this story by Jesus. Jesus believes that he, as the Son of Man is going to rule by serving and suffering. Tim says that this idea becomes significant when thinking about the Christian tradition of baptism. It is a symbolic representation of following Christ through the veil of death to be resurrected to new, real, eternal life after.</p>\n<p>In part five (43:15-59:50), Tim points out the third nuance that Jesus uses to show himself as the Son of Man: the Son of Man will be vindicated after death. Jon notes that understanding these nuances really helps to fill in a lot of the blanks that round out Jesus' identity and actions.</p>\n<p>In part six (59:50-end), Tim and Jon recap the whole series. Tim shares a final quote from Joel Marcus:<br />\n\u201cThe Son of Man\u201d is an apocalyptic symbolic figure. It the Son of Man is a new Adam, then the Jesus of the Gospels presents himself as the founder of a new humanity.

Then Tim says that there are three different nuances that Jesus uses when describing himself as the Son of Man.</p>\n<p>The first nuance is Jesus calling himself the Son of Man when saying that he has divine authority. Here\u2019s an example from Mark 2:8-12:<br />\n&quot;Immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, said to them, \u201cWhy are you reasoning about these things in your hearts? \u201cWhich is easier, to say to the paralytic, \u2018Your sins are forgiven\u2019; or to say, \u2018Get up, and pick up your pallet and walk\u2019? \u201cBut so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014He said to the paralytic, \u201cI say to you, get up, pick up your pallet and go home.\u201d And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, \u201cWe have never seen anything like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says that when Jesus says, \u201cThe son of man has authority on earth,\u201d it is recalling Adam/humanity's forfeited authority over the land/earth in Genesis 1.<br />\nIn the story, Jesus steps in as an Adam figure and also a high priest figure. The major part of the priests' job is to intercede for sinners and offer sacrifices of atonement for them. Jesus picks up the Adam-priest mantle in this story.</p>\n<p>Tim quotes from scholar Joel Marcus: \u201cAdam was created to be the terrestrial representative of the heavenly king, to rule on earth as God rules in heaven\u2026 Jesus here emphasizes that his authority to forgive sin on earth derives its ultimate authority from God\u2019s prerogative to forgive sins in heaven\u2026 The first Adam is associated with both royal rule and with sin and death, and so here Jesus is portrayed as the royal human who has power over both sin and death.\u201d -- Joel Marcus, Son of Man as Son of Adam, 372-373.</p>\n<p>In part two (13:15-26:30), the guys dive into another example from Mark 2:23-28:<br />\n&quot;And it happened that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads of grain. The Pharisees were saying to Him, \u201cLook, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?\u201d And He *said to them, \u201cHave you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions became hungry; how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he also gave it to those who were with him?\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cThe Sabbath was made because of the human, and not the human because of the Sabbath. So the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim observes that the Sabbath in Genesis 1 is an ideal of new creation that the first Adam never fully attained, and so it remained to be attained by a future son of man. Jesus is claiming to be that one. Tim quotes from Joel Marcus again: \u201cFrom Genesis itself, to be sure, one might get the impression that the Sabbath was not created \u201cbecause of the human,\u201d but \u201cfor/because of God.\u201d God rested on the seventh day from the labor of the preceding six, and therefore hallowed the seventh day in perpetuity\u2026 However, in Jewish tradition, scholars went to great pains to make clear that God wasn\u2019t tired...but that the purpose of the Sabbath was for humanity, to provide rest for them\u2026 A similar line of thought is found here in Mark 2, the Sabbath was created for Adam\u2019s sake and for the humanity he represents, not the other way around. The Sabbath was built into the structure of the world that was made subject to Adam. Therefore, Adam\u2019s final son (the son of man), who has recovered dominion that his great forefather had forfeited, is the Lord not only of the world in general, but of the Sabbath in particular.\u201d -- Joel Marcus, The Son of Man as the Son of Adam, 375-376.</p>\n<p>In part three (26:30-36:00), Tim talks about the second nuance that Jesus uses when referring to himself as the Son of Man; he describes himself as suffering. The guys examine Mark 10:35-45:<br />\n&quot;James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, *came up to Jesus, saying, \u201cTeacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.\u201d And He said to them, \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d They said to Him, \u201cGrant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.\u201d But Jesus said to them, \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?\u201d They said to Him, \u201cWe are able.\u201d And Jesus said to them, \u201cThe cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized. \u201cBut to sit on My right or on My left, this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John. Calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, \u201cYou know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. \u201cBut it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant; and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all. \u201cFor even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim cites Joel Marcus again saying that Mark 10:45 may be paraphrased as such: \u201cLike his great ancestor Adam before the fall, the Son of Adam had the right and authority to be served, as ruler of all creatures on earth. But instead of exercising this right, the Son of Man has become the slave of all humanity, even to the point of dying for them. In so doing, he has reversed the effect of Adam\u2019s sin, the death which he passed onto his offspring; the one Son of Adam has given his life as a ransom for the many children of Adam who were deprived of their life by the transgression of \u201cthe human.\u201d -- Joel Marcus, Son of God as Son of Adam.</p>\n<p>In part four (36:00-43:15), Tim continues examining this story by Jesus. Jesus believes that he, as the Son of Man is going to rule by serving and suffering. Tim says that this idea becomes significant when thinking about the Christian tradition of baptism. It is a symbolic representation of following Christ through the veil of death to be resurrected to new, real, eternal life after.</p>\n<p>In part five (43:15-59:50), Tim points out the third nuance that Jesus uses to show himself as the Son of Man: the Son of Man will be vindicated after death. Jon notes that understanding these nuances really helps to fill in a lot of the blanks that round out Jesus' identity and actions.</p>\n<p>In part six (59:50-end), Tim and Jon recap the whole series. Tim shares a final quote from Joel Marcus:<br />\n\u201cThe Son of Man\u201d is an apocalyptic symbolic figure. It the Son of Man is a new Adam, then the Jesus of the Gospels presents himself as the founder of a new humanity. This is why the Gospel authors depict Jesus as carrying out his ministry in the \u201clast days\u201d, as the recapitulation and perfection of \u201cthe beginning.\u201d In this context, the good news of Jesus\u2019 opening message in Mark 1:15 (\u201cThe time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near!\u201d) is not simply that time of waiting for a new event to happen is over.

Tim remarks that there is a whole field of scholarship dedicated to studying how Christ is portrayed as a new Adam or a new Son of Man.</p>\n<p>Tim focuses on Jesus in the Gospel of Mark.<br />\nMark 1:12-13:<br />\n\u201cImmediately the Spirit cast out into the wilderness. And He was in the wilderness forty days being tested by the Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim notes that the phrase \u201ccast out\u201d (Grk. \u03b5\u03ba\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9) is first used in the Old Testament account of Adam and Eve\u2019s explusion from the garden of Eden (Gen 3:24). He also says that both of these stories are meant to be analagous to each other. Jesus is in the wilderness (garden) with the wild animals (Adam and Eve) in the presence of the angels (cherubim and cosmic mountain).</p>\n<p>Tim cites a quote by biblical scholar Brandon Crowe: \u201cWhereas Adam failed the temptation in the garden and was cast out, Jesus is led by the Spirit into the wilderness, a setting associated with Israel\u2019s testing and failure. Unlike Adam, Jesus does not fail the test, and in both stories of Adam and Jesus \u201cexpulsion\u201d the same Greek word ekballo is employed. In the wilderness, Jesus is with the wild animals, but remains unharmed [T.M. like Daniel], which is supposed to strike the reader as unusual. Jesus\u2019 peaceful coexistence with the wild animals signifies his authority over them, and recalls Adam\u2019s original dominion over the animals in the garden. Like Adam, Jesus has been granted the worldwide dominion, becoming the instrument of God\u2019s dominion over the world.\u201d -- Brandon Crowe, The Last Adam: A Theology of the Obedient Life of Jesus in the Gospels, 24</p>\n<p>Tim points out that the temptation of Jesus in Mark, specifically the details of the angels serving him and him being with the wild beasts, is meant to show that Jesus is the new Adam, the perfect Adam who can coexist peacefully with animals in the wild.</p>\n<p>Further, Tim points out that Jesus is portrayed as having authority over the other spiritual beings (angels) to show that Jesus is the ideal Son of Man figure.</p>\n<p>In part two (19:00-18:30), Tim and Jon take a side tour and discuss how in Hebrew there are places where the Hebrew word adam can refer to either a specific character, Adam, or to humanity as a whole. The guys also discuss the nuances between the terms Son of Man and Son of God. Tim notes that Psalm 2 is a key passage for understanding how both of these terms link together.<br />\nTo be called the image of God as humanity means to be the creatures where heaven and earth are bound together.<br />\nPsalm 2: \u201cWhy do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying, \u2018Let us break their chains and throw off their shackles.\u2019 The One enthroned in heaven laughs, the Lord scoffs at them. He rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying, \u2018I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain.\u2019 I will proclaim the Lord\u2019s decree: He said to me, \u2018You are my son; today I have become your father.<br />\nAsk me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>In part three (18:30-end), Jon asks why heaven and earth are supposed to be ideally imaged in humanity. Tim replies that humanity is meant to be related to the elohim. We are not elohim, but we are to share in a similar status of having a divine ability to rule.</p>\n<p>Tim and Jon then dive into the temptation of Jesus portrayed in Matthew 4:8-11:<br />\n\u201cAgain, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; and he said to Him, \u201cAll these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.\u201d<br />\nThen Jesus said to him, \u201cGo, Satan! For it is written, \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.\u2019 \u201d Then the devil left Him; and behold, angels came and began to minister to Him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim notes that there is only one other time in the New Testament where Jesus utters the phrase, \u201cGet behind me Satan\u201d or \u201cGo, Satan\u201d (in the NIV). It\u2019s in Matthew 16:23: \u201cJesus turned and said to Peter, &quot;Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim notes that Jesus obviously sees that a satanic mindset is one where the mindset is human-focused and set on how a beast would rule the world, one of power and strength not of sacrifice.</p>\n<p>Tim points out that after these temptations, you are supposed to see Jesus as a new Adam. He peacefully coexists with animals. He\u2019s a new Daniel; he doesn\u2019t bow down to the rulers. He\u2019s a new David because he rules righteously.

            "content": "<p>In part one (0:00-12:00), the guys quickly recap the biblical story leading up to Daniel 7. There are many models of the Son of Man in the Old Testament: Noah, Moses, David, Joshua. They all get close, but they ultimately fail and are not able to be the perfect \u201cseed of the woman\u201d that will crush the snake and fulfill the prophecy given in Genesis after the fall.</p>\n<p>In part two (12:00-29:30), the guys dive into Daniel 7:<br />\nIn the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream.<br />\nDaniel said: \u201cIn my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea. \u201cThe first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it. \u201cAnd there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, \u2018Get up and eat your fill of flesh!\u2019 \u201cAfter that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.</p>\n<p>After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast\u2014terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. \u201cWhile I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully.<br />\nAs I looked,<br />\nthrones were set in place,<br />\nand the Ancient of Days took his seat.<br />\nHis clothing was as white as snow;<br />\nthe hair of his head was white like wool.<br />\nHis throne was flaming with fire,<br />\nand its wheels were all ablaze.<br />\nA river of fire was flowing,<br />\ncoming out from before him.<br />\nThousands upon thousands attended him;<br />\nten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.<br />\nThe court was seated,<br />\nand the books were opened.</p>\n<p>Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)</p>\n<p>In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Tim makes the following observations: The animals are like an anti-creation. They are extremely non-kosher animals. They are mutants, and they come out of chaotic, watery darkness. They are chaos creatures. Daniel sees the same throne room (v 9) that Ezekiel saw in his vision in Ezekiel 1. What Nebuchadnezzar had wanted, to be praised and worshiped by everyone, happens to the Son of Man when God exalts him.</p>\n<p>In parts three and four (29:30-52:00), Tim and Jon cover the interpretation of the dream in v15-27:<br />\nI, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. I approached one of those standing there and asked him the meaning of all this.<br />\nSo he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: \u2018The four great beasts are four kings that will rise from the earth. But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever\u2014yes, for ever and ever.\u2019<br />\nThen I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws\u2014the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell\u2014the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them, until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.<br />\nHe gave me this explanation: \u2018The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.<br />\n\u2018But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.'</p>\n<p>Tim makes the following observations: The \u201choly ones\u201d has a double meaning. It represents both the \u201choly\u201d sons of God/elohim, that is celestial beings in the divine council, and it represents a true human race who are \u201choly\u201d to God and fulfills their calling by following the true Son of Man.<br />\nDaniel 7 is a symbolic and cosmic depiction of a real, historical conflict (Antiochus\u2019 attack on Jerusalem and defilement of the temple in 167 B.C.), that is part of an ancient pattern going all the way back to Genesis 1-3.</p>\n<p>In part five (52:00-end), Tim observes that somewhere in Daniel 7 is a storyline that was crucial to Jesus and how he thought of his identity. So if someone wants to understand more about Jesus, they should invest the time to learn more about the Son of Man storyline in the Hebrew Scriptures.</p>\n<p>Thank you to of all our supporters!<br />\nHave a question for the upcoming Q+R?

He was a king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, a sort of resurgence of the previous Babylonian rule. Babylon had long been dormant while Assyria was the world superpower, but Babylon had a brief rise to prominence again under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar. He dominated Jerusalem and took their promising youth with him to Babylon. Daniel was in this group.</p>\n<p>Tim points out a few hyperlinks to other parts of the Hebrew Bible at the beginning of the book of Daniel. Daniel is the &quot;royal seed&quot; carried away to Babylon who replays the test of Adam and Eve and succeeds!</p>\n<p>Daniel 1:3-4: &quot;And the king of Babylon told his officers to bring from the sons of Israel and from the royal seed\u2026 youths...who were good of sight and wise with all wisdom, and knowing knowledge, and understanding knowledge\u2026&quot;<br />\nDan 1:5-7: &quot;And the king assigned for them a daily ration of the king\u2019s choice food and his wine, to raise them for three years so they could stand in his service. Among them were sons of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah...but Daniel set it upon his heart to not defile himself with the king\u2019s choice food or his wine\u2026&quot;<br />\nDan 1:12: &quot;Daniel said, 'Let there be given to us from the seeds, and we will eat, and water, and we will drink.'&quot;</p>\n<p>Daniel is depicted as a new Adam, who is brought into Babylon already having great knowledge. He refuses the forbidden food (Daniel ch. 1) and only increases in wisdom! Instead, he adopts an Eden-diet of veggies and water and is elevated to serve in the king\u2019s court.</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s point is that Daniel is the forbidden fruit that the king of Babylon has just taken. Daniel has an opportunity to eat the forbidden food of the king and break his kosher diet. He refuses the forbidden food and therefore passes the test.</p>\n<p>In part three (25:50-end), Tim and Jon go over the two dreams that Nebuchadnezzar has leading up to Daniel 7. In Daniel 2, the king has a dream. Once Daniel gives the interpretation, the king worships Daniel.</p>\n<p>Daniel 2:46-49:<br />\n&quot;Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped (sagid) Daniel, and gave orders to present to him an offering and incense.<br />\nThen the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.<br />\nAnd Daniel made request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon, while Daniel was at the king\u2019s court.&quot;</p>\n<p>Then Daniel 3 is an inversion of Daniel 2. The king wants everyone to worship an image of him. This is the story of the blazing furnace.</p>\n<p>Daniel 3:10-12:<br />\n\u201cYou, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe and all kinds of music, is to fall down and worship the image of gold.<br />\n\u201cBut whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire. \u201cThere are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. These men, O king, have disregarded you; they do not serve (palakh) your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Daniel 2 and 3 are inversions of each other, and then in Daniel 4, the king has another dream. In the dream, a &quot;watcher\u201d appears. Tim notes that this is the only time that specific word appears in the Hebrew Bible. However, it also appears in the book of Enoch, a Jewish book written in the same time period.</p>\n<p>The king calls Daniel again to interpret the dream.</p>\n<p>Daniel 4:20-25:<br />\n&quot;The tree that you saw, which became large and grew strong, whose height reached to the sky and was visible to all the earth and whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt and in whose branches the birds of the sky lodged\u2014 it is you, O king; for you have become great and grown strong, and your majesty has become great and reached to the sky and your dominion to the end of the earth. \u2018In that the king saw a watcher, a holy one, descending from heaven and saying, \u201cChop down the tree and destroy it; yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, but with a band of iron and bronze in the new grass of the field, and let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him share with the beasts of the field until seven periods of time pass over him,\u201d this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king: that you be driven away from mankind and your dwelling place be with the beasts of the field, and you be given grass to eat like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven; and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim notes that when the Babylons of this world acknowledge that God is truly the wise sovereign, then they can become the true human rulers they\u2019re intended to be. But when they do not, when they turn their national power and glory into an idol (as in Daniel chs. 2 and 3), God shows them what they are: beasts.</p>\n<p>The narrative contrasts the beastly Babylon with the human Daniel who submits to God\u2019s rule and is elevated to rule by God\u2019s wisdom.</p>\n<p>So to sum up the episode: The king of Babylon\u2019s worship of the divine image of Daniel in Daniel 2 is ironically reversed in Daniel 3, where his friends are forced to worship the false image of Babylon. These twin stories set up the tension of the book: What humanity will be exalted as the divinely appointed ruler of the world? Babylon or the \u201croyal seed\u201d represented by Daniel and his friends? The king\u2019s worship of Daniel becomes a narrative image of the worship of the son of man in Daniel 7. And Daniel 7 is a symbolic and cosmic depiction of a real, historical conflict (Antiochus\u2019 attack on Jerusalem and defilement of the temple in 167 B.C.) that has been depicted as part of an ancient pattern going all the way back to Genesis 1-3.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of our supporters!</p>\n<p>Show Produced By:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents<br />\nBloc, KV</p>\n<p>Show Resources:</p>\n<p>Our video on the Son of Man: https://bit.ly/2URk3BH</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>B.

Babylon or the \u201croyal seed\u201d represented by Daniel and his friends? The king\u2019s worship of Daniel becomes a narrative image of the worship of the son of man in Daniel 7. And Daniel 7 is a symbolic and cosmic depiction of a real, historical conflict (Antiochus\u2019 attack on Jerusalem and defilement of the temple in 167 B.C.) that has been depicted as part of an ancient pattern going all the way back to Genesis 1-3.\nThank you to all of our supporters!\nShow Produced By:\nShow Music:\nShow Resources:\nOur video on the Son of Man: https://bit.ly/2URk3BH\nB.

            "content": "<p>In part one (0:00-13:10), Tim recaps the series so far. He says the Son of Man title is Christ\u2019s favorite title to use to describe himself, and it originally comes from a dream in Daniel 7. Tim then recaps Genesis 1 and 2. Humans are created after the animals but are then called to rule over the animals. So the creation and power order is inverted. Humans are overcome by the animals when they listen to the serpent, and humans embrace an animal-like state. Tim emphasizes that flowing out of Genesis are two lineages: a human lineage, the seed of the woman, and an animal lineage, the seed of the serpent. And at some point, a Son of Man will deliver the seed of the woman from the seed of the serpent.</p>\n<p>In part two (13:10-18:30), Tim and Jon dive into the imagery of animals in the Bible. Jon asks what is the proper relationship with animals for people to have. Tim speculates that animals are meant to be in a peaceful relationship with humans. And a peaceful connection with the animals is an image the prophets use to describe a new creation. (Lions, lambs etc. )</p>\n<p>In part three (18:30-33:50), Tim dives further into Genesis. He examines the inverted first born/second born relationships in the book. Abraham has two children, Isaac and Ishmael. Ishmael is the firstborn but is not chosen by God. Instead, God chooses Isaac. Then later in the story, Isaac has two sons, Jacob and Esau. Jacob is the second born and is chosen by God. Tim points out that the pattern is intentional.</p>\n<p>In part four (33:50-end), Tim then moves into the account of the Exodus. Pharaoh says he wants to deal \u201cshrewdly\u201d with the Hebrews. This is a synonym of the snake saying it is the \u201ccrafty\u201d beast. Pharaoh is now embracing an animal-like tendency and seeking to harm the Hebrews.</p>\n<p>Then Tim dives into the story of the burning bush. God tells Moses to turn his staff into a snake ( snake (\u05e0\u05d7\u05e9) ). Many western readers see this story as some sort of magic trick that God is telling Moses to do. That's far from what's happening. Tim says the story is actually meant to portray Moses as a successful \u201cson of man\u201d who has power over the snake. This point is further emphasized when Moses and his brother Aaron go before Pharaoh to demand the release of the Hebrews. Aaron throws down his staff and it becomes, in Hebrew, a sea serpent. This is a different word than the previous word used for snake.</p>\n<p>Exodus 7:8-13:<br />\n&quot;Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, \u201cWhen Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, \u2018Perform a sign,\u2019 then you shall say to Aaron, \u2018Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a sea serpent (\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05df).\u2019&quot; So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and thus they did just as the Lord had commanded; and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a sea serpent (\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05df).<br />\nThen Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts. For each one threw down his staff and they turned into sea serpents (\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05df). But Aaron\u2019s staff swallowed up their staffs. Yet Pharaoh\u2019s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the Lord had said.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim says the point is Moses and Aaron becoming associated characters. They are humans who have power over the snake. Literally. They grab snakes and symbolically they prevail over Pharaoh. This theme is picked up by later biblical authors who see the symbolism and use the same word, \u201csea serpent,\u201d to describe Israel\u2019s enemies.</p>\n<p>Isaiah 51:9-11:<br />\n&quot;Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord; [// the arm of Moses with the staff]<br />\nAwake as in the days of old, the generations of long ago.<br />\nWas it not You who cut Rahab in pieces, [= Israelite name for the god of Egypt]<br />\nWho pierced the sea-monster (\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05df/tanin)<br />\nWas it not You who dried up the sea,<br />\nThe waters of the great deep;<br />\nWho made the depths of the sea a pathway<br />\nFor the redeemed to cross over?<br />\nSo the ransomed of the Lord will return<br />\nAnd come with joyful shouting to Zion&quot;</p>\n<p>Ezekiel 32:2:<br />\n\u201cSon of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him,<br />\n\u2018You compared yourself to a young lion of the nations,<br />\nYet you are like the monster (tanin) in the seas.&quot;</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of our supporters!</p>\n<p>Have a question about the Son of Man?

            "contentSnippet": "In part one (0:00-13:10), Tim recaps the series so far. He says the Son of Man title is Christ\u2019s favorite title to use to describe himself, and it originally comes from a dream in Daniel 7. Tim then recaps Genesis 1 and 2. Humans are created after the animals but are then called to rule over the animals. So the creation and power order is inverted. Humans are overcome by the animals when they listen to the serpent, and humans embrace an animal-like state. Tim emphasizes that flowing out of Genesis are two lineages: a human lineage, the seed of the woman, and an animal lineage, the seed of the serpent. And at some point, a Son of Man will deliver the seed of the woman from the seed of the serpent.\nIn part two (13:10-18:30), Tim and Jon dive into the imagery of animals in the Bible. Jon asks what is the proper relationship with animals for people to have. Tim speculates that animals are meant to be in a peaceful relationship with humans. And a peaceful connection with the animals is an image the prophets use to describe a new creation. (Lions, lambs etc. )\nIn part three (18:30-33:50), Tim dives further into Genesis. He examines the inverted first born/second born relationships in the book. Abraham has two children, Isaac and Ishmael. Ishmael is the firstborn but is not chosen by God. Instead, God chooses Isaac. Then later in the story, Isaac has two sons, Jacob and Esau. Jacob is the second born and is chosen by God. Tim points out that the pattern is intentional.\nIn part four (33:50-end), Tim then moves into the account of the Exodus. Pharaoh says he wants to deal \u201cshrewdly\u201d with the Hebrews. This is a synonym of the snake saying it is the \u201ccrafty\u201d beast. Pharaoh is now embracing an animal-like tendency and seeking to harm the Hebrews.\nThen Tim dives into the story of the burning bush. God tells Moses to turn his staff into a snake ( snake (\u05e0\u05d7\u05e9) ). Many western readers see this story as some sort of magic trick that God is telling Moses to do. That's far from what's happening. Tim says the story is actually meant to portray Moses as a successful \u201cson of man\u201d who has power over the snake. This point is further emphasized when Moses and his brother Aaron go before Pharaoh to demand the release of the Hebrews. Aaron throws down his staff and it becomes, in Hebrew, a sea serpent. This is a different word than the previous word used for snake.\nExodus 7:8-13:\nTim says the point is Moses and Aaron becoming associated characters. They are humans who have power over the snake. Literally. They grab snakes and symbolically they prevail over Pharaoh. This theme is picked up by later biblical authors who see the symbolism and use the same word, \u201csea serpent,\u201d to describe Israel\u2019s enemies.\nIsaiah 51:9-11:\nEzekiel 32:2:\nThank you to all of our supporters!\nHave a question about the Son of Man?

The snake is presented as crafty. This is the Hebrew word &quot;arum.\u201d In other cases in the Bible, this word has a positive connotation, but in this context, it means a negative use of intelligence. Gen 3:1:<br />\n&quot;Now the serpent was more arum than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.&quot;<br />\nIn the following Proverbs, arum is used to demonstrate a positive character trait.<br />\nProverbs 14:15: &quot;The naive believes everything, but the sensible man considers his steps.&quot;<br />\nProverbs 27:12: &quot;The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.&quot;</p>\n<p>So in Genesis 3, arum is translated as \u201ccrafty.\u201d This is the only time it's translated with a negative sense, but usually arum means sharp, quick thinker, problem solver etc.</p>\n<p>Tim also briefly says that in other ancient religions, especially in Egypt, snakes were symbolically significant. Tim says the snake is presented as a creature alongside the humans. It uses its divine blessing (wisdom) to twist the divine command by telling the humans that they can be like-God (or \u201clike gods\u201d). But the humans already are God-like, having been made in God\u2019s image.</p>\n<p>Tim observes that after Adam and Eve take the serpent's advice, eat the fruit, and are expelled from the Garden, the very next story is one where Cain also listens to \u201csin\u201d that is described as \u201ccrouching\u201d at his door. Both of these narratives portray humans being ruled by beasts, instead of ruling over them. Death is the result. Once humans choose to redefine good and evil, they become beastly.</p>\n<p>In part three (24:30-28:00), Tim quickly goes over the Messianic promise that God gives in Genesis 3:15:<br />\n\u201cAnd I will set hostility<br />\nBetween you [serpent] and the woman,<br />\nAnd between your [serpent] seed and her seed;<br />\nHe [seed of woman] shall strike you [serpent] on the head,<br />\nAnd you [serpent] shall strike him [seed of woman] on the heel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says that this sets up the main plot conflict for the biblical story. Humans must recover their ability to rule over the beasts, and this will be done by the true Son of Man who strikes the serpent.</p>\n<p>In part four (28:00-end), Tim overviews the whole biblical fall narrative. Tim says that the story of Noah is significant, as it represents a failed restart of creation. Noah was set up to save the animals from the flood. He did so, and seemed to act as a true son of man. Noah gets off the boat, and God recommissions Noah to \u201cbe fruitful and multiply\u201d and fill the earth. Then God pivots and gives humanity a new diet:<br />\n\u201cThe fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given.<br />\nEvery moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to you, as I gave the green plant.<br />\nOnly you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood&quot; (Genesis 9:1-4).</p>\n<p>Noah eventually falls away from following God\u2019s blessing. And one of his son\u2019s (Ham) descendants Nimrod is mentioned as being the first \u201chunter\u201d in the Bible. Nimrod was also the founder of Babylon. Why are we told both of these details about Nimrod\u2019s life? Because it represents an archetype that is developing. Humanity is now choosing to become part of a cycle of acting like beasts, creating a violent, killing culture.</p>\n<p>Since humanity has chosen this path, they now must be saved by the true Son of Man.

It uses its divine blessing (wisdom) to twist the divine command by telling the humans that they can be like-God (or \u201clike gods\u201d). But the humans already are God-like, having been made in God\u2019s image.\nTim observes that after Adam and Eve take the serpent's advice, eat the fruit, and are expelled from the Garden, the very next story is one where Cain also listens to \u201csin\u201d that is described as \u201ccrouching\u201d at his door. Both of these narratives portray humans being ruled by beasts, instead of ruling over them. Death is the result. Once humans choose to redefine good and evil, they become beastly.\nIn part three (24:30-28:00), Tim quickly goes over the Messianic promise that God gives in Genesis 3:15:\nTim says that this sets up the main plot conflict for the biblical story. Humans must recover their ability to rule over the beasts, and this will be done by the true Son of Man who strikes the serpent.\nIn part four (28:00-end), Tim overviews the whole biblical fall narrative. Tim says that the story of Noah is significant, as it represents a failed restart of creation. Noah was set up to save the animals from the flood. He did so, and seemed to act as a true son of man. Noah gets off the boat, and God recommissions Noah to \u201cbe fruitful and multiply\u201d and fill the earth. Then God pivots and gives humanity a new diet:\nNoah eventually falls away from following God\u2019s blessing. And one of his son\u2019s (Ham) descendants Nimrod is mentioned as being the first \u201chunter\u201d in the Bible. Nimrod was also the founder of Babylon. Why are we told both of these details about Nimrod\u2019s life? Because it represents an archetype that is developing. Humanity is now choosing to become part of a cycle of acting like beasts, creating a violent, killing culture.\nSince humanity has chosen this path, they now must be saved by the true Son of Man. He will be the seed of the woman, but instead of giving in to the violence of humanity, he will choose to overcome it.\nThank you to all of our supporters!\nShow Produced By:\nShow Music:\nShow Resources:\nOur video on the Son of Man: INSERT LINK\nGerhard von Rad, Genesis: A Commentary\nCrispin Fletcher-Louis, Jesus Monotheism\nRichard Bauckham, Living with Other Creatures\nJames Hamilton, With the Clouds of Heaven: The Book of Daniel in Biblical Theology\nBrandon Crowe, The Last Adam: A Theology of the Obedient Life of Jesus in the Gospels",

In this episode, Tim and Jon discuss humanity's role in relation to other parts of creation, specifically animals.</p>\n<p>In part one (0:00-30:15), the guys briefly recap the first episode and quickly go over Daniel\u2019s dream in Daniel 7, where he has a vision of the Son of Man appearing.</p>\n<p>Tim then dives into the language and ideas presented in Genesis 1 and specifically focuses on the order of creation and how the days are paired.<br />\nGenesis 1:1-2:<br />\nIn the beginning God created the skies and the land<br />\nand the land was wild and waste, and darkness was over the face of the watery deep, and the spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</p>\n<p>Wild (tohu) = unordered<br />\nWaste (vohu) = uninhabited<br />\nDay 1 - Light: Separated from dark, day and night.<br />\nDay 4 - Lights appointed to rule the day and night.<br />\nDay 2 - Waters above separated from waters below.<br />\nDay 5 - Creatures in waters below, creatures in waters above.<br />\n\u201cAnd God created the great sea monsters...&quot; (1:21)<br />\n\u201cAnd God blessed them, saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters\u2026\u201d (1:22)<br />\nDay 3 - Water separated from dry land.<br />\n\u201cLet the land bring forth (\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0) plants and vegetation and seed-producing plants and trees producing fruit.\u201d (1:12)<br />\nDay 6 - Creatures on the land.<br />\n\u201cLet the land bring forth (\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0) living beasts by their kinds.\u201d (1:25)</p>\n<p>\u201cLet us create the human (ha-adam) in our image and as our likeness\u2026<br />\nAnd God blessed them, and said, (1) be fruitful and multiply and fill the land and subdue it, and rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and the beasts on the land.\u201d (1:26-28)</p>\n<p>Gen 2:1-3: God rests on the seventh day, which does not end.</p>\n<p>Tim then focuses on humanity's relationship with animals. Tim notices that humans are the \u201csecond comers\u201d to creation, who are given the responsibility to rule over the animals who came first. This is a pattern that shows itself many times in Genesis. (Think about Joseph\u2019s sons later in the story.)</p>\n<p>Tim then asks what it means for humans to be called to rule over the animals. Tim cites Richard Bauckham\u2019s book Living with Other Creatures,</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is not often well enough noticed that the command God gives to humanity refers to two rather different matters. It refers first to the relationship of humans to the earth, secondly to their relationship to other living creatures...and they are not the same thing. Humans are not alone in being told to be fruitful and to multiply and to fill, the first and birds were given the same blessing on day 5. Only humans are told to fill and to subdue the land. In the narrative this refers clearly to agriculture, taking possession of the soil and working it in order to make it yield more food for humans than it would otherwise do.</p>\n<p>But what about all the other land animals? How does humanity\u2019s role of subduing land relate to God\u2019s blessing of the animals to fill the land? Notice God\u2019s next words to the humans:<br />\nSee, I have given you (humans) every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food. (Gen 1: 29\u2013 30)</p>\n<p>Why does God tell humans that he has given every plant for food for the other living creatures? Surely, the reason is that it is the humans who need to know that the produce of the earth is not intended to feed them alone, but also all the living species of the earth. The clear implication is that the earth can provide enough food for all creatures. Humans are not to fill the earth and subdue it in a way that leaves no room and no sustenance for the other creatures who share the earth with them. God has given them too the right to live from the soil. So the human right to make use of the earth, to live from it, is far from unlimited. It must respect the existence of other creatures.</p>\n<p>The biblical portrait of human dominion over the animals must be filled out by the Bible\u2019s vision of \u201croyal rule.\u201d Since Genesis depicts the image of God as a kind of royal function, the rule of a king over others, it is worth recalling the only passage in the law of Moses that refers to the role of the king in Israel (Deut. 17: 14\u2013 20). There it is emphasized that the king is one among his brothers and sisters, his fellow-Israelites, and should not forget it. He should not accumulate wealth or arms or indulge in any of the ways kings usually exalt themselves above their subjects. Only if they remember their fundamental solidarity with their people will kings be able to rule truly for the benefit of their people. Similarly, only when humans remember their fundamental solidarity with their fellow-creatures will they be able to exercise their distinctive authority within creation for the benefit of other creatures.\u201d (pp. 226-228)</p>\n<p>In part two (30:15-41:30), Jon asks about carnivorous animals like lions. Tim says that life survives at the expense of other lives right now, but apparently, in the new creation, that will fundamentally change.</p>\n<p>Tim says that humans bear responsibility for animal\u2019s destiny; that\u2019s why we are called to rule them. This is humanity acting in their identity of the divine image.</p>\n<p>Tim shares this quote:<br />\n\u201cThe close relation of the term for God\u2019s image with that for the commission to exercise dominion emerges quite clearly when we have understood selem as a plastic image. Just as powerful earthly kings, to indicate their claim to dominion, erect an image of themselves in the provinces of their empire where they do not personally appear, so man is placed upon earth in God\u2019s image as God\u2019s sovereign emblem. He is really only God\u2019s representative, summoned to maintain and enforce God\u2019s claim to dominion over the earth.\u201d<br />\nGerhard von Rad, Genesis: A Commentary, ed. Peter Ackroyd et al., trans. John H. Marks, Revised Edition., The Old Testament Library (Philadelphia, PA: The Westminster Press, 1972), 59\u201360.</p>\n<p>Tim says that a human making an idol is an oxymoron. Humans are the image of God, so why would they make one?</p>\n<p>Tim then posits that in Genesis 3, an animal (the snake) is the one who deceives Adam and Eve. Humans end up getting ruled by the animals instead of ruling them.</p>\n<p>In part three (41:30-53:00), the guys discuss Psalm 8:</p>\n<p>O Lord, our Lord,<br />\nHow majestic is Your name in all the earth,<br />\nWho have shown Your splendor above the heavens!<br />\n\u2026.When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,<br />\nThe moon and the stars, which You have ordained;<br />\nWhat is human that You take thought of him,<br />\nAnd the son of man (human) that You care for him?<br />\nYet You have made him a little lower than elohim (God or angelic beings),<br />\nAnd You crown him with glory and majesty! [kavod va-hadar \u2018divine attributes\u2019]<br />\nYou make him to rule [mashal] over the works of Your hands;<br />\nYou have put all things under his feet,<br />\nAll sheep and oxen,<br />\nAnd also the beasts of the field,<br />\nThe birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea,<br />\nWhatever passes through the paths of the seas.<br />\nO Lord, our Lord,<br />\nHow majestic is Your name in all the earth!<br />\nNotice how God\u2019s exaltation and glorification of humans is set within an inclusion frame about God\u2019s own majesty and reputation. An exalted humanity doesn\u2019t compete with God, rather it increases God\u2019s own honor, because humans are an expression of the divine beauty and creativity.</p>\n<p>In part four (53:00-end), Tim shares this quote:</p>\n<p>\u201cOne point of saying that God is the absolute sovereign (as the biblical texts say time and again) is to say that he is free: free to exalt and share his own power and divine power with those whom he wills, through a transformation of their nature and identity; free to create entities that in various ways share in his identity as ruler and judge, and who manifest his presence within the world\u2026 The God of the biblical story is able to enter into and take on the nature and identity of the very reality he has created, taking it up into his very self. God\u2019s identity is, apparently, \u201csharable.\u201d \u2026 God\u2019s identity is not a zero-sum game. To say that God shares his identity with humanity does not mean he suffers a loss of being; on the contrary, it is actually a way of saying that his identity is magnified and his glory extended.\u201d [Tim\u2019s note: \u201cand, we may add, this is the way the divine love is extended as well.\u201d] - Crispin Fletcher-Louis, Jesus Monotheism, 310-312.</p>\n<p>Tim says that for God, relationship with creation means entering into a shared relationship with it.</p>\n<p>Show Produced By:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents<br />\nThe Cave Resides Deep in the Forest, Artificial Music<br />\nTalking with You, Copyright free<br />\nVery Chill Saxaphone, Copyright free</p>\n<p>Show Resources:</p>\n<p>Gerhard von Rad, Genesis: A Commentary<br />\nCrispin Fletcher-Louis, Jesus Monotheism<br />\nRichard Bauckham, Living with Other Creatures.<br />\nOur video on the Son of Man: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6cWEcqxhlI&amp;t=113s</p>\n",

He is really only God\u2019s representative, summoned to maintain and enforce God\u2019s claim to dominion over the earth.\u201d<br />\nGerhard von Rad, Genesis: A Commentary, ed.

Marks, Revised Edition., The Old Testament Library (Philadelphia, PA: The Westminster Press, 1972), 59\u201360.</p>\n<p>Tim says that a human making an idol is an oxymoron. Humans are the image of God, so why would they make one?</p>\n<p>Tim then posits that in Genesis 3, an animal (the snake) is the one who deceives Adam and Eve. Humans end up getting ruled by the animals instead of ruling them.</p>\n<p>In part three (41:30-53:00), the guys discuss Psalm 8:</p>\n<p>O Lord, our Lord,<br />\nHow majestic is Your name in all the earth,<br />\nWho have shown Your splendor above the heavens!<br />\n\u2026.When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,<br />\nThe moon and the stars, which You have ordained;<br />\nWhat is human that You take thought of him,<br />\nAnd the son of man (human) that You care for him?<br />\nYet You have made him a little lower than elohim (God or angelic beings),<br />\nAnd You crown him with glory and majesty!

An exalted humanity doesn\u2019t compete with God, rather it increases God\u2019s own honor, because humans are an expression of the divine beauty and creativity.</p>\n<p>In part four (53:00-end), Tim shares this quote:</p>\n<p>\u201cOne point of saying that God is the absolute sovereign (as the biblical texts say time and again) is to say that he is free: free to exalt and share his own power and divine power with those whom he wills, through a transformation of their nature and identity; free to create entities that in various ways share in his identity as ruler and judge, and who manifest his presence within the world\u2026 The God of the biblical story is able to enter into and take on the nature and identity of the very reality he has created, taking it up into his very self. God\u2019s identity is, apparently, \u201csharable.\u201d \u2026 God\u2019s identity is not a zero-sum game. To say that God shares his identity with humanity does not mean he suffers a loss of being; on the contrary, it is actually a way of saying that his identity is magnified and his glory extended.\u201d [Tim\u2019s note: \u201cand, we may add, this is the way the divine love is extended as well.\u201d] - Crispin Fletcher-Louis, Jesus Monotheism, 310-312.</p>\n<p>Tim says that for God, relationship with creation means entering into a shared relationship with it.</p>\n<p>Show Produced By:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents<br />\nThe Cave Resides Deep in the Forest, Artificial Music<br />\nTalking with You, Copyright free<br />\nVery Chill Saxaphone, Copyright free</p>\n<p>Show Resources:</p>\n<p>Gerhard von Rad, Genesis: A Commentary<br />\nCrispin Fletcher-Louis, Jesus Monotheism<br />\nRichard Bauckham, Living with Other Creatures.<br />\nOur video on the Son of Man: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6cWEcqxhlI&amp;t=113s</p>\n",

In this episode, Tim and Jon discuss humanity's role in relation to other parts of creation, specifically animals.\nIn part one (0:00-30:15), the guys briefly recap the first episode and quickly go over Daniel\u2019s dream in Daniel 7, where he has a vision of the Son of Man appearing.\nTim then dives into the language and ideas presented in Genesis 1 and specifically focuses on the order of creation and how the days are paired.\nWild (tohu) = unordered\n\u201cLet us create the human (ha-adam) in our image and as our likeness\u2026\nGen 2:1-3: God rests on the seventh day, which does not end.\nTim then focuses on humanity's relationship with animals. Tim notices that humans are the \u201csecond comers\u201d to creation, who are given the responsibility to rule over the animals who came first. This is a pattern that shows itself many times in Genesis. (Think about Joseph\u2019s sons later in the story.)\nTim then asks what it means for humans to be called to rule over the animals. Tim cites Richard Bauckham\u2019s book Living with Other Creatures,\n\u201cIt is not often well enough noticed that the command God gives to humanity refers to two rather different matters. It refers first to the relationship of humans to the earth, secondly to their relationship to other living creatures...and they are not the same thing. Humans are not alone in being told to be fruitful and to multiply and to fill, the first and birds were given the same blessing on day 5. Only humans are told to fill and to subdue the land. In the narrative this refers clearly to agriculture, taking possession of the soil and working it in order to make it yield more food for humans than it would otherwise do.\nBut what about all the other land animals? How does humanity\u2019s role of subduing land relate to God\u2019s blessing of the animals to fill the land? Notice God\u2019s next words to the humans:\nWhy does God tell humans that he has given every plant for food for the other living creatures? Surely, the reason is that it is the humans who need to know that the produce of the earth is not intended to feed them alone, but also all the living species of the earth. The clear implication is that the earth can provide enough food for all creatures. Humans are not to fill the earth and subdue it in a way that leaves no room and no sustenance for the other creatures who share the earth with them. God has given them too the right to live from the soil. So the human right to make use of the earth, to live from it, is far from unlimited. It must respect the existence of other creatures.\nThe biblical portrait of human dominion over the animals must be filled out by the Bible\u2019s vision of \u201croyal rule.\u201d Since Genesis depicts the image of God as a kind of royal function, the rule of a king over others, it is worth recalling the only passage in the law of Moses that refers to the role of the king in Israel (Deut. 17: 14\u2013 20). There it is emphasized that the king is one among his brothers and sisters, his fellow-Israelites, and should not forget it. He should not accumulate wealth or arms or indulge in any of the ways kings usually exalt themselves above their subjects. Only if they remember their fundamental solidarity with their people will kings be able to rule truly for the benefit of their people. Similarly, only when humans remember their fundamental solidarity with their fellow-creatures will they be able to exercise their distinctive authority within creation for the benefit of other creatures.\u201d (pp. 226-228)\nIn part two (30:15-41:30), Jon asks about carnivorous animals like lions. Tim says that life survives at the expense of other lives right now, but apparently, in the new creation, that will fundamentally change.\nTim says that humans bear responsibility for animal\u2019s destiny; that\u2019s why we are called to rule them.

            "content": "<p>In part one (0:00-19:30), the guys discuss what \u201cson of\u201d means in our current culture. They bring up certain phrases like \u201cSons of Anarchy,\u201d \u201cSons of Liberty,\u201d etc. Tim says this means that someone identifies with an idea or ideology.</p>\n<p>Tim then offers the fact that historically people have referred to Jesus as Christ. Christ is actually a Greek word meaning Messiah. Messiah in Hebrew means the anointed one.</p>\n<p>Tim then says that Jesus never referred to himself as Christ or Messiah, and when others would refer to him as this, he would reply that he is the \u201cSon of Man.\u201d Why is this?</p>\n<p>For example in Luke 9:18-22:<br />\n&quot;Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, 'Who do the crowds say I am?' They replied, 'Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.' 'But what about you?' he asked. 'Who do you say I am?' Peter answered, 'God\u2019s Messiah.' Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. And he said, 'The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.'&quot;</p>\n<p>Jesus refers to himself as the Son of Man in the third person immediately after Peter called him the Messiah.</p>\n<p>Tim then posits that Paul doesn\u2019t use the phrase \u201cthe Son of Man\u201d in his writings. Instead, he uses phrases like \u201cthe firstborn of all creation\u201d or \u201cthe new humanity.\u201d Tim says this is because Paul is taking the message of Jesus to an international audience that isn\u2019t familiar with what the Son of Man means.</p>\n<p>So what does the Son of Man mean? And where does it come from?</p>\n<p>Well in part two (19:30-32:00), Tim takes us to Daniel 7, a famous dream that Daniel had where the Son of Man appears. Tim says that this dream is very iconic and well known in Jewish history. Everyone would have known about it.</p>\n<p>Daniel has a dream about a succession of beasts that trample humanity.

At any point in time, we are never aware of a full identity of something or someone because our knowledge of that thing is always partial.</p>\n<p>Tim says that God\u2019s identity as a community of love represented in the Trinity is mirrored when humans choose to live in a community of love as well.<br />\nTim cites Michael Reeves and asks what God was doing before Creation? Tim says the Apostles offer an answer to this question with John 17:24 and Jesus claiming \u201cyou loved me before the creation of the world.\u201d So the eternal state of God is as Father loving the Son through the Spirit. What does it mean that God is a \u201cloving father?\u201d<br />\nWell, Yahweh is occasionally described as Father in the OT (Exod 4:22; Hosea 11:1; Isaiah 63:16), and Jesus used &quot;my father&quot; as his fundamental title for God.</p>\n<p>In part two (31:00-42:15), the guys continue to break down the doctrine of the Trinity. Tim expands on the identity of God as a father and shares a quote from Reeves addressing why Jesus used the word father to describe his relationship.<br />\n\u201cJesus called God \u2018Father\u2019 because he is a father. It\u2019s a name rich with meaning. A father is someone who gives life, who \u2018begets\u2019 children\u2026 If, before all things, God was eternally a father, that means \u201cGod\u201d is an inherently outgoing, others-centered, life-giving God. The Christian God did not give life for the first time when he decided to create the universe. We\u2019re asked to consider that from eternity God in his essence is life-giving\u2026 This is why in 1 John 4, he says \u201cGod is love,\u201d because in the next sentence he says \u201cThis is how God revealed his love among us: he sent his One and Only Son, that we might live through him.\u201d The God who is love is the Father who sends the Son. To be Father means to love, to give out life, to the Son and through him to others.\u201d \u2013 Michael Reeves, Delighting in the Trinity, 24.</p>\n<p>Jon says that things get very metaphorical very quickly because God\u2019s relationship with Jesus is not a one-created-the-other relationship. Instead, their relationship is a symbiotic one. They give and receive love as a father and son should give and receive love.</p>\n<p>Tim goes further and points out that biblical writers say that God is not only father but also love. The guys both agree that when discussing this, you quickly find yourself at the limits of language. There is an inability to articulate the identity of God, and that is the point.<br />\nTim also shares Gregory of Nyssa's commentary on Hebrews 1:3: \u201cThe Son is the radiance of God\u2019s glory and the exact representation of God\u2019s being. As the light from the lamp is of the same nature as the flame which shed the brightness and is united with it [where does the light \u201cbegin\u201d?], so the Son is of the Father and the Father is never without the Son; for it is impossible that glory should be without radiance, as it is impossible that the lamp should be without brightness.\u201d \u2013 \u201cOn the Faith,\u201d in Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 2.5, p.338</p>\n<p>In part three (42:15-end), Tim shares the Baptism of Jesus as seen when looking for the Trinity. The Father loves the Son through/by the Spirit. Tim cites Reeves again:<br />\n\u201cThe way the Father, Son, and Spirit, related at Jesus\u2019 baptism was not a one-time only event. The whole scene is full of echoes of Genesis 1. There at creation, the Spirit also hovered, dovelike, over the waters. And just as the Spirit, after Jesus\u2019 baptism, would send him out into the lifeless wilderness, so in Genesis 1 the Spirit appears as the power by which God\u2019s word goes out into the lifeless void\u2026 In both the work of creation (Genesis 1) and in the work of new creation (the Gospel stories), God\u2019s word goes out by his Spirit. It\u2019s all revealing what God is truly like. The Spirit is the One through whom the Father loves, blesses, and empowers his Son. The Son goes out from the Father by the Spirit.\u201d \u2013 Michael Reeves, Delighting in the Trinity, 30.</p>\n<p>Tim then shares 2 Corinthians 13:14: \u201cThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship [Grk. koinonia] of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jon says that the word \u201cGod\u201d becomes a stand-in for Father. Tim says that\u2019s correct and can be confusing at times, but it should be examined contextually to see what it\u2019s referring to. Tim then shares Galatians 4:4: \u201cBecause you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, \u201cAbba! Father!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim closes the episode by sharing a final quote from Reeves:<br />\n\u201cThis \u2018God\u2019 simply doesn\u2019t fit the mold of any other. The Trinity is not some inessential add-on to God, some optional software that can be plugged into him. At bottom, in essence, this God is not first of all Creator or Ruler or even \u201cDeity\u201d in some abstract sense. He is Father, loving his Son in the fellowship of the Spirit. A God who is in himself a community of love, who before all things could never be anything but love.

Today Tim and Jon discuss the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.\nIn part one (0:00-31:00), Tim and Jon briefly discuss how identity is always contingent upon things revealed by that individual. At any point in time, we are never aware of a full identity of something or someone because our knowledge of that thing is always partial.\nTim says that God\u2019s identity as a community of love represented in the Trinity is mirrored when humans choose to live in a community of love as well.\nIn part two (31:00-42:15), the guys continue to break down the doctrine of the Trinity. Tim expands on the identity of God as a father and shares a quote from Reeves addressing why Jesus used the word father to describe his relationship.\nJon says that things get very metaphorical very quickly because God\u2019s relationship with Jesus is not a one-created-the-other relationship.

Today Tim and Jon dive into the Gospel of John and how it portrays the relationship between God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.</p>\n<p>In part one (0:00-13:30), Tim says that reading John is similar to watching a remake of a movie, only with a different director. The Gospel of John was the Gospel that was written the latest, and John himself seems to have been the last living disciple of the original twelve. Tim says that John feels like a reflective retelling of the story of Jesus. This means the language used in the book is slightly different than in other Gospels and books in the Bible.</p>\n<p>Tim says that John specifically hones in on using the language of \u201coneness.\u201d It echoes the Shema. For example, Tim cites Richard Baukum, saying that in John 5:16 (Healing the crippled man on the Sabbath):<br />\n\u201cFor this reason, the Jews were persecuting Jesus because He was doing these things on the Sabbath. But He answered them, \u201cMy Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.\u201d For this reason, therefore, the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.&quot;</p>\n<p>Or again in John 10:30-31: \u201c'I and the Father are one.' The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him.\u201d</p>\n<p>And again in John 14:10: \u201cPhilip, do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says that the point is that John has reflected the Jewish Shema in Jesus and God the Father\u2019s relationship intentionally.</p>\n<p>In part two (13:30-23:30), Tim and John look at the divine name.<br />\nJohn 8:56-59&quot; \u201cYour father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.\u201d So the Jews said to Him, 'You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?' Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.' Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him.\u201d Tim says that this is taken directly from Exodus 3:14.</p>\n<p>In part three (23:30-28:10), the guys look at John 17. Tim calls this chapter the climatic summary of the themes in the book.<br />\nJohn 17:1-3: \u201cFather, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, that the Son may glorify You, even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that to all whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life. This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.&quot;<br />\nTim says to notice the Daniel 7 echoes: Son, authority over all flesh, etc.</p>\n<p>John 17:5: \u201cNow, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.\u201d Tim says that Jesus was the pre-existent word and wisdom of God and the embodiment of his divine glory.</p>\n<p>In part four (28:10-end), Tim shares John 17:11. &quot;Holy Father, keep them in your name, the name which you have given me, that they may be one even as we are one.\u201d Tim says that Jesus and the Father bear \u201cthe name\u201d showing that they are one.</p>\n<p>John 17:20-26: \u201cI do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that also they may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me. The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as we are one; I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in one-ness, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have loved Me. Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, although the world has not known You, yet I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me; and I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says that the true nature of God the Father\u2019s relationship with Jesus is mirrored in how people relate with each other through love.</p>\n<p>Tim shares a quote from scholar Larry Hurtado: \u201cThe Gospel of John draws on a rich, almost interchangeable association of God and God\u2019s name to express a uniquely intimate relationship between Jesus and the Father. Indeed, for the author of the Gospel of John, for whom the biblical traditions provided the authoritative store of vocabulary, images, and themes by which to express the significance of Jesus, this divine-name tradition constituted the most profound way to portray the relationship of the \u201cson\u201d to the \u201cfather.\u201d To speak of Jesus as invested with the divine name, as given the name, as manifesting God\u2019s name in his own words and actions, as coming with and in the name of God, was to portray Jesus as bearing and exhibiting God in the most direct way possible in the conceptual categories of the biblical tradition and within the monotheistic commitment of that tradition. In the centuries following the Gospel of John, Christians began using terms and conceptual categories from Greek philosophical traditions (words like: being, essence, person). But it\u2019s important to see that the use of the divine-name tradition in John is on it own terms an equally radical and direct claim about the relationship between Jesus and God.\u201d -- Larry Hurtado, The Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Early Christianity.</p>\n<p>Jon comments that the Gospel of John seems to be the most Jewish of all the Gospels. Tim says he agrees. John speaks directly to all of the Old Testament Jewish \u201cshelves\u201d of who God is. All these shelves are difficult for many modern people to fully understand without learning how an ancient Jew would have thought and acted. Jon says there are not only other languages to deal with when reading the Bible (Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic, English etc) but also foreign ways of thinking.

Tim calls this chapter the climatic summary of the themes in the book.\nJohn 17:5: \u201cNow, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.\u201d Tim says that Jesus was the pre-existent word and wisdom of God and the embodiment of his divine glory.\nIn part four (28:10-end), Tim shares John 17:11. \"Holy Father, keep them in your name, the name which you have given me, that they may be one even as we are one.\u201d Tim says that Jesus and the Father bear \u201cthe name\u201d showing that they are one.\nJohn 17:20-26: \u201cI do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that also they may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me. The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as we are one; I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in one-ness, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have loved Me. Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, although the world has not known You, yet I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me; and I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.\u201d\nTim says that the true nature of God the Father\u2019s relationship with Jesus is mirrored in how people relate with each other through love.\nTim shares a quote from scholar Larry Hurtado: \u201cThe Gospel of John draws on a rich, almost interchangeable association of God and God\u2019s name to express a uniquely intimate relationship between Jesus and the Father. Indeed, for the author of the Gospel of John, for whom the biblical traditions provided the authoritative store of vocabulary, images, and themes by which to express the significance of Jesus, this divine-name tradition constituted the most profound way to portray the relationship of the \u201cson\u201d to the \u201cfather.\u201d To speak of Jesus as invested with the divine name, as given the name, as manifesting God\u2019s name in his own words and actions, as coming with and in the name of God, was to portray Jesus as bearing and exhibiting God in the most direct way possible in the conceptual categories of the biblical tradition and within the monotheistic commitment of that tradition. In the centuries following the Gospel of John, Christians began using terms and conceptual categories from Greek philosophical traditions (words like: being, essence, person). But it\u2019s important to see that the use of the divine-name tradition in John is on it own terms an equally radical and direct claim about the relationship between Jesus and God.\u201d -- Larry Hurtado, The Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Early Christianity.\nJon comments that the Gospel of John seems to be the most Jewish of all the Gospels. Tim says he agrees. John speaks directly to all of the Old Testament Jewish \u201cshelves\u201d of who God is. All these shelves are difficult for many modern people to fully understand without learning how an ancient Jew would have thought and acted.

Today Tim and Jon dive into the Gospel of John and how it portrays the relationship between God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.\nIn part one (0:00-13:30), Tim says that reading John is similar to watching a remake of a movie, only with a different director.

The passages that Tim shares are commonly referred to as the \u201cTrinitarian texts\u201d of Paul. These passages were fundamental to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.</p>\n<p>In part 1(0-11:00), Tim uses an example out of Galatians 4.<br />\n\u201cBut when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Torah, so that He might redeem those who were under the Torah, that we might receive the adoption as sons. Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, \u201cAbba! Father!\u201d</p>\n<p>Here, Paul invites people to see that the same Father-Son love that was communicated by the Spirit at Jesus\u2019 baptism is inviting us into the community of divine love as well. Tim says you quickly reach the point in Paul\u2019s letters where all the terms are interchangeable. Jesus\u2019 Father becomes \u201cOur Father\u201d.</p>\n<p>In part 2(11:00-21:50), Tim shares another example, this time out of<br />\nJesus, the Spirit, and God\u2019s Life [Romans 8:9-11]<br />\nHowever, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you. [Romans 8:14-15] For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, \u201cAbba! Father!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim points out that this statement is very similar to the Shema. Paul has taken the God/Spirit unity and put Christ in the middle of it. Paul and the early Christians believed that Jesus was divine from the very beginning. Christ\u2019s divinity, identity as God, and the doctrine of the Trinity, are beliefs that the earliest Christians shared, it was not an idea later imposed on Christianity.</p>\n<p>In Part 3 (21:50-end),<br />\nTim outlines part of his own personal journey of faith. He shares that when Paul says we are known by God more than we actually know God. Fundamentally, Christianity is experiencing God, living in a relationship with God.

            "content": "<p>This episode continues our series on God as a character in the Bible. Today Tim and Jon dive into the writings of Paul in the New Testament.</p>\n<p>In part one (0:00-7:25), Tim explains that Paul\u2019s writings are actually chronologically written earlier than the Gospels, even though they come toward the end of our modern Bibles. Tim says this is important because it shows that the theology expressed by Paul wasn\u2019t something that developed years later after the Gospels. Instead, Paul\u2019s stance on Jesus actually predates the accounts.</p>\n<p>In part two (7:25-22:10), Tim and Jon examine Romans 10:8-9, 12-13: \u201cThe message concerning faith that we proclaim: If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved\u2026. For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile\u2014the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, 'Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s point is that the Greek word \u201ckurios,\u201d when translated through the Hebrew, equates to Paul calling Jesus Yahweh. So in the quote from the book of Joel, the logic would be: Jesus = Kurios = Yahweh.</p>\n<p>Joel 2:32: Hebrew: \u201cEveryone who calls on the name of Yahweh will be saved.\u201d</p>\n<p>Joel 2:32 Greek Septuagint: \u201cEveryone who calls on the name of Kurios will be saved.\u201d \u201cJesus is Lurios\u201d</p>\n<p>Romans 10:9, 13: \u201cEveryone who calls on the name of Kurios will be saved.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim moves on and talks about Jesus and the Shema in 1 Corinthians 8:4. \u201cTherefore concerning the eating of foods sacrificed to idols, we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the world and that there is no God but one. For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords, yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we exist through Him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says that Paul has basically inserted Jesus into the Shema.</p>\n<p>The Messianic Shema in 1 Corinthians 8:6:<br />\nFor us, there is one God (theos),<br />\nthe Father,<br />\nfrom whom are all things<br />\nand we exist for Him;<br />\nand one Lord (kurios),<br />\nJesus Christ,<br />\nby whom are all things,<br />\nand we exist through Him.</p>\n<p>The Shema in Deuteronomy 6:4-5:<br />\nHebrew: \u201cListen O Israel, Yahweh is our Elohim, Yahweh is one.<br />\nGreek Septuagint: \u201cHear O Israel, Kurios is our theos, Kurios is one.<br />\n\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd</p>\n<p>Tim says the analogy of 1+1=1 is a mathematical analogy to show how Paul reasons that Jesus and God the Father can be one and separate at the same time. With this logic, he can fit both Jesus and God the Father in the Shema comfortably.</p>\n<p>In part three (22:10-end), Tim outlines Colossians 1:15-20:</p>\n<p>And He is the image of the invisible God,<br />\nthe firstborn of all creation.<br />\nFor by Him all things were created,<br />\n[both] in the heavens and on earth,<br />\nvisible and invisible,<br />\nwhether thrones or dominions<br />\nor rulers or authorities\u2014<br />\nall things have been created through Him and to himself.<br />\nAnd He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.</p>\n<p>And He is head of the body, the church;<br />\nand He is the beginning,<br />\nthe firstborn from the dead ones;<br />\nso that he might have first place in everything.<br />\nFor in him it was the [Father's] good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell<br />\nand through Him to reconcile all things to Himself,<br />\nhaving made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him,<br />\nwhether things on earth or things in heaven.</p>\n<p>Tim points out that this is a sort of summit of Paul\u2019s ideas on Jesus.

            "content": "<p>This is our fourth Q+R related to our series outlining the character of God in the Bible. Tim and Jon responded to seven questions related to Jesus and His part in the divine identity in the Bible.</p>\n<p>Here are the questions and timestamps:</p>\n<p>Q1: (1:00)<br />\nEvan from Suwanee, Georgia:<br />\nYou've talked about the wisdom, glory, word, and spirit of God and how biblical authors treat them as Yahweh but also distinct from Yahweh. Similarly, the angel of Yahweh is also written about in the same way. Trinitarians suggest God is three persons in one essence yet we see these four additional attributes and the angel of Yahweh treated in a similar manner. So my question is, how did the biblical authors treat the Father, Son, and Spirit differently that would lead to the Trinitarian viewpoint vs. a multi-faceted God who is more than just a triune Godhead? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Q2: (11:25)</p>\n<p>Lindsay from Breman, Indiana:<br />\nI was wondering, you guys just spoke a little bit about how in the Gospel of John we see all of those threads coming together, such as God's wisdom, glory, and the word of God as distinct from Yahweh but Yahweh. Is there anything like that in the synoptic gospels? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Q3: (28:55)<br />\nChris from Orange County, California:<br />\nIf the idea of the Trinity is based on commonly held views by the Hebrews of a complex God then why were the Jews in Luke 22 and John 10 so incensed by Jesus' claim to be the son of God and why is that a common objection by Jews today?</p>\n<p>Q4: (33:10)<br />\nAndrew from Gresham, Oregon:<br />\nI have a question regarding Jesus as God. At the beginning of the Gospel of John, I've heard Jehovah's Witnesses say the church has always misunderstood that reference to the Word being God and it truly is saying that the Word was a god. With all the talk we've had about the various Elohim I'm wondering if there's some credence to that or if it really was saying that the Word was God proper. Thanks, guys!</p>\n<p>Q5: (36:55)<br />\nBrandon from Provo, Utah:<br />\nIn previous podcasts, you talked about how personified wisdom and Jesus Himself are tied to Yahweh's transcendent nature by means of creation and exaltation imagery. What does it mean for Jesus to grant &quot;the one that conquers&quot; in Revelation 3 to sit with Jesus on His throne just like He conquered and sits with His Father on His throne? Is this part of what Jesus was praying for in John 17? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Q6: (43:10)<br />\nJoel from South Carolina:<br />\nWhile you guys were discussing the different attributes of God, it reminded me of how love is often described in the New Testament, specifically in 1 John 4:7-8. In verse 7 it says love is &quot;from God&quot; while in verse 8 it says God is love. So I was wondering whether love is considered to be a part of these attributes that are separate from God while at the same time being a part of God. Thank you!</p>\n<p>Q7: (46:45)<br />\nMichael from Bangkok, Thailand:<br />\nMy question is about the identity for of mission of Jesus. When I was younger, I assumed that because Jesus was God He was aware of that His whole life. But when I see things like Jesus asking questions as a boy in the temple or Luke saying Jesus grew in wisdom it seems to me Jesus didn't start out with this inherent self-awareness of being God but went through a process learning about God and even His own identity as Messiah through the Scriptures and the Holy Spirit. So what does the Bible show us about Jesus' process of understanding His own identity?

Trinitarians suggest God is three persons in one essence yet we see these four additional attributes and the angel of Yahweh treated in a similar manner. So my question is, how did the biblical authors treat the Father, Son, and Spirit differently that would lead to the Trinitarian viewpoint vs. a multi-faceted God who is more than just a triune Godhead? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Q2: (11:25)</p>\n<p>Lindsay from Breman, Indiana:<br />\nI was wondering, you guys just spoke a little bit about how in the Gospel of John we see all of those threads coming together, such as God's wisdom, glory, and the word of God as distinct from Yahweh but Yahweh. Is there anything like that in the synoptic gospels? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Q3: (28:55)<br />\nChris from Orange County, California:<br />\nIf the idea of the Trinity is based on commonly held views by the Hebrews of a complex God then why were the Jews in Luke 22 and John 10 so incensed by Jesus' claim to be the son of God and why is that a common objection by Jews today?</p>\n<p>Q4: (33:10)<br />\nAndrew from Gresham, Oregon:<br />\nI have a question regarding Jesus as God. At the beginning of the Gospel of John, I've heard Jehovah's Witnesses say the church has always misunderstood that reference to the Word being God and it truly is saying that the Word was a god. With all the talk we've had about the various Elohim I'm wondering if there's some credence to that or if it really was saying that the Word was God proper. Thanks, guys!</p>\n<p>Q5: (36:55)<br />\nBrandon from Provo, Utah:<br />\nIn previous podcasts, you talked about how personified wisdom and Jesus Himself are tied to Yahweh's transcendent nature by means of creation and exaltation imagery. What does it mean for Jesus to grant &quot;the one that conquers&quot; in Revelation 3 to sit with Jesus on His throne just like He conquered and sits with His Father on His throne? Is this part of what Jesus was praying for in John 17? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Q6: (43:10)<br />\nJoel from South Carolina:<br />\nWhile you guys were discussing the different attributes of God, it reminded me of how love is often described in the New Testament, specifically in 1 John 4:7-8. In verse 7 it says love is &quot;from God&quot; while in verse 8 it says God is love. So I was wondering whether love is considered to be a part of these attributes that are separate from God while at the same time being a part of God. Thank you!</p>\n<p>Q7: (46:45)<br />\nMichael from Bangkok, Thailand:<br />\nMy question is about the identity for of mission of Jesus. When I was younger, I assumed that because Jesus was God He was aware of that His whole life. But when I see things like Jesus asking questions as a boy in the temple or Luke saying Jesus grew in wisdom it seems to me Jesus didn't start out with this inherent self-awareness of being God but went through a process learning about God and even His own identity as Messiah through the Scriptures and the Holy Spirit. So what does the Bible show us about Jesus' process of understanding His own identity?

They ask the big question: Just who did Jesus think he was?</p>\n<p>In part one (00:00-12:15), Tim and Jon briefly recap the conversation so far. As depicted in the Hebrew Scriptures, God is a \u201ccomplex unity.\u201d Tim says it\u2019s a fundamental mistake and a case of cultural imperialism to read the Bible expecting the biblical authors to use language and words the same way that you do. He offers an example: Would you travel to another country and expect them to speak the same way, eat the same things, and have all of the cultural norms you are accustomed to? Of course not. You travel to see other cultures. So when reading the Bible, the reader needs to be trained to think as a Hebrew author would think.</p>\n<p>In part two (12:15 - 24:15), Tim breaks down some of Jesus' more inflammatory claims, including that \u201call the things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son reveals him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says that when Jesus says this it's another way of Jesus proclaiming he is the Son of Man, but he doesn\u2019t use Daniel 7 Son of Man language. Instead, he uses Father/Son language. Jesus is saying that just because people may not recognize who he is, doesn\u2019t change his identity as the Son of Man. Tim says there was a point in Jesus' human development where he became aware of his identity as the Messiah. The only window into this is the short story in Luke where Jesus is twelve years old and wants to stay in the temple because he\u2019s aware of his identity.</p>\n<p>In part three (24:15- 40:40), Jon asks how ancient Jews thought of the Son of Man coming? Tim says that the Son of Man figure in Daniel 7 inspired a lot of different ideas. Jesus is claiming that he is opening up a way to relate to the God of Israel as \u201cFather.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim outlines Matthew 26. The high priest demands to know if Jesus is the Messiah. Tim makes a key distinction. For the Jews, the title Son of Man is much more blasphemous than the title Son of God. To be a Son of God is a royal title that says you\u2019re a descendant of King David. To be the Son of Man means you are claiming divinity, sharing in God\u2019s own identity.</p>\n<p>Jesus\u2019 response to the high priest is a response from Psalm 110 and Daniel 7. He says \u201cfrom this moment,\u201d meaning that as soon as he is condemned to death, it is actually the beginning of his installment or coronation as the Son of Man, who will now be sitting at the \u201cright hand of the Father.\u201d Jesus is then given a robe and a crown of thorns and is crucified. This is his coronation as King of the universe.</p>\n<p>In part four (40:40 -44:35), Tim gives a historical example of \u201cAlexamenos of Rome,\u201d an ancient piece of Roman graffiti depicting Christ being crucified, only in the image he has the head of a donkey. The graffiti is the Romans mocking someone named Alexamenos for worshiping Jesus, saying that it\u2019s completely absurd.</p>\n<p>Tim offers an example of twenty-one Christians in the Middle East who were slaughtered and beheaded for their faith in Jesus. The apostles would have you believe that while they were being brutally murdered, they were the ones in charge, not their captors. How counterintuitive.</p>\n<p>In part five (44:35-end), Tim and Jon briefly discuss Christian baptism. Baptisms bookend the book of Matthew. At the beginning, Jesus is baptized, and at the end, he tells his disciples to baptize new believers. Tim says that, unfortunately, baptism has been controversial and divisive in Christian history. Because the apostles didn't seem to be interested in explaining baptism to the degree that it would solve debates about what baptism actually means and symbolizes. Tim says that regardless, all Christians agree that it is an important motif in Christianity. Why? Because you get to identify yourself with the Jesus story, going through the same ritual he did to identify as a child of God.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of our supporters!</p>\n<p>Have a question?

He says \u201cfrom this moment,\u201d meaning that as soon as he is condemned to death, it is actually the beginning of his installment or coronation as the Son of Man, who will now be sitting at the \u201cright hand of the Father.\u201d Jesus is then given a robe and a crown of thorns and is crucified. This is his coronation as King of the universe.\nIn part four (40:40 -44:35), Tim gives a historical example of \u201cAlexamenos of Rome,\u201d an ancient piece of Roman graffiti depicting Christ being crucified, only in the image he has the head of a donkey. The graffiti is the Romans mocking someone named Alexamenos for worshiping Jesus, saying that it\u2019s completely absurd.\nTim offers an example of twenty-one Christians in the Middle East who were slaughtered and beheaded for their faith in Jesus. The apostles would have you believe that while they were being brutally murdered, they were the ones in charge, not their captors. How counterintuitive.\nIn part five (44:35-end), Tim and Jon briefly discuss Christian baptism. Baptisms bookend the book of Matthew. At the beginning, Jesus is baptized, and at the end, he tells his disciples to baptize new believers. Tim says that, unfortunately, baptism has been controversial and divisive in Christian history. Because the apostles didn't seem to be interested in explaining baptism to the degree that it would solve debates about what baptism actually means and symbolizes. Tim says that regardless, all Christians agree that it is an important motif in Christianity. Why? Because you get to identify yourself with the Jesus story, going through the same ritual he did to identify as a child of God.\nThank you to all of our supporters!\nHave a question?

Please keep the audio file to about 20 seconds and let us know your name and where you\u2019re from.\nThis episode continues our series on God. Tim and Jon dive deeper into the portrayal of Jesus as a character in the New Testament. They ask the big question: Just who did Jesus think he was?\nIn part one (00:00-12:15), Tim and Jon briefly recap the conversation so far. As depicted in the Hebrew Scriptures, God is a \u201ccomplex unity.\u201d Tim says it\u2019s a fundamental mistake and a case of cultural imperialism to read the Bible expecting the biblical authors to use language and words the same way that you do. He offers an example: Would you travel to another country and expect them to speak the same way, eat the same things, and have all of the cultural norms you are accustomed to? Of course not. You travel to see other cultures. So when reading the Bible, the reader needs to be trained to think as a Hebrew author would think.\nIn part two (12:15 - 24:15), Tim breaks down some of Jesus' more inflammatory claims, including that \u201call the things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son reveals him.\u201d\nTim says that when Jesus says this it's another way of Jesus proclaiming he is the Son of Man, but he doesn\u2019t use Daniel 7 Son of Man language. Instead, he uses Father/Son language. Jesus is saying that just because people may not recognize who he is, doesn\u2019t change his identity as the Son of Man. Tim says there was a point in Jesus' human development where he became aware of his identity as the Messiah. The only window into this is the short story in Luke where Jesus is twelve years old and wants to stay in the temple because he\u2019s aware of his identity.\nIn part three (24:15- 40:40), Jon asks how ancient Jews thought of the Son of Man coming? Tim says that the Son of Man figure in Daniel 7 inspired a lot of different ideas. Jesus is claiming that he is opening up a way to relate to the God of Israel as \u201cFather.\u201d\nTim outlines Matthew 26. The high priest demands to know if Jesus is the Messiah. Tim makes a key distinction. For the Jews, the title Son of Man is much more blasphemous than the title Son of God. To be a Son of God is a royal title that says you\u2019re a descendant of King David. To be the Son of Man means you are claiming divinity, sharing in God\u2019s own identity.\nJesus\u2019 response to the high priest is a response from Psalm 110 and Daniel 7. He says \u201cfrom this moment,\u201d meaning that as soon as he is condemned to death, it is actually the beginning of his installment or coronation as the Son of Man, who will now be sitting at the \u201cright hand of the Father.\u201d Jesus is then given a robe and a crown of thorns and is crucified. This is his coronation as King of the universe.\nIn part four (40:40 -44:35), Tim gives a historical example of \u201cAlexamenos of Rome,\u201d an ancient piece of Roman graffiti depicting Christ being crucified, only in the image he has the head of a donkey.

            "content": "<p>This episode continues our series examining God as a character in the Bible. Today Tim and Jon dive deep into the story of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>\n<p>In part one (00:00-12:30), Tim outlines the historical path of Jesus. He says that within Jewish culture, Jesus stands unique. For example, in early Christian culture, there were hymns singing songs of praise to Jesus, not just about Jesus. Christians can \u201cpraise the name of Jesus\u201d and Paul can use the phrase \u201cmaranatha,\u201d which means \u201cour Lord come\u201d in Aramaic. Tim says the point is that Paul can write to a Hebrew or Greek audience with an Aramaic phrase and have it apparently make sense. The significance is that what Jews would have said about Yahweh\u2013\u2013\u201cour Lord come\u201d\u2013\u2013Christians were then saying about Jesus in Paul\u2019s letters. Tim says that by doing this you are essentially equating Jesus to Yahweh. Tim cites Larry Hurtado and his book One Lord, One God.</p>\n<p>In part two (12:30-22:45), Tim outlines the most common exalted claim made about Jesus by the first Jewish Christians. It was to use the language of Psalm 110:1-2 combined with Daniel 7.<br />\nPsalm 110 A poem of David:<br />\nYahweh says to my Lord:<br />\n\u201cSit at My right hand<br />\nUntil I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.\u201d<br />\nThe Lord will stretch forth Your strong scepter from Zion, saying,<br />\n\u201cRule in the midst of Your enemies.\u201d</p>\n<p>These lines are the most-quoted Old Testament text in the New Testament. It describes God taking a \u201cmaster/lord\u201d of King David and placing him on a throne that is next to the divine throne. It\u2019s quoted by Jesus himself inMark 12:36 and 14:62, by the apostles in Acts 2:33-35; 5:31; 7:55-56, and by the Apostle Paul in Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:25; Ephesians 1:20; 2:6; Colossians 3:1; Hebrews 1:3, 13; 8:1; 10:12-13; 12:2. It's also used in a Jewish context to claim that a human figure had been exalted to share in the divine rule over creation, which was equal to a claim that this figure shares in God\u2019s unique identity.</p>\n<p>Tim asks the burning historical question: How did this configuration of beliefs and practices come into existence? The New Testament offers an account for the origins of this exalted view of Jesus and their experience of him through the Spirit.</p>\n<p>In part three (22:45-37:00), Tim lays out more accounts of Jesus and says that Jesus positions himself as \u201cYahweh returning\u201d from the Old Testament. For example in Mark 1:1-3:<br />\n\u201cThe beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<br />\nAs it is written in Isaiah the prophet:<br />\n\u201cBehold, I send My messenger ahead of You,<br />\nWho will prepare Your way;<br />\nThe voice of one crying in the wilderness,<br />\n\u2018Make ready the way of the Lord,<br />\nMake His paths straight.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLord\u201d here is in Greek (kurios), the Greek Septuagint translation of \u201cYahweh.\u201d<br />\nIn Mark 1:4-8, John the baptist is introduced as the messenger voice in the wilderness. So In Mark 1:9, we\u2019re introduced to Jesus as kurios. Tim continues and says that with Jesus\u2019 baptism, the story is a Father, Son and Spirit love-fest.</p>\n<p>Mark 1:9-11:<br />\n&quot;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. Immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him; and a voice came out of the heavens [God as Father]. 'You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased.'&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim says the point is to demonstrate the unity of the triune God. Jesus is sent forth from God/Yahweh in the power of the Spirit.</p>\n<p>In part four (37:00-end), Tim says after the baptism that Jesus does \u201cYahweh alone\u201d things, such as forgiving people\u2019s sins. Mark 2:5-7: &quot;And Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.' But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 'Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?' [lit. \u201cthe one God\u201d]&quot;</p>\n<p>Jon asks about the relationship as a son and father. Why does Jesus call God his father? Tim says it\u2019s not like Yahweh gave birth to Jesus. It carries forward Old Testament ideas that the son, specifically the eldest son, is the chosen one who will carry on the father\u2019s mission.</p>\n<p>Tim says that while the title \u201cFather\u201d or \u201cmy Father\u201d or \u201cour Father\u201d can be confusing to modern readers, Jesus was fundamentally trying to show an intimate, precious relationship between him and Yahweh. Father is used in the Old Testament in Exodus when Yahweh refers to Israel as \u201cmy son.\u201d Further, Christians get this language uniquely from Jesus\u2019 own choice of that word to use it to describe Yahweh.</p>\n<p>Tim says that there is always a point in these type of conversations when things seem mysterious and confusing and people lack language to describe this aspect of God. Tim says he thinks that this is part of the beauty of the topic.</p>\n<p>Show Resources:</p>\n<p>Larry Hurtado One Lord, One God.<br />\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maranatha<br />\nOur video on God: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAvYmE2YYIU&amp;t=3s</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents<br />\nPraise Through The Valley, Tae the Producer<br />\nEden, Tae the Producer<br />\nMoments, Tae the Producer</p>\n<p>Show Produced By:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins, Matthew Halbert-Howen</p>\n",

            "content:encodedSnippet": "This episode continues our series examining God as a character in the Bible. Today Tim and Jon dive deep into the story of Jesus of Nazareth.\nIn part one (00:00-12:30), Tim outlines the historical path of Jesus. He says that within Jewish culture, Jesus stands unique. For example, in early Christian culture, there were hymns singing songs of praise to Jesus, not just about Jesus. Christians can \u201cpraise the name of Jesus\u201d and Paul can use the phrase \u201cmaranatha,\u201d which means \u201cour Lord come\u201d in Aramaic. Tim says the point is that Paul can write to a Hebrew or Greek audience with an Aramaic phrase and have it apparently make sense. The significance is that what Jews would have said about Yahweh\u2013\u2013\u201cour Lord come\u201d\u2013\u2013Christians were then saying about Jesus in Paul\u2019s letters. Tim says that by doing this you are essentially equating Jesus to Yahweh. Tim cites Larry Hurtado and his book One Lord, One God.\nIn part two (12:30-22:45), Tim outlines the most common exalted claim made about Jesus by the first Jewish Christians. It was to use the language of Psalm 110:1-2 combined with Daniel 7.\nThese lines are the most-quoted Old Testament text in the New Testament. It describes God taking a \u201cmaster/lord\u201d of King David and placing him on a throne that is next to the divine throne. It\u2019s quoted by Jesus himself inMark 12:36 and 14:62, by the apostles in Acts 2:33-35; 5:31; 7:55-56, and by the Apostle Paul in Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:25; Ephesians 1:20; 2:6; Colossians 3:1; Hebrews 1:3, 13; 8:1; 10:12-13; 12:2. It's also used in a Jewish context to claim that a human figure had been exalted to share in the divine rule over creation, which was equal to a claim that this figure shares in God\u2019s unique identity.\nTim asks the burning historical question: How did this configuration of beliefs and practices come into existence? The New Testament offers an account for the origins of this exalted view of Jesus and their experience of him through the Spirit.\nIn part three (22:45-37:00), Tim lays out more accounts of Jesus and says that Jesus positions himself as \u201cYahweh returning\u201d from the Old Testament. For example in Mark 1:1-3:\n\u201cLord\u201d here is in Greek (kurios), the Greek Septuagint translation of \u201cYahweh.\u201d\nMark 1:9-11:\nTim says the point is to demonstrate the unity of the triune God. Jesus is sent forth from God/Yahweh in the power of the Spirit.\nIn part four (37:00-end), Tim says after the baptism that Jesus does \u201cYahweh alone\u201d things, such as forgiving people\u2019s sins. Mark 2:5-7: \"And Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.' But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 'Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?'

            "content": "<p>This is another episode in our series on God\u2019s portrayal as a character in the Bible. In this episode Tim and Jon finally (finally!) begin to talk about Jesus. But in order to talk about him, they need to unpack a confusing phrase in the Bible, \u201cthe Son of Man.\u201d What\u2019s the story behind this phrase? It comes from a famous vision from Daniel chapter 7.</p>\n<p>In part one (00:00-19:45), the guys quickly review their conversation so far. Tim reiterates that God\u2019s portrayal in the Bible is extremely complex, and that\u2019s on purpose because God is complex. The biblical writers want to leave the reader with a sense of mystery about God\u2019s identity. Jon says that it\u2019s fundamentally impossible to completely understand a being that is other than you.</p>\n<p>Tim shares a quote from biblical scholar Mehrdad Fatehi, saying that for the biblical authors, \u201cYahweh cannot be reduced to any one of the manifestations of his presence (Word, Spirit, Wisdom, Angel, etc.). Yahweh is not completely identified with any one of these, but rather dynamically related. Yahweh is the Spirit, in so far as he is relating himself to creation. This is why the biblical writers prefer to speak of Yahweh\u2019s 'spirit,' or 'arm,' or 'glory,' or 'word,' rather than to refer to God himself in a more direct way. By adopting such a procedure, they manage both to express the objective reality of God\u2019s contact with his creation, and at the same time maintain that God himself is always greater than any specific act of revealing himself to someone.\u201d -- Mehrdad Fatehi, The Spirit\u2019s Relation to the Risen Lord in Paul\u2019s Letters, 57-58.</p>\n<p>In part two (19:45-38:10), Tim introduces the dream that Daniel has. He notes the design of the book of Daniel by saying that Daniel\u2019s dream is related to the other dreams and events in the book. The dream begins in verse 7:9-10:</p>\n<p>I kept looking<br />\nUntil thrones were set up,<br />\nAnd the Ancient of Days took His seat;<br />\nHis vesture was like white snow<br />\nAnd the hair of His head like pure wool.<br />\nHis throne was ablaze with flames,<br />\nIts wheels were a burning fire.<br />\n10 \u201cA river of fire was flowing<br />\nAnd coming out from before Him;<br />\nThousands upon thousands were attending Him,<br />\nAnd myriads upon myriads were standing before Him;<br />\nThe court sat,<br />\nAnd the books were opened.</p>\n<p>7:11-12: The super-beast is killed and thrown into the fire before the throne</p>\n<p>Daniel 7:13-14:<br />\nI kept looking in the night visions<br />\nAnd behold, with the clouds of heaven<br />\nOne like a son of human was coming,<br />\nAnd he came up to the Ancient of Days<br />\nAnd was presented before Him.<br />\n\u201cAnd to him was given dominion,<br />\nglory and ba kingdom,<br />\nThat all the peoples, nations<br />\nand languages Might serve (or \u201cworship\u201d) Him.<br />\nHis dominion is an everlasting dominion<br />\nWhich will not pass away;<br />\nAnd His kingdom is one<br />\nWhich will not be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Who is this Son of Man? Jon asks if it\u2019s a physical child. Tim explains that it's actually biblical imagery to depict a class of being. This is a \u201cson\u201d similar to the \u201csons of the prophets/Elijah\u201d depicted in the Old Testament. Tim says the point of the vision is that Daniel represents a summary of the future hope of the Hebrew Bible, and it envisions the coming of God\u2019s Kingdom as the coming of a human figure (\u201ca son of humanity\u201d), who will sit beside God, share in his rule over the beasts (remember the plural \u201cthrones\u201d), and receive worship from all nations.</p>\n<p>In part three (38:10-end), Tim says that the Christian claim of God existing \u201cthree in one\u201d and the divine complexity is a thoroughly Jewish idea, but Jews have long debated who the actual &quot;Son of Man&quot; is. Tim says there\u2019s a ancient Jewish author called Ezekiel the Tragedian, who believed that the vision of Daniel\u2019s Son of Man was actually referring to Moses.

            "content": "<p>This is a special episode in our series exploring the portrayal of God as a character in the Bible!</p>\n<p>In this episode, Tim and Jon host a friend of the Bible Project\u2019s, Dr. Michael Heiser. Dr Heiser is a Ph.D. in Hebrew studies from the University of Wisconsin. He\u2019s a well-published author whose work has been mentioned on this podcast before. He also runs his own podcast called \u201cThe Naked Bible Podcast\u201d.</p>\n<p>In part 1 (0-18:05), the guys begin to talk about God\u2019s \u201cname\u201d. This is a motif that is found throughout Scripture. Tim says that the Old Testament well primes the observant reader to expect an incarnation of God. The guys zero in on the commandment to not take God\u2019s name in vain. \u201cThou shalt not take the name of the Lord God in vain.\u201d What does this actually mean? Is it about cussing or something more? Dr. Heiser says the commandment is much more significant than most modern readers think.</p>\n<p>Tim shares a quote from Gerhard Von Rad\u2019s Old Testament Theology.<br />\n\u201cThe name Yahweh was committed in trust to Israel alone among the nations\u2026 In it alone lay the guarantee of Yahweh\u2019s nearness and of his readiness to help\u2026 This name shared directly in Yahweh\u2019s own holiness, for indeed it was, so to speak, a double of his being. And so it had to be treated as holy in the very heart of Israel\u2019s worship, to 'call on the name of Yahweh' was equivalent to true worship.\u201d -- Gerhard Von Rad, Old Testament Theology, Vol. 1, p. 183.</p>\n<p>Dr. Heiser says that to represent someone\u2019s name is a big deal. He says that to \u201cnot take the name in vain\u201d would be better translated to, \u201cdo not misrepresent the name.&quot;</p>\n<p>In part 2 (18:05- 33:00), the guys dive into more stories of God\u2019s name. Dr. Heiser makes a point that God incarnating happens repeatedly in the Old Testament, so it was expected that God would incarnate in the New Testament as the Messiah. Heiser says the question for an ancient Hebrew was not, &quot;Is it possible for God to incarnate in a human?&quot; but rather, &quot;Is Jesus the chosen one whom God has incarnated in?&quot;</p>\n<p>The guys zero in on some stories of the Angel of the Lord in the Old Testament.<br />\nDr. Heiser says that in the Exodus 23, the Angel has God\u2019s name \u201cin him\u201d. Then in Joshua 5, \u201cthe ruler of the Lord\u2019s army\u201d or \u201ccaptain of the hosts of the Lord\u201d appears to Joshua. Joshua is told to remove his shoes, for the ground is holy. This is the same language that appears in the story of Moses and the burning bush. In the burning bush story, it is the angel that is in the bush. Dr. Heiser says this is the same figure in all the stories. The angel is both an angel and Yahweh, yet is distinct from Yahweh.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (33:00-44:30) Tim and Dr. Heiser continue to make the point that God was known to incarnate in physical form. Dr. Heiser references Dr. Alan Segal, saying that ancient Judaism had a duality in it. God could be both Yahweh and distinct from Yahweh.</p>\n<p>Tim refers to Jesus\u2019 brothers who didn\u2019t believe Jesus was the Son of God when he was alive, but after his resurrection they did.<br />\nTim and Dr. Heiser also refer to John 17. Dr. Heiser says that when Jesus claims to have \u201cmanifested God\u2019s name\u201d he is claiming in other words, \u201cHe who has seen me has seen the Father.\u201d Jesus is the one who carried the name faithfully, doing the job Israel was supposed to.<br />\nTim says the claim being made in John 17 is behind the whole universe being in unity, a community of eternal love.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (44:30-end) The guys talk about the \u201cname\u201d or the \u201cmark\u201d of the beast in the book of Revelation.

Dr Heiser is a Ph.D. in Hebrew studies from the University of Wisconsin. He\u2019s a well-published author whose work has been mentioned on this podcast before. He also runs his own podcast called \u201cThe Naked Bible Podcast\u201d.</p>\n<p>In part 1 (0-18:05), the guys begin to talk about God\u2019s \u201cname\u201d. This is a motif that is found throughout Scripture. Tim says that the Old Testament well primes the observant reader to expect an incarnation of God. The guys zero in on the commandment to not take God\u2019s name in vain. \u201cThou shalt not take the name of the Lord God in vain.\u201d What does this actually mean? Is it about cussing or something more? Dr. Heiser says the commandment is much more significant than most modern readers think.</p>\n<p>Tim shares a quote from Gerhard Von Rad\u2019s Old Testament Theology.<br />\n\u201cThe name Yahweh was committed in trust to Israel alone among the nations\u2026 In it alone lay the guarantee of Yahweh\u2019s nearness and of his readiness to help\u2026 This name shared directly in Yahweh\u2019s own holiness, for indeed it was, so to speak, a double of his being. And so it had to be treated as holy in the very heart of Israel\u2019s worship, to 'call on the name of Yahweh' was equivalent to true worship.\u201d -- Gerhard Von Rad, Old Testament Theology, Vol. 1, p. 183.</p>\n<p>Dr. Heiser says that to represent someone\u2019s name is a big deal. He says that to \u201cnot take the name in vain\u201d would be better translated to, \u201cdo not misrepresent the name.&quot;</p>\n<p>In part 2 (18:05- 33:00), the guys dive into more stories of God\u2019s name. Dr. Heiser makes a point that God incarnating happens repeatedly in the Old Testament, so it was expected that God would incarnate in the New Testament as the Messiah. Heiser says the question for an ancient Hebrew was not, &quot;Is it possible for God to incarnate in a human?&quot; but rather, &quot;Is Jesus the chosen one whom God has incarnated in?&quot;</p>\n<p>The guys zero in on some stories of the Angel of the Lord in the Old Testament.<br />\nDr. Heiser says that in the Exodus 23, the Angel has God\u2019s name \u201cin him\u201d. Then in Joshua 5, \u201cthe ruler of the Lord\u2019s army\u201d or \u201ccaptain of the hosts of the Lord\u201d appears to Joshua. Joshua is told to remove his shoes, for the ground is holy. This is the same language that appears in the story of Moses and the burning bush. In the burning bush story, it is the angel that is in the bush. Dr. Heiser says this is the same figure in all the stories. The angel is both an angel and Yahweh, yet is distinct from Yahweh.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (33:00-44:30) Tim and Dr. Heiser continue to make the point that God was known to incarnate in physical form. Dr. Heiser references Dr. Alan Segal, saying that ancient Judaism had a duality in it. God could be both Yahweh and distinct from Yahweh.</p>\n<p>Tim refers to Jesus\u2019 brothers who didn\u2019t believe Jesus was the Son of God when he was alive, but after his resurrection they did.<br />\nTim and Dr. Heiser also refer to John 17. Dr. Heiser says that when Jesus claims to have \u201cmanifested God\u2019s name\u201d he is claiming in other words, \u201cHe who has seen me has seen the Father.\u201d Jesus is the one who carried the name faithfully, doing the job Israel was supposed to.<br />\nTim says the claim being made in John 17 is behind the whole universe being in unity, a community of eternal love.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (44:30-end) The guys talk about the \u201cname\u201d or the \u201cmark\u201d of the beast in the book of Revelation. Dr. Heiser says this is also much more significant than modern readers realize.

            "content": "<p>This episode continues our series on the development of God as a character in the Bible. This week Tim and Jon have part two of their conversation on God\u2019s attributes used as a character. They discuss God\u2019s Spirit, God\u2019s wisdom, and God\u2019s word.</p>\n<p>In part one (0 - 33:05), the guys briefly recap last week\u2019s discussion on \u201cGod\u2019s Glory.\u201d Then Tim outlines the attribute of God\u2019s word. Tim outlines the first story where \u201cGod\u2019s word\u201d is used. Genesis 15:1: &quot;After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision, saying, 'Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward shall be very great.'&quot;</p>\n<p>\u201cThe word\u201d is the subject of the verbs (\u201ccame\u201d \u201cspoke\u201d). it is \u201cseen\u201d in a vision, and it speaks in first-person divine speech. Tim says that often this nuance gets overlooked, that God\u2019s word appeared in visible form. It\u2019s depicted as a character that can appear to someone. Tim says the point is that often times the weird wording is intentional and should not be overlooked.</p>\n<p>Tim shares another story in the Old Testament about God\u2019s word. 1 Samuel 3:1-7: &quot;Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the Lord before Eli. And the word of Yahweh was rare in those days, visions were infrequent\u2026 and Samuel was lying down in the temple of Yahweh where the ark of God was\u2026 then Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, 'Here I am.' Then he ran to Eli and said, 'Here I am, for you called me.' But he said, 'I did not call, lie down again.' So he went and lay down. Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh, nor had the word of Yahweh yet been revealed [lit. \u201cmade visible\u201d] to him\u2026. Then Yahweh came and stood and called as at other times, 'Samuel! Samuel!' And Samuel said, 'Speak, for Your servant is listening.'&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim shares a final story on God\u2019s word. Jeremiah 1:1-9: \u201cThe words of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah...to whom the word of Yahweh came\u2026 [v.4] Now the word of Yahweh came to me saying, 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you\u2026' [v.6] Then I said 'O Yahweh Elohim, I don\u2019t know how to speak, I\u2019m just a youth\u2026' [v.7] Then Yahweh said to me, 'Don\u2019t say \u2018I\u2019m just a youth\u2026\u2019' [v.9] Then Yahweh stretched out his hand and touched my mouth and Yahweh said to me, 'Look I have put my words in your mouth.'&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim says the point is that in all of these passages, Yahweh and Yahweh\u2019s word are the same, and yet distinct. Yahweh\u2019s word is a physical embodiment (it can appear, be seen, it has hands, etc.).</p>\n<p>So in light of all of this new information, let\u2019s go back to Genesis 1:1-3: \u201cIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters. Then God spoke, 'Let there be light'; and there was light. God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.&quot;</p>\n<p>God\u2019s identity has three facets in this opening scene:<br />\nGod, God\u2019s ruakh (breath, invisible presence), and God's word. Tim then draws attention to Psalm 33:6, 9: \u201cBy the word of Yahweh the heavens were made, all their hosts by the ruakh of his mouth\u2026 For he spoke, and it was, He commanded, and it stood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim moves on to discuss God\u2019s Spirit. God\u2019s Spirit is his invisible personal presence, that is God himself as he is experienced by people and personally present in the world. God\u2019s Spirit influences and works through human agents, especially these type of people in the Bible:</p>\n<p>Prophets: Micah 3:8: &quot;On the other hand I am filled with power\u2014with the Spirit of Yahweh\u2014and with justice and courage, to make known to Jacob his rebellious act, even to Israel his sin.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kings: 1 Samuel 16:13: &quot;Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily upon David from that day forward.&quot;</p>\n<p>Wise people: Genesis 41:38-39: (Joseph) \u201cPharaoh said to his servants, 'Where else can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of Gods? \u2026 There is no one with wisdom or understanding like him.'\u201d</p>\n<p>Artists and Leaders: Exodus 31:1-4: (Bezalel) \u201cThen Yahweh said to Moses, 'Look I have chosen Bezalel...and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom and understanding, with knowledge and skills, to make designs in gold and silver\u2026'&quot;<br />\nDeuteronomy 34:9: (Joshua) \u201cNow Joshua son of Nun was filled with the Spirit of Wisdom.\u201d</p>\n<p>God\u2019s Spirit = the divine thoughts and purposes = \u201cmind\u201d<br />\nIsaiah 40:13-14: &quot;Who has measured the ruakh of Yahweh, And who has informed him with advice? With whom did He take counsel, to be given knowledge? Who taught him...knowledge, or who informed him with understanding?&quot; Notice this close connection between God's Spirit and God\u2019s wisdom.</p>\n<p>Jon makes a fun analogy by pretending he\u2019s a gerbil. If he was a gerbil and he were to see Tim as a human, he would only understand limited ways that Tim interacted with him. So similarly, when biblical authors experienced God through one of his attributes, they recognized that it wasn't God in his entirety but rather an aspect of him with which humans have been able to interact.</p>\n<p>In part two (33:05-46:10), Tim continues to outline God\u2019s Spirit. Jon says that he doesn\u2019t think of his presence or mind as an attribute. So why is God\u2019s presence/Spirit considered an attribute?<br />\nThe guys have a brief discussion on the different ideas in philosophy and science asking, \u201cIs our mind distinct from our ourselves, or is it ourselves?&quot; Tim comments that it\u2019s hard for a modern person to have an understanding of God, a being with a mind, but with no known \u201chardware.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part three (46:10-52:30), Tim outlines God\u2019s wisdom. Tim says that all of the attributes are designed to flow in an out of each other. So when someone acts under or with God\u2019s Spirit, they are also acting with God\u2019s wisdom.<br />\nTim says in the Bible, God\u2019s wisdom is depicted as an influential urban woman who calls out to humanity. This is literary personification. Proverbs 8: 8:1-2: \u201cDoesn\u2019t wisdom call out, and understanding offer her voice. At the top of the heights, by the crossroads she stands\u2026\u201d 8:15-16 \u201cBy means of me kings reign, and leaders make just laws. By means of me rulers rule, and officials, and all those who rule with justice.\u201d 8:22-23: &quot;Yahweh possessed me at the beginning of his way, before any of his works of old. From ancient times I was appointed, from the beginning, from the oldest times\u2026&quot; 8:30&quot; \u201cI was beside him as an \u2018amon\u2019, I was delighting day by day, rejoicing before him.\u201d</p>\n<p>&quot;Amon&quot; is an ambiguous word, used only here in ancient Hebrew and is capable of multiple interpretations. It could mean \u201cworkman,&quot; &quot;apprentice,\u201d but also \u201cchild,&quot; &quot;nursing-child.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part four (52:30-end), the guys jump into the New Testament, specifically John 1. Tim says God\u2019s word, Spirit, wisdom, and Genesis 1 are all creatively retold in John 1, but now Jesus is the central character.<br />\nIn this first chapter, John says as clearly as he can that Jesus is Yahweh, but he is also distinct from Yahweh.</p>\n<p>Jon asks what &quot;only begotten son&quot; means in the Bible? Tim answers that there have been lots of debates over time. The phrase comes from the Greek phrase, &quot;monogen\u00eds gios.&quot; Some have suggested that it means \u201cthe only born son,&quot; whereas other theologians have suggested it means \u201conly of its kind.\u201d Tim suggests that people shift their language away from \u201conly begotten\u201d to something like \u201cJesus is the one and only unique son of all the spiritual beings because he actually shares in God\u2019s identity and is one with God.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim offers that in pop culture, often times people are skeptical of the idea of \u201cthe trinity.\u201d They think that because the word \u201ctrinity\u201d doesn\u2019t appear in the Bible, it might be a later invention of Christianity.</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nFrederick Danker Dictionary.<br />\nFind all our resources at www.thebible.project.com</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents<br />\nPraise Through The Valley, Tae The Producer<br />\nAnother Chance, Tae the Producer<br />\nHe\u2019s Always There.

They discuss God\u2019s Spirit, God\u2019s wisdom, and God\u2019s word.\nIn part one (0 - 33:05), the guys briefly recap last week\u2019s discussion on \u201cGod\u2019s Glory.\u201d Then Tim outlines the attribute of God\u2019s word. Tim outlines the first story where \u201cGod\u2019s word\u201d is used. Genesis 15:1: \"After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision, saying, 'Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward shall be very great.'\"\n\u201cThe word\u201d is the subject of the verbs (\u201ccame\u201d \u201cspoke\u201d). it is \u201cseen\u201d in a vision, and it speaks in first-person divine speech. Tim says that often this nuance gets overlooked, that God\u2019s word appeared in visible form. It\u2019s depicted as a character that can appear to someone. Tim says the point is that often times the weird wording is intentional and should not be overlooked.\nTim shares another story in the Old Testament about God\u2019s word. 1 Samuel 3:1-7: \"Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the Lord before Eli. And the word of Yahweh was rare in those days, visions were infrequent\u2026 and Samuel was lying down in the temple of Yahweh where the ark of God was\u2026 then Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, 'Here I am.' Then he ran to Eli and said, 'Here I am, for you called me.' But he said, 'I did not call, lie down again.' So he went and lay down. Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh, nor had the word of Yahweh yet been revealed [lit. \u201cmade visible\u201d] to him\u2026. Then Yahweh came and stood and called as at other times, 'Samuel! Samuel!' And Samuel said, 'Speak, for Your servant is listening.'\"\nTim shares a final story on God\u2019s word. Jeremiah 1:1-9: \u201cThe words of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah...to whom the word of Yahweh came\u2026 [v.4] Now the word of Yahweh came to me saying, 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you\u2026' [v.6] Then I said 'O Yahweh Elohim, I don\u2019t know how to speak, I\u2019m just a youth\u2026' [v.7] Then Yahweh said to me, 'Don\u2019t say \u2018I\u2019m just a youth\u2026\u2019' [v.9] Then Yahweh stretched out his hand and touched my mouth and Yahweh said to me, 'Look I have put my words in your mouth.'\"\nTim says the point is that in all of these passages, Yahweh and Yahweh\u2019s word are the same, and yet distinct. Yahweh\u2019s word is a physical embodiment (it can appear, be seen, it has hands, etc.).\nSo in light of all of this new information, let\u2019s go back to Genesis 1:1-3: \u201cIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters. Then God spoke, 'Let there be light'; and there was light. God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.\"\nGod\u2019s identity has three facets in this opening scene:\nTim moves on to discuss God\u2019s Spirit. God\u2019s Spirit is his invisible personal presence, that is God himself as he is experienced by people and personally present in the world. God\u2019s Spirit influences and works through human agents, especially these type of people in the Bible:\nProphets: Micah 3:8: \"On the other hand I am filled with power\u2014with the Spirit of Yahweh\u2014and with justice and courage, to make known to Jacob his rebellious act, even to Israel his sin.\"\nKings: 1 Samuel 16:13: \"Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily upon David from that day forward.\"\nWise people: Genesis 41:38-39: (Joseph) \u201cPharaoh said to his servants, 'Where else can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of Gods? \u2026 There is no one with wisdom or understanding like him.'\u201d\nArtists and Leaders: Exodus 31:1-4: (Bezalel) \u201cThen Yahweh said to Moses, 'Look I have chosen Bezalel...and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom and understanding, with knowledge and skills, to make designs in gold and silver\u2026'\"\nGod\u2019s Spirit = the divine thoughts and purposes = \u201cmind\u201d\nJon makes a fun analogy by pretending he\u2019s a gerbil. If he was a gerbil and he were to see Tim as a human, he would only understand limited ways that Tim interacted with him. So similarly, when biblical authors experienced God through one of his attributes, they recognized that it wasn't God in his entirety but rather an aspect of him with which humans have been able to interact.\nIn part two (33:05-46:10), Tim continues to outline God\u2019s Spirit. Jon says that he doesn\u2019t think of his presence or mind as an attribute. So why is God\u2019s presence/Spirit considered an attribute?\nIn part three (46:10-52:30), Tim outlines God\u2019s wisdom. Tim says that all of the attributes are designed to flow in an out of each other. So when someone acts under or with God\u2019s Spirit, they are also acting with God\u2019s wisdom.\n\"Amon\" is an ambiguous word, used only here in ancient Hebrew and is capable of multiple interpretations. It could mean \u201cworkman,\" \"apprentice,\u201d but also \u201cchild,\" \"nursing-child.\u201d\nIn part four (52:30-end), the guys jump into the New Testament, specifically John 1. Tim says God\u2019s word, Spirit, wisdom, and Genesis 1 are all creatively retold in John 1, but now Jesus is the central character.\nJon asks what \"only begotten son\" means in the Bible? Tim answers that there have been lots of debates over time. The phrase comes from the Greek phrase, \"monogen\u00eds gios.\" Some have suggested that it means \u201cthe only born son,\" whereas other theologians have suggested it means \u201conly of its kind.\u201d Tim suggests that people shift their language away from \u201conly begotten\u201d to something like \u201cJesus is the one and only unique son of all the spiritual beings because he actually shares in God\u2019s identity and is one with God.\u201d\nTim offers that in pop culture, often times people are skeptical of the idea of \u201cthe trinity.\u201d They think that because the word \u201ctrinity\u201d doesn\u2019t appear in the Bible, it might be a later invention of Christianity.\nShow Resources:\nShow Music:\nDefender Instrumental, Tents\nPraise Through The Valley, Tae The Producer\nAnother Chance, Tae the Producer\nHe\u2019s Always There.

            "content": "<p>This episode continues our series on the development of God as a character in the Bible! Today Tim and Jon zoom in on a confusing part of the Bible: God\u2019s attributes, specifically, God\u2019s name, glory, word, spirit, and wisdom. Today Tim and Jon will be covering the first two attributes, God\u2019s name and his glory.</p>\n<p>In part one (0-7:15), Tim outlines God\u2019s name in the Bible. Think of God\u2019s name as his \u201creputation,\u201d and his name is a big deal in the Bible. Tim briefly outlines and says that God\u2019s attributes take on a life of their own. Literally. The attributes play a similar role in the story of the bible that the Angel of Yahweh does. The attribute can be both distinct from and be Yahweh.</p>\n<p>Tim says that the first time God\u2019s name is revealed in the Bible is at the burning bush in the story of Moses in Exodus 3. God reveals his divine name to Moses, and it is utterly unique and undefinable: \u201cI am who I am.\u201d Yahweh = he is who he is.</p>\n<p>Tim shares a quote from scholar Gerhard Von Rad: \u201cThe name Yahweh was committed in trust to Israel alone among the nations\u2026 In it alone lay the guarantee of Yahweh\u2019s nearness and of his readiness to help\u2026 This name shared directly in Yahweh\u2019s own holiness, for indeed it was, so to speak, a double of his being. And so it had to be treated as holy in the very heart of Israel\u2019s worship, to 'call on the name of Yahweh' was equivalent to true worship.\u201d Von Rad Old Testament Theology, Vol. 1, p. 183.</p>\n<p>In part two (7:15-25:55), Tim continues and says that in Deuteronomy we see a fascinating repeated phrase. Moses says that when Israel crosses into the promised land, God will lead them to set up a place of worship, a temple: Deuteronomy 12:4 says, \u201cYou are to worship at the place Yahweh your God will choose from among all the tribes to place his name there for it to dwell/take up residence. That\u2019s where you will seek him and go there.\u201d Deuteronomy 12:11 says, \u201cAnd the place where Yahweh your God chooses to cause his name to dwell, that\u2019s where you will bring your offerings\u2026\u201d<br />\nTim says the point is that the unique name of Yahweh in this phrase is personified like a person or being who \u201clives/dwells\u201d in the temple.</p>\n<p>Tim moves on and outlines another attribute, God\u2019s glory. God\u2019s kavod = the physical manifestation of God\u2019s important status. Tim highlights Exodus 24:9-11 and God's glory on Mount Sinai. &quot;Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and they saw the God of Israel; and under his feet there appeared to be a pavement platform of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself. Yet he did not stretch out his hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; and they saw God, and they ate and drank.&quot;</p>\n<p>While this passage doesn\u2019t use the word kavod, they see a physical manifestation of God. This isn\u2019t the only story of a physical manifestation of God. In 1 Kings 22:19, the prophet Micaiah says, \u201cTherefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right and on his left.&quot;<br />\nThen again in Isaiah 6:1-3, &quot;In the year of King Uzziah\u2019s death I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of his robe filling the temple. Seraphim stood above him, each having six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called out to another and said: \u201cHoly, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts, The whole earth is full of gis glory (kavod).\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says the point is that there is uniformity in these stories. Everyone sees a glorious seated royal figure. Then Tim expands the point with a crazy story in Ezekiel chapter 1.<br />\n\u201cNow it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God...<br />\nAs I looked, behold, a storm wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing forth continually and a bright light around it, and in its midst something like glowing metal in the midst of the fire.<br />\nNow over the heads of the living beings there was something like a platform (Hebrew word, raqia, from Genesis 1), like the awesome gleam of crystal, spread out over their heads.<br />\nNow above the platform that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, like sapphire in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne, high up, was a figure with the appearance of a human. Then I noticed from the appearance of his loins and upward something like glowing metal that looked like fire all around within it, and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw something like fire; and there was a radiance around him. As the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh. And when I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s point is that the Ezekiel story is a culmination of this theme. God\u2019s glory and God can be both distinct and indistinguishable from each other. Tim also offers Psalm 26:8. \u201cO Yahweh, I love the house where you dwell, the place where your glory (kavod) dwells.\u201d As a final point, Tim says that all the attributes can weave in and out of each other. God\u2019s glory can also dwell somewhere, just like his name can.</p>\n<p>In part three (25:55-end), Tim takes a sneak peak at how these themes of God\u2019s attributes pay off when reading the New Testament. Tim dives into John 17. This passage is often called Jesus\u2019 \u201chigh priestly prayer.\u201d</p>\n<p>John 17:1-3, 5: \u201cFather, the hour has come; glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you, even as you gave him authority over all flesh, that to all whom you have given him, he may give eternal life. This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent...Now, Father, glorify me together with yourself, with the glory which I had with you before the world was.\u201d Tim says the point here is that Jesus was the pre-existent word and wisdom of God, and the embodiment of his divine glory.</p>\n<p>Then in John 17:11, we see, \u201cHoly Father, keep them in your name, the name which you have given me, that they may be one even as we are one.\u201d Tim says that Jesus and the Father bear \u201cthe name\u201d showing that they are one.</p>\n<p>John 17:20-26: \u201cI do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in me through their word; that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me and I in you, that also they may be in us, so that the world may believe that you sent me. The glory which you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as we are one; I in them and you in me, that they may be perfected in one-ness, so that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you have loved me. Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am, so that they may see my glory which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, although the world has not known you, yet I have known you; and these have known that you sent me; and I have made your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of our supporters!<br />\nCheck out all our free resources on www.thebibleproject.com</p>\n<p>Show Produced by:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents<br />\nHe\u2019s Always There, Tae the Producer<br />\nAnother Chance, Tae the Producer</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nVon Rad Old Testament Theology, Vol. 1, p. 183</p>\n",

O righteous Father, although the world has not known you, yet I have known you; and these have known that you sent me; and I have made your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.\u201d\nThank you to all of our supporters!\nShow Produced by:\nShow Music:\nShow Resources:\nVon Rad Old Testament Theology, Vol. 1, p. 183",

Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since my name is in him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jon asks what it means to have Yahweh\u2019s name in someone. Tim says this is a really unique phrase in the Bible. Tim thinks the point is that there\u2019s a balance beam the biblical authors are walking. They want to present Yahweh as distinct from the Angel of God, but also they can be the same.</p>\n<p>In part three (17:25-26:55), Tim outlines the story of Gideon in Judges 6:11-23.<br />\n&quot;The Angel of the Lord came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites. When the Angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon, he said, 'The Lord is with you, mighty warrior.' 'Pardon me, my lord,' Gideon replied, 'but if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, \u2018Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?\u2019 But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.' The Lord turned to him and said, 'Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian\u2019s hand. Am I not sending you?' 'Pardon me, my lord,' Gideon replied, 'but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.' The Lord answered, 'I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive.' Gideon replied, 'If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me. Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.' And the Lord said, 'I will wait until you return.' Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. The Angel of God said to him, 'Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.' And Gideon did so. Then the Angel of the Lord touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the Angel of the Lord disappeared. When Gideon realized that it was the Angel of the Lord, he exclaimed, 'Alas, Sovereign Lord! I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face!' But the Lord said to him, 'Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.'&quot;</p>\n<p>In this story, the character keeps alternating between \u201cthe Lord\u201d and \u201cthe Angel of the Lord.\u201d Why is this? Is this just lazy writing, or is it a biblical contradiction? Tim says he thinks this is a strange story on purpose. Tim thinks that this is a human figure that can appear, a figure that is Yahweh but also distinct from Yahweh. The point of this story is to form a mental shelf in the reader's mind that there is a human figure, a messenger who acts as God and also on behalf of God. This figure has \u201cmy name in Him,\u201d according to Exodus 23.</p>\n<p>In Part four (26:55-end), Tim outlines the history of the ideas surrounding this figure. Some traditions and scholars think that this figure is Michael, archangel or chief angel. Tim says there\u2019s a book called \u201cThe Apocalypse of Abraham.\u201d It's a second temple Jewish text that tries to give more background on this figure. In that text the figure is called \u201cYa-ho-el.\u201d</p>\n<p>In other Jewish traditions, the Angel of the Lord is known as Metatron. The early church fathers believed that this being was a pre-incarnated Jesus. Tim says there are lots of ideas, and the biblical authors, especially the New Testament authors, consider Jesus to be \u201cgreater than an angel.\u201d This theme is especially noticeable in the book of Hebrews. To a modern reader, the meaning slips past us, but to an ancient Jewish reader, saying that Jesus was \u201cgreater than an angel\u201d or that he was the Angel of Yahweh was equivalent to saying that he was Yahweh.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of our supporters!</p>\n<p>Show Music<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents<br />\nHe\u2019s Always There, Tae the Producer<br />\nAnother Chance, Tae the Producer<br />\nIn the Distance, Tae the Producer<br />\nHe\u2019s Always There, Tae the Producer</p>\n<p>Produced By:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins.</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron<br />\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Abraham</p>\n",

This figure has \u201cmy name in Him,\u201d according to Exodus 23.\nIn Part four (26:55-end), Tim outlines the history of the ideas surrounding this figure. Some traditions and scholars think that this figure is Michael, archangel or chief angel. Tim says there\u2019s a book called \u201cThe Apocalypse of Abraham.\u201d It's a second temple Jewish text that tries to give more background on this figure. In that text the figure is called \u201cYa-ho-el.\u201d\nIn other Jewish traditions, the Angel of the Lord is known as Metatron. The early church fathers believed that this being was a pre-incarnated Jesus. Tim says there are lots of ideas, and the biblical authors, especially the New Testament authors, consider Jesus to be \u201cgreater than an angel.\u201d This theme is especially noticeable in the book of Hebrews. To a modern reader, the meaning slips past us, but to an ancient Jewish reader, saying that Jesus was \u201cgreater than an angel\u201d or that he was the Angel of Yahweh was equivalent to saying that he was Yahweh.\nThank you to all of our supporters!\nShow Music\nProduced By:\nShow Resources:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Abraham",
            "contentSnippet": "In part one (0:00-7:35), Tim outlines the biblical authors' idea that God is totally transcendent and above creation, but they also work hard to show that God gets involved in human activities through mediators. Tim briefly mentions that there are a lot of old Hebrew traditions surrounding different beings like \u201cthe watchers.\u201d These figures are often portrayed in movies like the new Noah movie by Darren Aronofsky. and much of the literature written about them comes from other Hebrew literature and tradition.\nIn part two (7:35-17:25), Tim says that the Hebrew word \u201cmalak\u201d means \u201cmessenger,\u201d and it's the word used for \u201cangel.\u201d In the New Testament, the Greek word \u201caggelos\u201d is used, which is then translated as \u201cangel.\u201d Jon asks if they have wings, and Tim says there is no winged angel depicted in the Bible.\nTim says there\u2019s a particular elohim/spiritual being depicted in the Bible that is called \u201cmalak Yahweh,\u201d or \u201cmessenger of Yahweh.\u201d One notable appearance of this character is in the story of Hagar in Genesis 21. The story starts out with Hagar conversing with the Angel of the Lord, but then later she says she had conversed with God (Yahweh).\nJon asks if this is a sign of the literary seams of different sources as this story was told throughout the years. Tim says this is possible, but he also wonders if it\u2019s intentional. Is the Angel of Yahweh Yahweh, or is it distinct from Yahweh? Tim thinks it's both.\nTim mentions the story in Exodus 23. Yahweh says, \u201cSee, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared. Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since my name is in him.\u201d\nJon asks what it means to have Yahweh\u2019s name in someone. Tim says this is a really unique phrase in the Bible. Tim thinks the point is that there\u2019s a balance beam the biblical authors are walking. They want to present Yahweh as distinct from the Angel of God, but also they can be the same.\nIn part three (17:25-26:55), Tim outlines the story of Gideon in Judges 6:11-23.\nIn this story, the character keeps alternating between \u201cthe Lord\u201d and \u201cthe Angel of the Lord.\u201d Why is this? Is this just lazy writing, or is it a biblical contradiction? Tim says he thinks this is a strange story on purpose. Tim thinks that this is a human figure that can appear, a figure that is Yahweh but also distinct from Yahweh. The point of this story is to form a mental shelf in the reader's mind that there is a human figure, a messenger who acts as God and also on behalf of God. This figure has \u201cmy name in Him,\u201d according to Exodus 23.\nIn Part four (26:55-end), Tim outlines the history of the ideas surrounding this figure.

            "content": "<p>This episode continues our series on the development of the character of God in the Bible. In this episode, the guys discuss one of the strangest stories in the Bible: Israel and the golden calf in Exodus 32.</p>\n<p>In part one (00:00-09:45), the guys review the idea that God primarily interacts with the world through a human mediator. Understanding how God interacted with Israel through Moses is key to understanding this important theme in the Bible. Tim points out that in the Old Testament, the two most important personal portraits to understand are David and Moses. They are the two people who get the most page length in the Old Testament. Tim says that Moses' story should be creating a role, an expectation that the world would be a better place if there were more Moses-like characters who are intimately tied with Yahweh.</p>\n<p>In part two (09:45-21:20), the guys talk about the story of the golden calf in Exodus 32. Moses represents Israel to God and he represents God to Israel. Tim points out a strange detail of the story. God says he wants to destroy Israel, but then it seems as though God changes his mind after Moses implored him to reconsider.</p>\n<p>Tim says this story has puzzled all Bible readers over thousands of years. Does God change his mind based on human input? Tim quotes from biblical scholar Christopher Wright's commentary on Deuteronomy:<br />\n\u201cThis story explores the mystery about prayer in general and intercession in particular, and raises questions: Was God really serious in this declared threat? If Moses had not interceded, would God have carried out the destruction of Israel? If God was not really planning to destroy the people (10:10b), did God only \u201cpretend\u201d to listen to Moses\u2019 prayer? Did Moses actually change God\u2019s mind?<br />\nIt seems important first of all to say that there is not much point in wrestling with alternative hypothetical scenarios posed by such questions. Asking \u201cwhat if\u201d serves little theological purpose. Both God and Moses appear to be behaving straightforwardly. There is nothing in the text to suggest that God\u2019s anger was overdone for mere effect; no suggestion that God\u2019s threat was a bluff intended to secure a hasty repentance. The threat of destruction was real. Likewise, Moses\u2019 reaction to the divine wrath was not a patronizing dismissal of authority, like saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!\u201d Rather, Moses recognized that this was a sincere threat that could be countered only with appeal to prior words and actions of the same God. The paradox is that in appealing to God to change, he was actually appealing to God to be consistent \u2014which may be a significant clue to the dynamic of all genuine intercessory prayer.<br />\nYet perhaps there is a hint of the divine intention in God\u2019s fascinating words, Leave me alone\u2026 (v. 14). The discussion of this line in Jewish scholarship has sensed deep meaning here. After all, God need not have spoken such words, or indeed any words at all, to Moses. In wrath God could have acted \u201cimmediately\u201d without informing or consulting Moses in any way. God pauses and makes the divine will \u201cvulnerable\u201d to human challenge.<br />\nThe fact is that, far from human intercession being an irritating but occasionally successful intrusion upon divinely prefabricated blueprints for history, Moses\u2019 prayer becomes an integral part of the way God\u2019s sovereignty in history is exercised. That does not totally solve the mystery, but it puts it in its proper biblical perspective. God not only allows human intercession, God invites it and builds it into the decision-making processes of the heavenly council in ways we can never fathom. \u201cGod takes Moses\u2019 contribution with utmost seriousness; God\u2019s acquiescence to the arguments indicates that God treats the conversation with Moses with integrity and honors the human insight as an important ingredient for the shaping of the future\u201d<br />\nIntercessory prayer, then, flows primarily not from human anxiety about God but from God\u2019s commitment to covenant relationship with human beings\u2026. Moses was not so much arguing against God, as participating in an argument within God. Such prayer, therefore, not only participates in the pain of God in history, but is actually invited to do so for God\u2019s sake as well as ours. This is a measure of the infinite value to God of commitment to persons in covenant relationship.<br />\nThe Point: The figure of Moses in the Torah creates a portrait of the kind of figure necessary for God and humanity to exist together in successful covenant relationship. Moses\u2019 eventual failure in the wilderness (Numbers ch. 21) disqualifies him for the role he filled. His story creates a \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d sign in the biblical narrative.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part three (21:20-33:30), the guys continue to discuss the story of the golden calf. Jon summarizes Tim\u2019s position. Tim draws another parallel to the story of the great flood in Genesis. God destroys all of humanity except for Noah and his family. Then God says that \u201cI will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man\u2019s heart is evil, from his youth\u201d (Genesis 8:21). This is a paradox; God has just pronounced mankind as evil, but he refuses to destroy them or break relationship with them. Tim says that the Hebrew Bible is pointing forward to a person who they want to be a \u201cbetter Moses.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part four (33:30-39:50), Tim shares a quote from The Screwtape Letters by CS Lewis.<br />\n\u201cOne must face the fact that all the talk about His love for men, and His service being perfect freedom, is not (as one would gladly believe) mere propaganda, but an appalling truth. He really does want to fill the universe with a lot of loathsome little replicas of Himself\u2014creatures, whose life, on its miniature scale, will be qualitatively like His own, not because He has absorbed them but because their wills freely conform to His. We want cattle who can finally become food. He wants servants who can finally become sons. We want to suck in, He wants to give out. We are<br />\nempty and would be filled; He is full and flows over. Our war aim is a world in which Our Father Below has drawn all other beings into himself: the Enemy wants a world full of beings united to Him but still distinct.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part five (39:50-end), Tim shares the evolution of the portrait of Moses in the book of Isaiah. Isaiah says that the hoped for figure who can save Israel is a mashup between the best characteristics of David and Moses. Israel needs a priest and a king; this person is Jesus. But Jon makes a point that if the idea is that Israel only needs an \u201cexalted human\u201d to save them, then theology like a Jehovah\u2019s Witness that claims that Jesus was only an exalted human begins to form.</p>\n<p>Tim sees this point. Many people throughout history have thought that Jesus was only an \u201cexalted human,\u201d but the apostles and authors of the New Testament believed that Jesus was also divine. For example in 2 Corinthians 3-4 and the book of Hebrews, the claim is that Jesus was not just \u201canother Moses,\u201d he was greater than Moses. Tim says that the New Testament author's claims that Jesus is divine can sometimes be hard to see to modern readers because they make the claims in very Jewish ways. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2 that Jesus is \u201cthe wisdom of God.\u201d This sounds nice to modern readers, but to an ancient Hebrew rabbi, it would be blasphemous because claiming to be his wisdom is equivalent to claiming to be one with God. Ancient Jews would have no problem claiming that Jesus was a mediator \u201clike\u201d Moses, but saying he was greater eventually leads to the split between the Messianic Jews and other Jewish communities.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of our supporters!</p>\n<p>Next week is a big episode for us.

Baukham outlines the differences between ancient Judiasm and other ancient religions of that time period. Specifically a \u201cBinary view\u201d vs. a \u201cgradient view\u201d of reality. A \u201cgradient view\u201d can be characterized as: polytheistic worldviews (like Israel\u2019s ancient neighbors, and the Greek and Roman world) draw distinctions of degree between the most powerful divine being and other divine beings and humans.</p>\n<p>A \u201cbinary view\u201d can be characterized, by looking at this quote from Richard Baukman \u201cMonotheism understands the uniqueness of the one God in terms of an absolute difference in kind from all other reality. We could call it \u2018transcendent uniqueness\u2026 understanding the uniqueness of the God of Israel as that of the one Creator of all things and the one sovereign Ruler of all things. In ancient Judaism, this binary distinction between their God and all other reality was observed and promoted by monolotry -- their worship and allegiance and prayers were offered only to the one God of Israel. In a gradient worldview, many beings are accorded honor, to the degree appropriate to their rank on the cosmic scale. Judaism turned their monolotry into a powerful symbol of exclusive monotheism.\u201d -- Bauckham, Jesus and the God of Israel, 109.</p>\n<p>Why is this important? Because a binary view of reality eventually sets the stage for Israel\u2019s belief that God can be both transcendent and personally knowable. And the biblical authors paint a picture of God who can be relatable to the world most often through a human mediator, but at the same time can be utterly unknowable. Tim says that these overarching thoughts set the stage for Christian beliefs like the incarnation and the trinity.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (20:20-25:20), Tim outlines \u201cGod\u2019s complex relationship with the world\u201d. When you pick up the Bible you first notice that God is portrayed as very relatable, with human like qualities. In Genesis, God is portrayed as walking around the garden. Other times, God\u2019s attributes becomes personified, his wisdom, his justice etc all have stories where they act as a character.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (25:20-40:00), Tim outlines portrayals of God through humans. When Genesis starts, God self limits himself by willingly wanting to partner with humans who are made in his image and commissioned to rule the world on his behalf. What\u2019s the problem with that? Humans rebel. But God continues to work through humans who he uses to accomplish his purposes. The first person that is a great example of this is Moses.</p>\n<p>When God calls Moses at the burning bush in Exodus 3, God says he will deliver Israel out of Egypt, but then he tells Moses to go do it. Tim says this is a good example, that most stories in the Bible show God acting through a person, or a mediator and its actually very rare to see God doing something without a mediator.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (40:00-end), Tim expands on this point by illustrating the biblical theme of \u201cGod\u2019s outstretched arm\u201d. Where does this image come from? Does God actually have an arm? Tim says this theme starts in the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7). \u201cThen Yahweh said to Moses\u2026 \u201cGo to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, stand on the bank and take in your hand the staff\u2026 and say \u201cThus says Yahweh the God of the Hebrews, \u2018By this you will know that I am Yahweh, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile and it will turn to blood.\u2019 Then Moses did as Yahweh commanded\u2026 he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile.</p>\n<p>Tim says the point is Moses arm with the staff = Yahweh\u2019s arm. Moses\u2019 physical actions become merged with Yahweh\u2019s actions. Moses is not God. Moses is an image of God. Jon says that this is really interesting because it seems that Moses is becoming conformed to the image of God, their seems to be a fusion of God and Moses. It makes Moses truly human and brings justice and life for the Israelite slaves in Egypt.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nRichard Bauckham, Jesus and the God of Israel.</p>\n<p>Show Produced By:<br />\nDan Gummel.

Tim says this theme starts in the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7). \u201cThen Yahweh said to Moses\u2026 \u201cGo to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, stand on the bank and take in your hand the staff\u2026 and say \u201cThus says Yahweh the God of the Hebrews, \u2018By this you will know that I am Yahweh, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile and it will turn to blood.\u2019 Then Moses did as Yahweh commanded\u2026 he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile.\nTim says the point is Moses arm with the staff = Yahweh\u2019s arm. Moses\u2019 physical actions become merged with Yahweh\u2019s actions. Moses is not God. Moses is an image of God. Jon says that this is really interesting because it seems that Moses is becoming conformed to the image of God, their seems to be a fusion of God and Moses. It makes Moses truly human and brings justice and life for the Israelite slaves in Egypt.\nThank you to all our supporters!\nShow Resources:\nShow Produced By:\nShow Music:\nHe\u2019s Always There - Tae the Producer\nEden - Tae the Producer\nAnother Chance - Tae the Producer\nDefender Instrumental - Rosasharn Music",

Supposing this story talks about actual divine beings as opposed to human kings, do we know for sure the author\u2019s version of the story is the same as 1 Enoch\u2019s, that the divine beings had actual sex with human girls and had actual super-human kids?\u201d</p>\n<p>(36:12) Bradley from Kentucky: \u201cA passage that's always been interesting to me is 1 Samuel 16:14, where God sends an evil spirit to torment Saul. It's connected to a passage you mentioned in 1 Kings 22, one of the only other places where this spirit type is mentioned. I was just wondering how your understanding of the Divine Council helps us understand God's sovereignty through this passage.\u201d</p>\n<p>(42:20) Jeremy from California: \u201cI'm hoping you can shed some light on Luke 10: 17-20. This is the passage where the 72 disciples return from preaching and report to Jesus that even the demons submit to them in his name. Jesus then responds by alluding to Isaiah 14 regarding the fall of the king of Babylon, but he connects it to the fall of Satan. What's going on here? Does this passage refer back to the fall of the Elohim you mentioned that takes place in the early chapters of Genesis? And does this confirm that &quot;The Satan&quot; is the chief of all of the fallen Elohim just like the king of Babylon is the chief of fallen rulers?\u201d</p>\n<p>(1:04:52) John from Houston: \u201cMy question is about the term &quot;Son of God&quot; and how that is used in the New Testament. If we look at Romans 8, we can see that we can accept adoption as sons of God in relation to the only begotten son of God, but this seems like a totally different usage of what you guys described from Genesis.

Tim begins to outline an idea to explain the origin story of the other Elohim, and it starts where everything else starts in the Bible\u2013\u2013Genesis 1.</p>\n<p>Tim explains that there is no wasted or careless word, phrase, or idea placed in the creation story. Tim zeroes in on the \u201clights\u201d created in Genesis 1 in the heavens. On day four of creation, \u201cthe great light\u201d and \u201cthe lesser light\u201d are created. Tim\u2019s point is that these lights have roles to play in creation; they are for \u201csigns and symbols.\u201d</p>\n<p>&quot;Then God said, 'Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,' and it was so. God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the night; He made the stars also. God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good. There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.&quot; \u2013 Genesis 1:14-19</p>\n<p>In part two (14:00-54:17), Tim continues to expand the analogy. His point is that in the ancient Hebrew worldview, the sun, moon, and stars were very central in their worldview. To the Hebrews, they were symbols of Yahweh\u2019s love and rule. Tim explains how this is supported in passages like Psalm 36.</p>\n<p>&quot;Your lovingkindness, O Lord, extends to the heavens,<br />\nYour faithfulness reaches to the skies.<br />\nYour righteousness is like the mountains of God;<br />\nYour judgments are like a great deep.<br />\nO Lord, You preserve man and beast.<br />\nHow precious is Your lovingkindness, O God!<br />\nAnd the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.<br />\nThey drink their fill of the abundance of Your house;<br />\nAnd You give them to drink of the river of Your delights.<br />\nFor with You is the fountain of life;<br />\nIn Your light we see light.&quot; \u2013 Psalm 36:5-9</p>\n<p>Tim says that verse 9 is important. The Hebrews believed that physical light (photons, electromagnetic, waves, etc) is a symbol, a representation of the creator behind it. Jon says he is struggling to understand this. Tim expands on the point by illustrating that in the new creation, John says, \u201cthe city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.\u201d \u2013 Revelation 21:23.</p>\n<p>Tim goes back to Genesis 1, saying that it\u2019s important to understand that God is delegating authority to the \u201clights\u201d (sun, moon, and stars) by giving them authority to rule in the heavens. Tim says only two things are given ruling ability in the creation story: humans on earth, who are God\u2019s image to rule on the earth, and the lights in the heavens, that are God\u2019s symbols to rule in the heavens. Jon remarks that he has never seen this idea in the creation story of Genesis before.</p>\n<p>Tim says that he thinks the biblical authors believed that the \u201clights in the heavens\u201d were \u201cspiritual beings,\u201d so the other Elohim would have been created and given authority when God created the \u201clights in the heavens\u201d in Genesis 1. Tim makes a distinction saying that whereas an ancient Canaanite or Egyptian would have worshiped the actual sun, moon, and stars and have heavy habits of astrology, the Hebrews would have insisted that the being to worship is the being behind it all, Yahweh. Tim makes an additional point that in Genesis 1, humans are the ultimate symbol of the divine, whereas the stars are symbols. Tim says this can be seen in Psalm 8.</p>\n<p>&quot;Lord, our Lord,<br />\nhow majestic is your name in all the earth!<br />\nYou have set your glory<br />\nin the heavens.<br />\nThrough the praise of children and infants<br />\nyou have established a stronghold against your enemies,<br />\nto silence the foe and the avenger.<br />\nWhen I consider your heavens,<br />\nthe work of your fingers,<br />\nthe moon and the stars,<br />\nwhich you have set in place,<br />\nwhat is mankind that you are mindful of them,<br />\nhuman beings that you care for them?<br />\nYou have made them a little lower than the angels<br />\nand crowned them with glory and honor.<br />\nYou made them rulers over the works of your hands;<br />\nyou put everything under their feet:<br />\nall flocks and herds,<br />\nand the animals of the wild,<br />\nthe birds in the sky,<br />\nand the fish in the sea,<br />\nall that swim the paths of the seas.<br />\nLord, our Lord,<br />\nhow majestic is your name in all the earth!&quot; \u2013 Psalm 8:1-9</p>\n<p>Tim offers Genesis 6 as a recount of the spiritual rebellion where the \u201csons of god\u201d rebel by taking human women. In Psalm 82, God confronts the Divine Council.</p>\n<p>&quot;God has taken his place in the divine council;<br />\nin the midst of the gods he holds judgment:<br />\n'How long will you judge unjustly<br />\nand show partiality to the wicked? Selah<br />\nGive justice to the weak and the fatherless;<br />\nmaintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.<br />\nRescue the weak and the needy;<br />\ndeliver them from the hand of the wicked.'<br />\nThey have neither knowledge nor understanding,<br />\nthey walk about in darkness;<br />\nall the foundations of the earth are shaken.<br />\nI said, 'You are gods,<br />\nsons of the Most High, all of you;<br />\nnevertheless, like men you shall die,<br />\nand fall like any prince.'<br />\nArise, O God, judge the earth;<br />\nfor you shall inherit all the nations!&quot; \u2013 Psalm 82:1-8</p>\n<p>Tim says this is a key passage to understand that God/Yahweh is talking to the spirit realm here, to the other Elohim. God promises that he will render his judgement on them.</p>\n<p>At 54:15, the guys transition to a mini Q+R.</p>\n<p>Here are the questions and timestamps:</p>\n<p>Q1. (54:47) Cole from North Carolina: \u201cMy question is in regard to episode 2 of the God podcast where you discuss the idea of &quot;other Elohim,&quot; and so my question is kind of two-part. 1. Are the other Elohim timeless and uncreated like God? 2. And if they aren't, does that mean that God created these inferior Elohim to oppose him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Q2. (57:33) Brandon: \u201cWhen God says, 'Let us make man in our own image and our own likeness,' who's the us' he's referring to in Genesis 1?\u201d</p>\n<p>Q3. (59:25) Ivan from El Salvador: \u201cI have a question about the deity of Christ. Tim spoke in the podcast that Christ said (that Jesus said) that he was God in a very Jewish way, and in John 8 when he said to the pharisees that before Abraham &quot;I AM.&quot; I just have one question. I was looking at your video about the word LORD in the Shema, and he says that the word was &quot;Ech Yeh,&quot; and I want to know if Jesus said that before Abraham, &quot;Ech Yeh&quot; that means that only God can say that. I've been thinking about this question. I know that it was written in Greek, but Tim said that even though it's in Greek, think in Hebrew and think in Aramaic. So when Jesus said &quot;Ech Yeh,&quot; did everyone just freak out?! Or did we lose something in translation? What do we think that Jesus said?\u201d</p>\n<p>Q4. (1:01:50) John from Colorado Springs: \u201cWhen you discussed Saul and the medium, you used her explanation of calling Samuel's spirit an Elohim as evidence that Samuel's spirit was in the same class as the rest of the gods. I've always read that as her being more surprised at seeing a spirit come to her. I'd always assumed that the author was telling us what she said, not agreeing with her declaration. Is there evidence in the text that I'm missing suggesting the fact that Samuel's spirit was indeed an Elohim and not just a case of mistaken identity by the medium? And if Samuel's spirit is in fact in the Elohim class, wouldn't that imply that there's no difference in between humans and the rest of the Elohim in the spiritual world, since we would all have some of the same Elohim within us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Q5. (1:05:12) Matt from Kansas City: \u201cYou mentioned that you do not think there is a way to put the Old Testament Divine Council vignettes into a coherent narrative, but as I was listening to your podcasts, one of your explanations sounded to me like a clear and coherent narrative. Elohim rebelled before the fall of man, and later God gave man over to his rebellion by appointing over them (Deut. 32) the Elohim that they desired. This is also consistent with the point that Paul makes in Romans 1. What do you see as the shortcomings of the harmonization?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of our supporters! Have a question?

Jon remarks that he has never seen this idea in the creation story of Genesis before.\nTim says that he thinks the biblical authors believed that the \u201clights in the heavens\u201d were \u201cspiritual beings,\u201d so the other Elohim would have been created and given authority when God created the \u201clights in the heavens\u201d in Genesis 1. Tim makes a distinction saying that whereas an ancient Canaanite or Egyptian would have worshiped the actual sun, moon, and stars and have heavy habits of astrology, the Hebrews would have insisted that the being to worship is the being behind it all, Yahweh. Tim makes an additional point that in Genesis 1, humans are the ultimate symbol of the divine, whereas the stars are symbols. Tim says this can be seen in Psalm 8.\n\"Lord, our Lord,\nTim offers Genesis 6 as a recount of the spiritual rebellion where the \u201csons of god\u201d rebel by taking human women. In Psalm 82, God confronts the Divine Council.\n\"God has taken his place in the divine council;\nTim says this is a key passage to understand that God/Yahweh is talking to the spirit realm here, to the other Elohim. God promises that he will render his judgement on them.\nAt 54:15, the guys transition to a mini Q+R.\nHere are the questions and timestamps:\nQ1. (54:47) Cole from North Carolina: \u201cMy question is in regard to episode 2 of the God podcast where you discuss the idea of \"other Elohim,\" and so my question is kind of two-part. 1. Are the other Elohim timeless and uncreated like God? 2. And if they aren't, does that mean that God created these inferior Elohim to oppose him?\u201d\nQ2. (57:33) Brandon: \u201cWhen God says, 'Let us make man in our own image and our own likeness,' who's the us' he's referring to in Genesis 1?\u201d\nQ3. (59:25) Ivan from El Salvador: \u201cI have a question about the deity of Christ. Tim spoke in the podcast that Christ said (that Jesus said) that he was God in a very Jewish way, and in John 8 when he said to the pharisees that before Abraham \"I AM.\" I just have one question. I was looking at your video about the word LORD in the Shema, and he says that the word was \"Ech Yeh,\" and I want to know if Jesus said that before Abraham, \"Ech Yeh\" that means that only God can say that. I've been thinking about this question. I know that it was written in Greek, but Tim said that even though it's in Greek, think in Hebrew and think in Aramaic. So when Jesus said \"Ech Yeh,\" did everyone just freak out?! Or did we lose something in translation? What do we think that Jesus said?\u201d\nQ4. (1:01:50) John from Colorado Springs: \u201cWhen you discussed Saul and the medium, you used her explanation of calling Samuel's spirit an Elohim as evidence that Samuel's spirit was in the same class as the rest of the gods. I've always read that as her being more surprised at seeing a spirit come to her. I'd always assumed that the author was telling us what she said, not agreeing with her declaration. Is there evidence in the text that I'm missing suggesting the fact that Samuel's spirit was indeed an Elohim and not just a case of mistaken identity by the medium? And if Samuel's spirit is in fact in the Elohim class, wouldn't that imply that there's no difference in between humans and the rest of the Elohim in the spiritual world, since we would all have some of the same Elohim within us?\u201d\nQ5. (1:05:12) Matt from Kansas City: \u201cYou mentioned that you do not think there is a way to put the Old Testament Divine Council vignettes into a coherent narrative, but as I was listening to your podcasts, one of your explanations sounded to me like a clear and coherent narrative. Elohim rebelled before the fall of man, and later God gave man over to his rebellion by appointing over them (Deut. 32) the Elohim that they desired. This is also consistent with the point that Paul makes in Romans 1. What do you see as the shortcomings of the harmonization?\u201d\nThank you to all of our supporters! Have a question? Record it and send it to info@jointhebibleproject.com. Next week, Tim and Jon will respond to questions in a full Q+R.

            "content": "<p>This is episode three in our series outlining the development of the character of God in the Bible! In this show, Tim and Jon walk through the big ideas of the \u201cDivine Council\u201d and spiritual warfare.</p>\n<p>In part one (00:00-23:40), Tim outlines a strange story in 1 Kings 22:19 about the prophet Micaiah. Micaiah said, \u201cTherefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left.&quot; Jon asks what a \u201chost\u201d is in the Bible. Tim explains that &quot;host&quot; is used to describe an army or a set of advisers. Tim says the point is that God is depicted as a military captain with a set of lower ranking officers. This theme continues in other passages like Job 1:6 and 7:6. &quot;Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the satan also came among them.&quot; &quot;The Lord said to Satan, 'From where do you come?' Then Satan answered the Lord and said, \u201cFrom roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jon asks who are the &quot;sons of God are. Tim explains that it is a turn of phrase used to represent a class of spiritual beings. Followers of Old Testament prophets were often called \u201csons,\u201d not to demonstrate physical sonship, but to demonstrate a sort of relationship where the greater power was in a position of authority over a lesser power. Tim says the point is that the Bible portrays God as having a sort of staff team, or mediators, that do his bidding in order to interact with the world. This is God\u2019s \u201cdivine council.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part two (23:40-49:48), Tim outlines a very strange section in the Old Testament: Deuteronomy 32:8-9<br />\nWhen the Most High [Yahweh] allotted the nations,<br />\nand set the divisions for the sons of humanity,<br />\nHe fixed the territories of peoples<br />\nAccording to the number of sons of God [Heb. sons of elohim]<br />\nFor Yahweh\u2019s portion is his people<br />\nJacob his own allotment.</p>\n<p>Tim says there is a large biblical scholarship debate over the interpretation of this passage. To explain this passage, Tim quotes from Jefferey Tigay:</p>\n<p>\u201cDeuteronomy 32:8-9 refers to an early tradition, that when God was allotting nations to the delegated authority of other divine beings, he made the same number of nations and territories as there were such beings. Verse 9 implies that He then assigned the other nations to those divine beings, and states explicitly that He kept Israel for Himself. This seems to be part of a concept hinted at elsewhere in the Bible and in postbiblical literature. When God organized the government of the world, He established two tiers: at the top, He Himself, \u201cGod of gods (\u02beelohei ha-\u02beelohim) and Lord of lords\u201d (Deut 10:17), who reserved Israel for Himself, to govern personally; below Him, seventy angelic \u201cdivine beings\u201d (sons of \u02beelohim), to whom He allotted the other peoples. The conception is like that of a king or emperor governing the capital or heartland of his realm personally and assigning the provinces to subordinates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jon seems flabbergasted. God put other gods in charge of other nations?<br />\nJon asks how this view can be reconciled with actual knowledge of world history and human development.</p>\n<p>Tim says this is a theme in Deuteronomy. In Deuteronomy 4:16-19, Moses says to Israel, \u201cDon\u2019t act corruptly and make a image for yourselves in the form of any figure\u2026 And don\u2019t lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, those which the Lord your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven. But the Lord has taken you...to be a people for His own possession, as today.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim says this hints at a concept in Hebrew culture that portrayed a spiritual rebellion against God that coincided with a human rebellion. Tim says the human rebellion is told in detail in the Bible, but the spiritual rebellion is only hinted at. The complex story of the \u201csons of God\u201d sleeping with human women in Genesis 6 could be viewed as them going into rebellion and crossing a line.</p>\n<p>Tim says this theme reaches its culmination in the Old Testament in the book of Daniel and the story of the Prince of Persia.</p>\n<p>In part three (49:48-1:01:26), Tim says the Jesus carries these themes of other elohim forward into the New Testament. The greek word for \u201cdemon\u201d in the New Testament is connected to the word \u201cdaimonion\u201d (\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd). Demon is a word that means \u201cdemi\u201d or lesser god. In Hebrew categories, it would be a son of elohim.</p>\n<p>Tim says he has a tough time reconciling this with a western \u201crational\u201d worldview. He says Jesus and the authors of the New Testament clearly believed in a world that included unseen spiritual forces. Tim says that the New Testament passage in Ephesians 6, referring to the &quot;armor of God,&quot; shouldn\u2019t be appropriated as passages about spiritual warfare of demonic attack; rather, they should be seen as warnings against elevating differences above unity in the body of Christ. The point of Ephesians is for the church to learn how to live in unity with a group of diverse people. Therefore a spiritual warfare attack is when Christians are not living in unity.</p>\n<p>In part four (1:01:26-1:07:18), Jon asks how to interpret all of this with a modern view of human development. Tim says the purpose of the Bible is not to tell me about the origins of the physical universe, but to be a unified story that leads to Jesus. Tim says that attempting to place spiritual and human rebellion narratives into a chronological order that makes sense to modern people can be dangerous because you lose the context of the original stories.</p>\n<p>Jon says his temptation is not that, but to think that there is no spiritual realm, not that there is a complex one ruled by a divine council. Tim agrees and says that all of the same idols that existed in other cultures exist in our culture, but modern people worship money, sex, and power, not as named deities like Mammon, but just as objects in themselves.</p>\n<p>In part five (1:07:18-end), Tim previews the next part of the \u2013 God\u2019s complex relationship with the world. If God is portrayed as having a set of staff, these staff interact with the world consistently throughout the Scriptures. One example is how the Angel of the Lord appears many times acting on behalf of God.</p>\n<p>Next episode we will have a Q+R.

This is God\u2019s \u201cdivine council.\u201d</p>\n<p>In part two (23:40-49:48), Tim outlines a very strange section in the Old Testament: Deuteronomy 32:8-9<br />\nWhen the Most High [Yahweh] allotted the nations,<br />\nand set the divisions for the sons of humanity,<br />\nHe fixed the territories of peoples<br />\nAccording to the number of sons of God [Heb. sons of elohim]<br />\nFor Yahweh\u2019s portion is his people<br />\nJacob his own allotment.</p>\n<p>Tim says there is a large biblical scholarship debate over the interpretation of this passage. To explain this passage, Tim quotes from Jefferey Tigay:</p>\n<p>\u201cDeuteronomy 32:8-9 refers to an early tradition, that when God was allotting nations to the delegated authority of other divine beings, he made the same number of nations and territories as there were such beings. Verse 9 implies that He then assigned the other nations to those divine beings, and states explicitly that He kept Israel for Himself. This seems to be part of a concept hinted at elsewhere in the Bible and in postbiblical literature. When God organized the government of the world, He established two tiers: at the top, He Himself, \u201cGod of gods (\u02beelohei ha-\u02beelohim) and Lord of lords\u201d (Deut 10:17), who reserved Israel for Himself, to govern personally; below Him, seventy angelic \u201cdivine beings\u201d (sons of \u02beelohim), to whom He allotted the other peoples. The conception is like that of a king or emperor governing the capital or heartland of his realm personally and assigning the provinces to subordinates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jon seems flabbergasted. God put other gods in charge of other nations?<br />\nJon asks how this view can be reconciled with actual knowledge of world history and human development.</p>\n<p>Tim says this is a theme in Deuteronomy. In Deuteronomy 4:16-19, Moses says to Israel, \u201cDon\u2019t act corruptly and make a image for yourselves in the form of any figure\u2026 And don\u2019t lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, those which the Lord your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven. But the Lord has taken you...to be a people for His own possession, as today.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tim says this hints at a concept in Hebrew culture that portrayed a spiritual rebellion against God that coincided with a human rebellion. Tim says the human rebellion is told in detail in the Bible, but the spiritual rebellion is only hinted at. The complex story of the \u201csons of God\u201d sleeping with human women in Genesis 6 could be viewed as them going into rebellion and crossing a line.</p>\n<p>Tim says this theme reaches its culmination in the Old Testament in the book of Daniel and the story of the Prince of Persia.</p>\n<p>In part three (49:48-1:01:26), Tim says the Jesus carries these themes of other elohim forward into the New Testament. The greek word for \u201cdemon\u201d in the New Testament is connected to the word \u201cdaimonion\u201d (\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd). Demon is a word that means \u201cdemi\u201d or lesser god. In Hebrew categories, it would be a son of elohim.</p>\n<p>Tim says he has a tough time reconciling this with a western \u201crational\u201d worldview. He says Jesus and the authors of the New Testament clearly believed in a world that included unseen spiritual forces. Tim says that the New Testament passage in Ephesians 6, referring to the &quot;armor of God,&quot; shouldn\u2019t be appropriated as passages about spiritual warfare of demonic attack; rather, they should be seen as warnings against elevating differences above unity in the body of Christ. The point of Ephesians is for the church to learn how to live in unity with a group of diverse people. Therefore a spiritual warfare attack is when Christians are not living in unity.</p>\n<p>In part four (1:01:26-1:07:18), Jon asks how to interpret all of this with a modern view of human development. Tim says the purpose of the Bible is not to tell me about the origins of the physical universe, but to be a unified story that leads to Jesus. Tim says that attempting to place spiritual and human rebellion narratives into a chronological order that makes sense to modern people can be dangerous because you lose the context of the original stories.</p>\n<p>Jon says his temptation is not that, but to think that there is no spiritual realm, not that there is a complex one ruled by a divine council.

In this show, Tim and Jon walk through the big ideas of the \u201cDivine Council\u201d and spiritual warfare.\nIn part one (00:00-23:40), Tim outlines a strange story in 1 Kings 22:19 about the prophet Micaiah. Micaiah said, \u201cTherefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left.\" Jon asks what a \u201chost\u201d is in the Bible. Tim explains that \"host\" is used to describe an army or a set of advisers. Tim says the point is that God is depicted as a military captain with a set of lower ranking officers. This theme continues in other passages like Job 1:6 and 7:6. \"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the satan also came among them.\" \"The Lord said to Satan, 'From where do you come?' Then Satan answered the Lord and said, \u201cFrom roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.\u201d\nJon asks who are the \"sons of God are. Tim explains that it is a turn of phrase used to represent a class of spiritual beings.

            "content": "<p>This is our first episode in our new series on the Bible\u2019s portrayal of God! We are currently working on a theme video about God that will be released later in 2018.</p>\n<p>In part 1, (0-8:33) Tim overviews the whole subject. He says later on in the discussion they will talk about the Trinity in the Bible, but for now, they will just focus on the development of the word God in the Bible.</p>\n<p>In part 2, (8:33-37:34) Tim outlines the problems of modern conceptions with God compared with ancient Hebrew conceptions of God. Tim says that it comes down to how people use the word \u2018God\u2019. Today people use the word \u2018God\u2019 to refer to a personal being that exists. \u2018God\u2019 is both a title for a kind of being and a name for a specific being: the Judeo Christian God.</p>\n<p>Tim says that if you look up \u201cmonotheism\u201d in the dictionary, they define it as \u201cthe belief there is only one God, specifically in Judeo Christianity.\u201d Tim asks how can this be the case if the Bible says things like \u201cLord of lords\u201d and \u201cGod of gods\u201d. How did monotheism today come to mean something that it didn\u2019t mean to the ancient Hebrews?</p>\n<p>Tim says the Hebrew word for \u201cGod\u201d is \u2018Elohim\u2019. The short forms of this word is \u201cel\u201d and also \u201celoah\u201d. Tim says that in Hebrew \u201cElohim\u201d is plural.</p>\n<p>In part 3, (37:34-54:05) Tim outlines a unique use of the word \u201cElohim\u201d the story of Saul in 1 Samuel 28:12-13: Saul has a spirit-medium conjure up the presence of the deceased Samuel: \u201cAnd the woman saw Samuel, and she cried out...and said \u2018I see a elohim rising up from the ground.\u201d<br />\nThis refers to a human who exists apart from their body. This is not saying Samuel is \u201cGod\u201d or a \u201cgod.\u201d Rather, the word elohim apparently refers to the mode of existence: a member of the non-physical, spirit realm.</p>\n<p>The later biblical authors developed vocabulary to talk about these beings to more clearly distinguish between them as elohim and the one elohim: Angel, demon, spirits, etc\u2026 The implications are Yahweh is an elohim, but not the only elohim (= spirit being).

For example, in Genesis 1, some people say Genesis 1 is poetry, some people say Genesis 1 is actual history. How can you identify if it's poetry? I know there's a lot of poetry in the Bible, and there's also a lot of narrative.\u201d</p>\n<p>(14:45) Chris from Illinois - \u201cYou talk about the metaphor of time as a possession and used it as an example of a modern metaphor, then you say that the Bible doesn't view time in this way. However, in Psalm 31:15 David says, &quot;My times are in your hand,&quot; and in Ephesians 5:16 Paul writes, &quot;We should redeem the time.&quot; Don't these phrases suggest that both David and Paul view time as figuratively, as a tangible and valuable possession?\u201d</p>\n<p>(21:55) Jackson from San Luis Obispo, California - \u201cCan you provide a short list of other commonly used metaphor schemes throughout the Scriptures?

He asks Tim why this is so different from a more familiar one of a heaven full of clouds and angels. Tim says that it\u2019s important not to mistake the image of a metaphor for the reality of what the image points to.<br />\nTim also quotes TS Eliot saying that poetry is a \u201craid on the inarticulate.\u201d In other words, poetry is meant to describe things that can\u2019t be described in normal, factual use of language.<br />\nTim begins to outline the use of the metaphor of chaotic water in the Bible. Chaotic water is the first image given in the Bible. It\u2019s meant to convey a state of un-creation, a state that is uninhabitable and unwelcoming of life. Tim begins to contrast the dark chaotic water that is present at the start of Genesis with the river of life that flows through Eden and is created later in the creation story.</p>\n<p>In part two (25:35 - 40:25), Tim explains that chaotic waters often become personified as evil. For example, in the story of the Exodus, Pharoah and his army is made equivalent to the chaotic waters in Exodus 15. This story runs in parallel with Psalm 18. &quot;O Lord God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty Lord? Your faithfulness also surrounds You. You rule the swelling of the sea; When its waves rise, You still them. You Yourself crushed Rahab like one who is slain; You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.&quot; (Rahab is a Hebrew word for Egypt).</p>\n<p>In part three (40:25 - 52:25), Tim outlines Isaiah 17:12-14.<br />\n12 Woe to the many nations that rage\u2014<br />\nthey rage like the raging sea!<br />\nWoe to the peoples who roar\u2014<br />\nthey roar like the roaring of great waters!<br />\n13 Although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters,<br />\nwhen he rebukes them they flee far away,<br />\ndriven before the wind like chaff on the hills,<br />\nlike tumbleweed before a gale.<br />\n14 In the evening, sudden terror!<br />\nBefore the morning, they are gone!<br />\nThis is the portion of those who loot us,<br />\nthe lot of those who plunder us.</p>\n<p>The metaphor of chaotic waters further expands to equate the warring nations with chaotic waters.</p>\n<p>Then Tim begins to outline the new creation prophecies and their relation to the chaotic water metaphor.</p>\n<p>Joel 4:18:<br />\n18 And in that day<br />\nThe mountains will drip with sweet wine,<br />\nAnd the hills will flow with milk,<br />\nAnd all the brooks of Judah will flow with water;<br />\nAnd a spring will go out from the house of the Lord<br />\nTo water the valley of Shittim.</p>\n<p>Zechariah 14:6-9:<br />\n6 On that day there will be neither sunlight<br />\nnor cold, frosty darkness.<br />\n7 It will be a unique day, known only to the Lord<br />\nwith no distinction between day and night.<br />\nWhen evening comes, there will be light.<br />\n8 On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem,<br />\nhalf of it east to the Dead Sea<br />\nand half of it west to the Mediterranean Sea,<br />\nin summer and in winter.<br />\n9 The Lord will be king over the whole earth.<br />\nOn that day there will be one Lord,<br />\nand his name the only name.</p>\n<p>Isaiah 2:1-4:<br />\n2 Now it will come about that In the last days<br />\nThe mountain of the house of the Lord<br />\nWill be established as the chief of the mountains,<br />\nAnd will be raised above the hills;<br />\nAnd all the nations will stream [lit. \u201criver\u201d] to it\u2026.<br />\n3 And they will hammer their swords into plowshares<br />\nand their spears into pruning hooks.<br />\nNation will not lift up sword against nation,<br />\nAnd never again will they learn war.</p>\n<p>He says that new creation means the restoration of the cosmic mountain and the reunification of the waters.</p>\n<p>In part four (52:25 - 57:35), the guys try to crystalize their thought process. Danger and death in the Bible are described as chaotic waters and love, peace and security are described as a river of life. Tim says these images are fundamental to understanding the Bible, especially the prophets.</p>\n<p>In part five (57:35 - end), the guys recap their conversation on metaphor and talk briefly about creating the video on metaphors in the Bible. Tim briefly touches on the story of Jesus walking on the water. Why is this story in all the gospels? Because in the Jewish tradition, it represents Christ\u2019s command over the chaotic waters that threaten human life and originally appear in Genesis 1.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!<br />\nNext week we will have a Poetry and Metaphor Q+R episode.

This story runs in parallel with Psalm 18. &quot;O Lord God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty Lord? Your faithfulness also surrounds You. You rule the swelling of the sea; When its waves rise, You still them. You Yourself crushed Rahab like one who is slain; You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.&quot; (Rahab is a Hebrew word for Egypt).</p>\n<p>In part three (40:25 - 52:25), Tim outlines Isaiah 17:12-14.<br />\n12 Woe to the many nations that rage\u2014<br />\nthey rage like the raging sea!<br />\nWoe to the peoples who roar\u2014<br />\nthey roar like the roaring of great waters!<br />\n13 Although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters,<br />\nwhen he rebukes them they flee far away,<br />\ndriven before the wind like chaff on the hills,<br />\nlike tumbleweed before a gale.<br />\n14 In the evening, sudden terror!<br />\nBefore the morning, they are gone!<br />\nThis is the portion of those who loot us,<br />\nthe lot of those who plunder us.</p>\n<p>The metaphor of chaotic waters further expands to equate the warring nations with chaotic waters.</p>\n<p>Then Tim begins to outline the new creation prophecies and their relation to the chaotic water metaphor.</p>\n<p>Joel 4:18:<br />\n18 And in that day<br />\nThe mountains will drip with sweet wine,<br />\nAnd the hills will flow with milk,<br />\nAnd all the brooks of Judah will flow with water;<br />\nAnd a spring will go out from the house of the Lord<br />\nTo water the valley of Shittim.</p>\n<p>Zechariah 14:6-9:<br />\n6 On that day there will be neither sunlight<br />\nnor cold, frosty darkness.<br />\n7 It will be a unique day, known only to the Lord<br />\nwith no distinction between day and night.<br />\nWhen evening comes, there will be light.<br />\n8 On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem,<br />\nhalf of it east to the Dead Sea<br />\nand half of it west to the Mediterranean Sea,<br />\nin summer and in winter.<br />\n9 The Lord will be king over the whole earth.<br />\nOn that day there will be one Lord,<br />\nand his name the only name.</p>\n<p>Isaiah 2:1-4:<br />\n2 Now it will come about that In the last days<br />\nThe mountain of the house of the Lord<br />\nWill be established as the chief of the mountains,<br />\nAnd will be raised above the hills;<br />\nAnd all the nations will stream [lit. \u201criver\u201d] to it\u2026.<br />\n3 And they will hammer their swords into plowshares<br />\nand their spears into pruning hooks.<br />\nNation will not lift up sword against nation,<br />\nAnd never again will they learn war.</p>\n<p>He says that new creation means the restoration of the cosmic mountain and the reunification of the waters.</p>\n<p>In part four (52:25 - 57:35), the guys try to crystalize their thought process.

            "content": "<p>Show Notes:</p>\n<p>In part one (00:00-08:30), Jon gives a brief recap of the conversation on biblical poetry so far. The guys summarize the first part of the conversation with the idea that reading great poetry, like the kind found in Scripture, can change you. How things are communicated in Scripture is important, and the biblical poets have a series of tools they use to connect on a deeper level with readers. To understand and fully appreciate this brilliant poetry, there are three key aspects to understand: rhythm, terseness, and parallelism.</p>\n<p>In part two (08:48-23:00), the guys break down Psalm 51, the poem David wrote after his affair with Bathsheba, and Isaiah 11. Both of these poems are tremendous examples of classic Hebrew poetry. In Psalm 51, David uses parallelism and descriptive language that communicates the fullness of his guilt and repentance. In Isaiah 11, Tim explains that the seemingly mixed metaphor of a stem and a root points to the coming Messiah, a \u201cnew David,\u201d that will come from the existing family line of Jesse. Tim then explains the well-known image of seven spirits resting on the savior. He explains that this is poetic imagery used to illustrate the seven-fold spirit of God resting on Jesus.</p>\n<p>In part three (23:01-35:34), Tim shares a quote from Adele Berlin regarding the use of creative language pairing in Hebrew poetry. This poetic principle of pairing creates an infinite number of ways to communicate creatively. For example, there are 29 times in the book of Psalms where the poet asks God to hear their prayer (example from Berlin, Dynamics of Biblical Parallelism, 127-130), and none of them are identical. Tim mentions the following examples:<br />\nPs 54:4 O God, hear my prayer // listen to the word of my mouth<br />\nPs 61:2 O God, hear my cry // pay attention to my prayer<br />\nPs 66:19 Truly God has heard // he paid attention to the sound of my prayer<br />\nPs 84:9 Yahweh, hear my prayer // listen, O God of Jacob<br />\nPs 102:2 Yahweh, hear my prayer // may my cry come to you<br />\nPs 88:3 may my prayer come before you // incline your ear to my cry<br />\nPs 88:14 to you, Yahweh, I cry out // in the morning my prayer meets you<br />\nPs 28:2 Hear the voice of my petition // when I cry out to you</p>\n<p>The guys also cover juxtaposition in film and how it relates to poetry. Tim mentions the film Baraka by Ron Fricke; the whole film is set up with juxtaposition. Jon comments that humans have an innate ability to recognize patterns, so when an author sets things up in juxtaposition, it allows a person to use their ability to search for patterns and meanings. Filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein says that the pairing of two unexpected scenes or images makes a new creation, and, like poetry, it\u2019s an abundant form of communication.

Both of these poems are tremendous examples of classic Hebrew poetry. In Psalm 51, David uses parallelism and descriptive language that communicates the fullness of his guilt and repentance. In Isaiah 11, Tim explains that the seemingly mixed metaphor of a stem and a root points to the coming Messiah, a \u201cnew David,\u201d that will come from the existing family line of Jesse. Tim then explains the well-known image of seven spirits resting on the savior. He explains that this is poetic imagery used to illustrate the seven-fold spirit of God resting on Jesus.</p>\n<p>In part three (23:01-35:34), Tim shares a quote from Adele Berlin regarding the use of creative language pairing in Hebrew poetry. This poetic principle of pairing creates an infinite number of ways to communicate creatively. For example, there are 29 times in the book of Psalms where the poet asks God to hear their prayer (example from Berlin, Dynamics of Biblical Parallelism, 127-130), and none of them are identical. Tim mentions the following examples:<br />\nPs 54:4 O God, hear my prayer // listen to the word of my mouth<br />\nPs 61:2 O God, hear my cry // pay attention to my prayer<br />\nPs 66:19 Truly God has heard // he paid attention to the sound of my prayer<br />\nPs 84:9 Yahweh, hear my prayer // listen, O God of Jacob<br />\nPs 102:2 Yahweh, hear my prayer // may my cry come to you<br />\nPs 88:3 may my prayer come before you // incline your ear to my cry<br />\nPs 88:14 to you, Yahweh, I cry out // in the morning my prayer meets you<br />\nPs 28:2 Hear the voice of my petition // when I cry out to you</p>\n<p>The guys also cover juxtaposition in film and how it relates to poetry. Tim mentions the film Baraka by Ron Fricke; the whole film is set up with juxtaposition. Jon comments that humans have an innate ability to recognize patterns, so when an author sets things up in juxtaposition, it allows a person to use their ability to search for patterns and meanings. Filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein says that the pairing of two unexpected scenes or images makes a new creation, and, like poetry, it\u2019s an abundant form of communication.

But what exactly is poetry? Tim explains that every culture has its own definition of poetry. Tim prefers this definition from Laurence Perrine: \u201cPoetry is a kind of human language that says more, and says it more intensely than does ordinary language.\u201d (Laurence Perrine, Sound and Sense: An Introduction to Poetry)</p>\n<p>In part 2 (4:43-27:00), Tim and Jon dive into Psalm 29. Tim offers the poem as a biblical meditation on a storm moving over the landscape. The guys pause on the image in verse 6 of a \u201cwild ox.\u201d This was a species now extinct called an \u201cauroch\u201d (see the show resources). Tim comments that in the Bible, the most dangerous animals are depicted as a lion or a wild ox or auroch.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (27:00-35:30), the guys discuss the use of cadence, metaphor, and meter in poetry. This varies from culture to culture. The guys note that rhyming and syllable structure allows a person to memorize the lines more easily. Additionally, Tim says that a core concept is that poetry always carries an overabundance of meaning. The limited use of words expands the meaning of them.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (35:30-54:25), Tim and Jon discuss that the ancient Israelite poetry preserved for us in the Bible doesn\u2019t fit any kind of master \u201csystem\u201d like meter (though some think so). However, the Israelites were aware of a certain kind of speech that was poetic, dense, and distinct from normal speech.

In his words:<br />\n\u201cThere is a certain conformation of the sentences, which is chiefly observable in those passages which frequently occur in Hebrew poetry, in which they treat one subject in many different ways, and dwell upon the same sentiment; when they express the same thing in different words, or different things in a similar form of words: and since this artifice of composition seldom fails to produce an agreeable and measured cadence, we can scarcely doubt it must have imparted to their poetry an exquisite degree of beauty and grace.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In part 5 (54:25-59:24), Jon asks whether or not more people should make an effort to learn to read and understand Hebrew. He says he feels discouraged. Why would God hide himself in a language that is so hard to understand and takes so much effort to learn? Tim says that every serious community of Bible followers should have someone in it who\u2019s committed to studying the scriptures in their Hebrew form.</p>\n<p>In part 6 (59:24-end), the guys continue to discuss parallelism in Hebrew poetry.<br />\nAll the Proverbs are cast in this poetic form.

But what exactly is poetry? Tim explains that every culture has its own definition of poetry. Tim prefers this definition from Laurence Perrine: \u201cPoetry is a kind of human language that says more, and says it more intensely than does ordinary language.\u201d (Laurence Perrine, Sound and Sense: An Introduction to Poetry)\nIn part 2 (4:43-27:00), Tim and Jon dive into Psalm 29. Tim offers the poem as a biblical meditation on a storm moving over the landscape. The guys pause on the image in verse 6 of a \u201cwild ox.\u201d This was a species now extinct called an \u201cauroch\u201d (see the show resources). Tim comments that in the Bible, the most dangerous animals are depicted as a lion or a wild ox or auroch.\nIn part 3 (27:00-35:30), the guys discuss the use of cadence, metaphor, and meter in poetry. This varies from culture to culture. The guys note that rhyming and syllable structure allows a person to memorize the lines more easily. Additionally, Tim says that a core concept is that poetry always carries an overabundance of meaning. The limited use of words expands the meaning of them.\nIn part 4 (35:30-54:25), Tim and Jon discuss that the ancient Israelite poetry preserved for us in the Bible doesn\u2019t fit any kind of master \u201csystem\u201d like meter (though some think so). However, the Israelites were aware of a certain kind of speech that was poetic, dense, and distinct from normal speech.

Regarding Paul\u2019s missionary journeys, Tim recounts that Paul bridged the gap between Jews and Gentiles, and Luke recounts this with all these short stories about converts like Lydia the Gentile purple merchant, Timothy the child of a Jewish mother and Greek father, the Philippian jailer, a rough and tough character, and Dionysius the Areopagite an ancient intellectual aristocrat.

Tim says this \u201czeal\u201d that Paul showed as a Pharisee is a hyperlink to an Old Testament story in Numbers 25 where the priest Phineas exercised \u201czeal\u201d to preserve the Jewish law. Jon comments that zeal is an interesting emotion that is complicated to understand in religious movements. Tim comments that Paul never lost his zeal; he just redirected it upon his conversion to Jesus.\nIn part 2 (14:00-25:30), the guys discuss Acts 13 and the missionary journeys. Tim explains that there were more missionary journeys going on than just those recounted in the book of Acts. He references a book called \u201cThe Lost History of Christianity\u201d by Philip Jenkins. Regarding Paul\u2019s missionary journeys, Tim recounts that Paul bridged the gap between Jews and Gentiles, and Luke recounts this with all these short stories about converts like Lydia the Gentile purple merchant, Timothy the child of a Jewish mother and Greek father, the Philippian jailer, a rough and tough character, and Dionysius the Areopagite an ancient intellectual aristocrat. Luke desires to portray Paul as a person who reaches a diverse group of people with the message of Jesus.\nIn part 3 (25:30-36:00), the guys discuss the circumcision controversy portrayed in Acts 15. Should Gentile converts to Christianity be required to observe traditional Jewish customs? This is one of the fundamental questions underpinning the whole New Testament, but it\u2019s largely missed today because Christianity is now majorly non Jewish. Tim says the disciples determined what to do by using a passage from the Old Testament prophet Amos found in Amos 9:11-15.\nIn part 4 (36:00-48:45), the guys discuss what ancient Rome was like and why Christianity was viewed as a threat to the Roman empire. The Roman economy was made up largely of indentured servants and slaves. Roman religion was polytheistic. Tim cites quotes by scholars Kavin Rowe and Larry Hurtado saying that Christians posed both an economic and religious threat to the Roman society. Why?\nBecause they refused to participate in communal worship of the Roman gods or in the economy built on violent nationalism. Tim says this is evident in the stories Luke shares, like the one about the silversmith Demetrius in Acts 19. He views Christianity as a threat to the entire religious and economic system of the world and incites a riot in Ephesus against Paul.\nIn part 6 (48:45-53:05), Tim shares a few quotes from NT Wright.\nIn part 7 (53:05-59:50), the guys cover Acts 17. Wherever Christianity spread, there tended to be riots as the local communities felt the Christians were disrupting their way of life. Tim says that Luke was purposefully portraying the Jesus movement on a collision course with the Roman world. Paul and other Christians would create disruption wherever they went, yet they were preaching a gospel of peace.\nIn part 8 (59:50-end), the guys make an interesting historical observation that the foundation for religious liberty and the separation of church and state comes from the ancient church fathers like Tertullian arguing for their right to worship the Jewish God, but serve a Roman emperor.\nThank you to all our supporters!\nProduced By:\nResources:\nPhilip Jenkins, Lost Christianity\nMusic:\nBeautiful Eulogy, The Fear of God\nBeautiful Eulogy, Come Alive (Hidden)\nBeautiful Eulogy, Come Alive\nMoby, Shot in the Back of the Head\nShipwrecked, Noah Dixon\nKV, Wild\nRosasharn Music, Defender Instrumental",

Acts 1 is designed to seamlessly connect with the end of the book of Luke. Tim comments that Luke has laid the plot line of the book of Acts on top of the plot of the book of Luke.

Jon asks a question about titling of ancient scrolls.\nIn part 3 (24:40-35:55) the guys discuss the question the disciples ask Jesus \u201cIs it at this time you will restore the kingdom to Israel?\u201d and Jesus answer in Acts 1:7-8 \u201c\u201cIt is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority; but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.\u201d\nWas this a dodge answer from Jesus?\nTim says no.

The key themes in these stories are chaotic waters and salvation through them.</p>\n<p>In Joshua 3, Joshua is getting ready to lead Israel across the Jordan river into the promised land. This story maps onto the story of Israel getting ready to cross the Reed/Red Sea in Exodus as they are fleeing Pharoah. Tim says this story is an example of the \u201csalvation template\u201d being used in Biblical stories.</p>\n<p>Tim gives another example of Mary\u2019s song that she sings at the birth of Jesus in Luke 1. Tim says this song is a remix of older songs in the Hebrew scriptures. Mary uses the same words, images and phrases used in other parts of the Bible to express her feelings. The guys discuss how these stories allow people to create metaphors and analogies and help people construct a worldview.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (18:10-25:21) Tim describes the famous passage in Isaiah 11 describing the stump, root, and shoot of Jesse\u2019s descendants. In this part of Isaiah, a \u201cremnant\u201d is being redeemed. Where else in the Bible does a \u201cremnant being redeemed\u201d occur? In the story of Noah and the flood. Noah and his family were the remnant. Tim says Isaiah is using this story in an analogous way to say that God will rescue his scattered nation of Israel from the \u201cchaotic waters\u201d of exile among the nations.</p>\n<p>In part 3, (25:21-32:34) the guys move to a New Testament story, The Baptism of Jesus in Mark 1. Tim and Jon uncover the similarities in this story and the foundational stories of the Old Testament. Tim asks, &quot;when looking for similarities in biblical stories, what are the controls? What should a person be looking for or be guarded against?&quot;</p>\n<p>In part 4, (32:34-50:10) the guys move further into the New Testament and discuss Pauline passages in 1 Corinthians 10. Paul describes \u201cour fathers were under the cloud and passed through the sea, and all were baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea.\u201d What does this mean and why would Paul include it?</p>\n<p>Tim says Paul is writing to a Gentile audience but views them as being directly related to ancient Jewish fathers. The Corinthians fathers are the fathers of Israel. Therefore the Jewish story of salvation is the Corinthians story as well.</p>\n<p>Tim shares another example in Romans 6. Here, Paul compares people being \u201cslaves to sin.\u201d Paul borrows language and imagery from the Exodus. Slavery of Israel, Pharoah, death, chaos, and liberation/salvation.</p>\n<p>Paul also outlines the purpose of Christian Baptism. When a Christian gets baptized, they are reenacting the salvation story, being saved \u201cthrough the waters\u201d and brought to new life on the other side.</p>\n<p>Jon ponders why all of this seems so complicated, when he thought salvation should be simple. What does it mean to be \u201csaved from chaos\u201d today?<br />\nTim offers that this perhaps means people should be willing to wrestle with the ambiguities and mysteries that these stories present. Everyone has their own slavery, their own salvation story, but the biblical stories provide templates. God conquers chaos and brings order. He sets people up in his image to do the same.</p>\n<p>In the final part (50:10 -end), Jon asks a question related to the rainbow in the flood story and the future of the world. \u201cIs God going to totally destroy the earth and start fresh? Or will God fundamentally restructure and reorder the earth? In other words, is God not going to flood the earth, or is he not going to let creation collapse back in on itself again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim points Jon to 2 Peter ch. 3 which is the biblical text Jon is thinking of. There are challenges of translation, interpretation, and also a textual variant in the ancient manuscripts of 2 Peter 3. When read closely, the text is clear that God's &quot;fire&quot; is a moral purification that will remove evil from his creation rather than completely destroy the earth itself. 2 Peter is adapting imagery from Zephaniah 3 saying that the evil will not be allowed to pass through the Day of the Lord. In the Old Testament prophets intense, fiery imagery, was not trying to predict future events by giving us \u201cvideo camera footage\u201d, but instead using provocative imagery to encourage the reader to imagine a purified creation.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!

Tim says this story is an example of the \u201csalvation template\u201d being used in Biblical stories.\nTim gives another example of Mary\u2019s song that she sings at the birth of Jesus in Luke 1. Tim says this song is a remix of older songs in the Hebrew scriptures. Mary uses the same words, images and phrases used in other parts of the Bible to express her feelings. The guys discuss how these stories allow people to create metaphors and analogies and help people construct a worldview.\nIn part 2 (18:10-25:21) Tim describes the famous passage in Isaiah 11 describing the stump, root, and shoot of Jesse\u2019s descendants. In this part of Isaiah, a \u201cremnant\u201d is being redeemed. Where else in the Bible does a \u201cremnant being redeemed\u201d occur? In the story of Noah and the flood. Noah and his family were the remnant. Tim says Isaiah is using this story in an analogous way to say that God will rescue his scattered nation of Israel from the \u201cchaotic waters\u201d of exile among the nations.\nIn part 3, (25:21-32:34) the guys move to a New Testament story, The Baptism of Jesus in Mark 1. Tim and Jon uncover the similarities in this story and the foundational stories of the Old Testament. Tim asks, \"when looking for similarities in biblical stories, what are the controls? What should a person be looking for or be guarded against?\"\nIn part 4, (32:34-50:10) the guys move further into the New Testament and discuss Pauline passages in 1 Corinthians 10. Paul describes \u201cour fathers were under the cloud and passed through the sea, and all were baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea.\u201d What does this mean and why would Paul include it?\nTim says Paul is writing to a Gentile audience but views them as being directly related to ancient Jewish fathers. The Corinthians fathers are the fathers of Israel. Therefore the Jewish story of salvation is the Corinthians story as well.\nTim shares another example in Romans 6. Here, Paul compares people being \u201cslaves to sin.\u201d Paul borrows language and imagery from the Exodus. Slavery of Israel, Pharoah, death, chaos, and liberation/salvation.\nPaul also outlines the purpose of Christian Baptism. When a Christian gets baptized, they are reenacting the salvation story, being saved \u201cthrough the waters\u201d and brought to new life on the other side.\nJon ponders why all of this seems so complicated, when he thought salvation should be simple. What does it mean to be \u201csaved from chaos\u201d today?\nIn the final part (50:10 -end), Jon asks a question related to the rainbow in the flood story and the future of the world. \u201cIs God going to totally destroy the earth and start fresh? Or will God fundamentally restructure and reorder the earth? In other words, is God not going to flood the earth, or is he not going to let creation collapse back in on itself again?\u201d\nTim points Jon to 2 Peter ch. 3 which is the biblical text Jon is thinking of. There are challenges of translation, interpretation, and also a textual variant in the ancient manuscripts of 2 Peter 3. When read closely, the text is clear that God's \"fire\" is a moral purification that will remove evil from his creation rather than completely destroy the earth itself. 2 Peter is adapting imagery from Zephaniah 3 saying that the evil will not be allowed to pass through the Day of the Lord. In the Old Testament prophets intense, fiery imagery, was not trying to predict future events by giving us \u201cvideo camera footage\u201d, but instead using provocative imagery to encourage the reader to imagine a purified creation.\nThank you to all our supporters!

            "contentSnippet": "This is another episode in our How to Read the Bible Series. Today Tim and Jon discuss literary design patterns in the Bible.\nIn part 1 (0-12:27), the guys discuss the ways Bible stories often pattern after each other. Tim explains that he is working on a project with other Bible scholars studying how many biblical stories build on each other.\nTim says many Bible stories are set up in parallel, to replay key themes the writers are trying to make. Jon provides a real life example of Toy Story 3. The Toy Story 3 writers watched dozens of prison break movies in order to write the \u201cdaycare/prison break out\u201d scene in Toy Story 3. Tim says that\u2019s a good example of a layering technique being used in modern day. The classic prison break is layered into a children\u2019s movie.\nIn part 2 (12:27-19:15), Tim says the biblical authors were very intentional about building an entire universe of meaning in the biblical stories themselves. There are thousands of hidden \u201chyperlinks\u201d of key repeated words, phrases and repeated characters that link all Bible stories together. There is no such thing as an isolated story in the Bible. An example of Bible stories linking together is David and Bathsheba and the eating of the apple in Genesis. In Hebrew, it says \u201c(Bathsheba) was good of sight, very.\u201d Tim says this links back to Adam and Eve seeing the \u201cfruit was good of sight\u201d which links back to God saying things were \u201cgood, very good.\u201d So the reader is supposed to ponder upon who decides what \u201cgood\u201d is in these stories. David? God? Adam and Eve?\nIn part 3 (19:15-26:46), the guys dive into the creation story at the beginning of the Bible. Tim says Genesis 1 is set up in a very unique way. Tim says the fundamental image of chaos is dark, untamed waters. Jon offers an interesting comment about a new shark species that was recently discovered in the dark ocean. Tim outlines the first three days as the separation of realms. (Day 1) separating light from dark, (day 2) separating water from water, (day 3) separating water from dry land. Then the next three days, 4,5,6 are the creation of inhabitants of the realms in the first three days.\nIn part 4 (26:46-35:18), Tim says, the creation account is presented in such a way that God separates the chaotic waters to create a stable habitation where humans can live. Thinking about the Biblical authors desire to layer stories on each other, Where else does this theme of God separating waters appear in the Bible?\nAll over the Bible.\nThe story of Noah is depicted as the \u201cde-creation\u201d of the world. The world sinks back into \u201cchaotic waters.\u201d God remembers Noah and causes a \u201cruach to to pass over the land\u201d just like the original creation story, he is separating the waters from the land and re-creating a habitation for humans.\nIn part 5 (35:18-end), Tim asks Jon \u201cwhat was God doing with all this separating?\u201d Jon and Tim discuss how the cause of creation descending back into chaos is human evil. Humans choose violence, bringing the world back to a place where God turns it over to chaos.\nThe next story where God tames the waters to rescue his people is the Exodus story. God \u201cremembers Israel\u201d when they cry out about their oppression in Egypt just as he \u201cremembers Noah\u201d. Tim says when Israel crosses the Red (Reed) Sea, it merges days 2 and 3 in creation. Moses splits/separates the waters to reveal dry land. Israel also passes through the waters, saved by God, just as Noah passed through the waters, saved by God.\nJon asks what\u2019s the purpose of telling stories like this is. Jon is confused, is salvation really this complicated? What does all this mean for the modern person? Tim tells Jon to be patient, and that the ultimate end of the flood and water imagery in the Bible is the Christian tradition of baptism.\nThank you to all our supporters!\nShow Resources:\nOur video on \u201cDesign Patterns in The Bible\u201d: https://thebibleproject.com/videos/design-patterns-biblical-narrative/\nShow Music:\nShow Produced By:\nDan Gummel.

Tim and Jon went on the road to do this podcast live before an audience in Milpitas, California! Tim and Jon discuss literature design patterns in the Bible and answer questions from the audience.</p>\n<p>The guys do a brief recap of the How to Read The Bible series. There are key elements to reading the Bible well. Understanding plot, character, setting and biblical narrative style. (We have videos on each of these, you can see the links below in the show notes.)</p>\n<p>In this episode, the guys combine all of these elements to talk about \u201cpatterns and design elements\u201d in the Bible. Tim and Jon use the \u201chyperlink\u201d analogy, saying that all the stories in the Bible link to each other in subtle and creative ways. People can learn to see these links and see the stories layering on top of each other by understanding key design patterns and techniques.</p>\n<p>Below are timestamps of questions and examples:</p>\n<p>(36:16) Jon asks the question, &quot;Is understanding design patterns in the Bible an \u201celite\u201d way to read the Bible?&quot; Isn\u2019t the Bible supposed to be user friendly? It seems like studying to understand the historical context of the ancient Hebrew biblical literature is a time consuming task that some people might not be able to do.</p>\n<p>(40:38) A gentleman asks a question about the city of Joppa being mentioned in both the book of Jonah and in Acts. Is this intentional and a reference to a hidden theme in the Bible?</p>\n<p>(42:25) A gentleman asks a question about the creation of stories in the Bible. What\u2019s the role of historical accuracy, retelling and condensing of events in the writing of the Bible?</p>\n<p>(49:58) A gentleman asks a question: If the Bible is a magnificent piece of timeless art and literature, How do you explain the Bible to people who value brevity and directness, not artful literature and analogy?</p>\n<p>(52:40) Tim gives an example of word plays and repetition in the Bible. The hebrew word \u201cTov\u201d means good. Tov/Good is used in the creation story as a key repeating word. It develops first to describe creation. Then it describes humans (very good). Then it describes the \u201ctree of the knowledge of good and not good/evil.\u201d This theme culminates when the woman \u201csees that the tree is good\u201d when the serpent tempts her, she has effectively switched places with God. God was the original one who \u201csaw things as good\u201d.</p>\n<p>(1:03:05) Tim gives another example in Luke. The baptism of Jesus culminates with God speaking from heaven declaring Jesus is his son. Then the next story is not a story, it\u2019s a genealogy that works its way backward to Adam being declared \u201cthe son of God\u201d. Then Jesus is tempted, with the devil asking him if he \u201creally is the son of God\u201d. Then Jesus goes to his first town and people ask \u201cWho\u2019s son is this?\u201d Then Jesus casts out a demon who declares that Jesus is \u201cthe son of God\u201d. Luke uses repetition to make a point to the reader, that Jesus is indeed who he has been declared to be, he is the Son of God.</p>\n<p>(1:07:10) Tim gives an example of the selection of Saul to be the king of Israel. The hidden word in the story is \u201csee or seeing.\u201d At the start of the story, we are told Saul is tall. This is a strange detail. Most Bible characters have no physical attributes described about them, but here, Saul is tall, which is later used as a symbol in the story. Saul looks for a \u201cseer\u201d or a \u201cprophet\u201d when searching for his father\u2019s donkeys. Why would the word \u201cseer\u201d be used in the story? Because it is a hidden key word in the story. Samuel \u201csees\u201d Saul. Samuel tells Israel to look upon Saul and \u201csee\u201d their king. Samuel and Israel \u201csee\u201d Saul and they are impressed by his height. But Saul is not a good king and God rejects him. God sends Samuel to anoint a new king. God says he has \u201cseen a new king.\u201d Samuel \u201csees\u201d Jesse\u2019s son Eliab and thinks one of these is to be the new king. But God speaks to Samuel and says \u201cGod doesn\u2019t \u2018see\u2019 as humans \u2018see\u2019, humans \u2018see\u2019 with their eyes, God \u2018sees\u2019 the heart.\u201d This line is the climax of a whole trail of breadcrumbs that started at the introduction of Saul.</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nRobert Alter: The Art Of Biblical Narrative<br />\nOur How To Read The Bible Video Series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak06MSETeo4&amp;list=PLH0Szn1yYNedn4FbBMMtOlGN-BPLQ54IH</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental - Rosasharn Music</p>\n<p>Produced By:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins, Matthew Halbert-Howen</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n",

Our Exile video is currently in production and is due out later this year (2018).</p>\n<p>We answered 6 Questions:</p>\n<p>(2:00) Austin: My question is about the lines &quot;this is my home, but not my home&quot; and the concept of the new heavens and the new earth. Now y'all have used this to make the point that we should take care of this earth because we're going to be living on it for the long-haul, but doesn't the fact that it is going to be renewed mean that no matter how good or bad of stewards we have been, God is going to make it hospitable for the long-haul, for all of eternity?</p>\n<p>(18:37) Rebecca: My question is about the 12 tribes of Israel, especially post-exile, so much of the history of Israel revolves around tribe identity. But other than Paul identifying as a Benjamite, and the temple priestess, Anna from the tribe of Asher in Luke, not much is mentioned in the NT. I just wondered, how important was tribe identity both right after the return from Exile, and if it still exists today?</p>\n<p>(27:50) Jonathan: Does the concept of exile also apply to our whole beings? Physical bodies, and consciousness. In the sense that, I am who I am, but I am not fully myself as I'm awaiting renewal.</p>\n<p>(37:45) Jonathyn: How does repentance play into the theme of Exile? In the OT, we see the prophets constantly speaking to Israel, telling them that God was communicating to them that if they repent and turn back to Him, that He would bring them back to Himself. John the B (baptist) and Jesus constantly preached repentance, and it's also all across the Apostles writings. Does exile play into this theme at all, and if so, how?</p>\n<p>(46:30) Mike: 2 Questions. 1. Could you talk about how the ideas of Exile and Return (from exile) form a foundation of understanding death and resurrection, specifically in Ezekiel's vision of the Valley of Dry Bones. 2. The Israelites are told to seek the peace &quot;Shalom&quot; of the city, during one of the least peaceful contexts, namely exile. Could you talk about how the coexistence of peace and exile affects the way in which we understand these individual concepts?</p>\n<p>(56:10) Wade: In the book of Daniel, I noticed that even King Nebuchadnezzar had a time of exile during his life, and he came out of it praising God. I had a question about Exile and sanctification. Namely, is there any time in the Bible where someone went through exile and did not come out praising God for who He is?</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!

Now y'all have used this to make the point that we should take care of this earth because we're going to be living on it for the long-haul, but doesn't the fact that it is going to be renewed mean that no matter how good or bad of stewards we have been, God is going to make it hospitable for the long-haul, for all of eternity?</p>\n<p>(18:37) Rebecca: My question is about the 12 tribes of Israel, especially post-exile, so much of the history of Israel revolves around tribe identity. But other than Paul identifying as a Benjamite, and the temple priestess, Anna from the tribe of Asher in Luke, not much is mentioned in the NT. I just wondered, how important was tribe identity both right after the return from Exile, and if it still exists today?</p>\n<p>(27:50) Jonathan: Does the concept of exile also apply to our whole beings? Physical bodies, and consciousness. In the sense that, I am who I am, but I am not fully myself as I'm awaiting renewal.</p>\n<p>(37:45) Jonathyn: How does repentance play into the theme of Exile? In the OT, we see the prophets constantly speaking to Israel, telling them that God was communicating to them that if they repent and turn back to Him, that He would bring them back to Himself. John the B (baptist) and Jesus constantly preached repentance, and it's also all across the Apostles writings. Does exile play into this theme at all, and if so, how?</p>\n<p>(46:30) Mike: 2 Questions. 1. Could you talk about how the ideas of Exile and Return (from exile) form a foundation of understanding death and resurrection, specifically in Ezekiel's vision of the Valley of Dry Bones. 2. The Israelites are told to seek the peace &quot;Shalom&quot; of the city, during one of the least peaceful contexts, namely exile. Could you talk about how the coexistence of peace and exile affects the way in which we understand these individual concepts?</p>\n<p>(56:10) Wade: In the book of Daniel, I noticed that even King Nebuchadnezzar had a time of exile during his life, and he came out of it praising God. I had a question about Exile and sanctification. Namely, is there any time in the Bible where someone went through exile and did not come out praising God for who He is?</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!

In this episode, Tim and Jon discuss the theme of Exile in the story of Jesus and the New Testament.</p>\n<p>In part 1(0-10:23), Tim outlines the historical context of Jesus\u2019 life. Israel was occupied by Rome. Rome was an oppressive military ruler who disenfranchised the Jewish people. Many Jews were waiting for a Messiah to come overthrow the Romans and restore the kingdom of Israel. When Jesus began performing miracles and declaring a new kingdom, \u201cthe kingdom of God\u201d he quickly made a name for himself. But was he the ruler the Jews were hoping for? In Matthew 22, the Jews want to test Jesus and find out if he wanted to overthrow the Romans and ask him if it's lawful to pay taxes to Rome. Jesus replies with his famous saying \u201cGive to Caesar that which is Caesar\u2019s. Give to God that which is God\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim says Jesus is the ultimate expression of the \u201cwisdom warrior\u201d that is outlined in the Old Testament books and characters like Daniel and Jeremiah. It seems the way Christians are supposed to interact with their government is one modeled after Jesus and Daniel. Be subversively loyal to your rulers. Work for the peace of your \u201cBabylon\u201d but realize there will be times when your allegiance to the kingdom of God is more important than allegiance to a country or people group.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (10:23 - 28:21), Tim and Jon discuss 1 Peter 2. Christians are supposed to \u201csubmit themselves to worldly institutions\u2026 and act like they are free.\u201d Tim and Jon briefly discuss the movie Hacksaw Ridge, a true story where a Christian joins the US Army in WWII as a medic and refuses to carry a gun because it goes against his beliefs.</p>\n<p>Tim postulates that perhaps the reason \u201cthe exile ethic\u201d in the Bible is overlooked is because many Christians in western countries have grown up with a government that has a layer of civic religion. This civic religion is usually based on Judeo-Christian teachings. But this civic religion is not a substitute for following Jesus. Tim says at the end of the day, God has chosen to redeem and form an international people, his new-covenant family, not the various kingdoms and empires that rise throughout history.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (28:21 - 34:06), Jon asks about how New Testament writers used the Garden of Eden analogy. Tim says there\u2019s no indication the writers believed humanity would return to the \u201coriginal garden.\u201d Tim cites Romans 4:13 \u201cAbraham will become an inheritor of the world.\u201d Tim says this means the original promised land of Abraham was an image of what God wants to do for the whole world. Tim and Jon discuss the difficulties of thinking in this way. Modern Christians living today are actually exiles in time, not necessarily exiles in location.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (34:06 - end), Jon and Tim discuss Hebrews 11 and the image of the \u201cnew Jerusalem\u201d in Revelation. Tim says the new Jerusalem is supposed to be the anti-Babylon image. It is a picture of humanity\u2019s civilizations working together as was originally intended. Humanity will finally no longer be in exile but will have truly returned home.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Have a question about the theme of \u201cExile in the Bible\u201d?

            "content": "<p>This is part 4 of our conversation on the biblical theme of exile. In Part 1( 0- 18:10), Tim summarizes the conversation so far. Then Tim explains that John the Baptist lived in the physical promised land of Israel, but he would quote from Isaiah when baptizing his followers because for John it was a symbolic rebooting of return from exile. Before baptism, a person was symbolically in exile. After baptism, the person has returned and entered into a new way of life.</p>\n<p>Next, Tim explains that in 1 Peter, by referring to believers as &quot;immigrants and exiles in Babylon&quot; (even though the kingdom of Babylon had ceased to exist for hundreds of years), Peter is continuing the exile metaphor as a way to think of the Christian journey as a whole.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (18:10 - 30:40) Tim explains that there\u2019s a surprising twist in the story of exile. When the Hebrews are exiled, they spread and bless the nations in a way that would not have happened had they remained centrally located. Tim outlines the books of Ezekiel and Isaiah and explains how both of those prophets used exile imagery in their own unique ways.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (30:40 - 38:35 ) Tim talks about the book of Jeremiah, Tim quotes Jeremiah 29.

In this show Tim and Jon breakdown famous Old Testament stories and how the exile theme is often an overlooked aspect of many Bible stories.</p>\n<p>In part 1 (0-10:27), Tim begins in Genesis 1 and 2, explaining that Eden is depicted as a \u201ccosmic mountain\u201d. This is in reference to other ancient religions that believed their gods lived on mountains. For example, the Greeks believed in their storytelling that the gods lived on Mt Olympus. The Canaanites believed their gods lived on Mt Zaphon. The Hebrews believed in Mt Zion. (See Psalm 48:2 \u201cBeautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth, like the heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the Great King.\u201d )<br />\nTim\u2019s point is that the writers of Genesis 1 and 2 placed Eden and Zion as their idea of paradise which directly competed with their pagan neighbors religious ideas.</p>\n<p>In part 2 (10:27-29:15), Tim outlines the depiction of peace in the garden. There is peace with the created order, depicted as the fruit being abundant and easy to harvest. There is peace with animals and nature, depicted as man naming animals. Tim explains that in Isaiah 11, part of the vision of the new creation is when humans and animals will live at peace with each other. (A baby playing with a snake.)</p>\n<p>Tim outlines the history behind the two trees placed in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. After Adam and Eve eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, they are banished to the East of the garden. Tim says this is the first use of exile language in the Bible. They are exiled to the East, which is later the direction where Babylon is placed. Then in the next story, Cain is also banished/exiled to the East after he kills his brother Able. In Genesis 11, all of humanity is depicted as migrating to the East, and then scattered from there.</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s point is that the biblical authors are intentionally developing a theme that humanity is banished/exiled to the East. Tim quotes from Joseph Blenkinsopp saying that biblical authors intentionally placed humanity\u2019s story of fall from the paradise of Eden as a foreshadowing of the coming fall of Israel.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (29:15-36:56), Tim outlines the story of Abraham. Tim says Abraham is a wandering nomad originally from the geographical area of Babylon. Abraham is called and given a promise of his own land for him and his descendants.</p>\n<p>Tim explains that Abraham only owns one plot of land in the Bible when his wife Sarah dies and he buys a burial plot. Abraham refuses to be gifted the land and buys it outright. In the story, Abraham uses the phrase \u201cI am a stranger and sojourner in this land among you.\u201d That phrase is adopted in Psalm 31 and 1 Peter to describe the human experience of living in exile. The story of Abraham becomes an archetype that other biblical authors use to say that humanity is rightful home, meaning we are supposed to live on the earth, but it is not in its promised state of existence.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (36:56-end), Tim outlines the story of the journey of the nation of Israel. Israel inherited Abraham\u2019s promise. But they chose to disobey God and not cross over the Jordan into the promised land. As a result, God exiled them to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.</p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<p>Joseph Blenkinsopp - Exile</p>\n<p>Show Music:</p>\n<p>Take Off With Me: JGivens<br />\nSo Fly: JGivens<br />\nFaherenheit 99: JGivens<br />\nDefender Instrumental: Rosasharn Music</p>\n<p>Produced by:</p>\n<p>Dan Gummel.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "This is our third episode discussing the Biblical theme of exile. In this show Tim and Jon breakdown famous Old Testament stories and how the exile theme is often an overlooked aspect of many Bible stories.\nIn part 1 (0-10:27), Tim begins in Genesis 1 and 2, explaining that Eden is depicted as a \u201ccosmic mountain\u201d. This is in reference to other ancient religions that believed their gods lived on mountains. For example, the Greeks believed in their storytelling that the gods lived on Mt Olympus. The Canaanites believed their gods lived on Mt Zaphon. The Hebrews believed in Mt Zion. (See Psalm 48:2 \u201cBeautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth, like the heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the Great King.\u201d )\nIn part 2 (10:27-29:15), Tim outlines the depiction of peace in the garden. There is peace with the created order, depicted as the fruit being abundant and easy to harvest. There is peace with animals and nature, depicted as man naming animals. Tim explains that in Isaiah 11, part of the vision of the new creation is when humans and animals will live at peace with each other. (A baby playing with a snake.)\nTim outlines the history behind the two trees placed in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. After Adam and Eve eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, they are banished to the East of the garden. Tim says this is the first use of exile language in the Bible. They are exiled to the East, which is later the direction where Babylon is placed. Then in the next story, Cain is also banished/exiled to the East after he kills his brother Able. In Genesis 11, all of humanity is depicted as migrating to the East, and then scattered from there.\nTim\u2019s point is that the biblical authors are intentionally developing a theme that humanity is banished/exiled to the East. Tim quotes from Joseph Blenkinsopp saying that biblical authors intentionally placed humanity\u2019s story of fall from the paradise of Eden as a foreshadowing of the coming fall of Israel.\nIn part 3 (29:15-36:56), Tim outlines the story of Abraham. Tim says Abraham is a wandering nomad originally from the geographical area of Babylon. Abraham is called and given a promise of his own land for him and his descendants.\nTim explains that Abraham only owns one plot of land in the Bible when his wife Sarah dies and he buys a burial plot. Abraham refuses to be gifted the land and buys it outright. In the story, Abraham uses the phrase \u201cI am a stranger and sojourner in this land among you.\u201d That phrase is adopted in Psalm 31 and 1 Peter to describe the human experience of living in exile. The story of Abraham becomes an archetype that other biblical authors use to say that humanity is rightful home, meaning we are supposed to live on the earth, but it is not in its promised state of existence.\nIn part 4 (36:56-end), Tim outlines the story of the journey of the nation of Israel. Israel inherited Abraham\u2019s promise. But they chose to disobey God and not cross over the Jordan into the promised land.

Peter chooses to address the people in the letter as \u201cimmigrants and exiles.\u201d Peter chooses to identify Christians as exiles in a world that is waiting to be redeemed.

Characters in Bible stories are described and portrayed very differently compared to characters in modern stories.<br />\nIn this episode Tim and Jon discuss character design in the Bible.</p>\n<p>The guys start out (0-9:50) showing how our modern tradition of telling every detail about a character in a story, where they are from, what they look like, what their inner thoughts are, comes from Greek story telling tradition.  This is the exact opposite of ancient Jewish storytelling.  The biblical authors didn\u2019t rely on telling you about a character, instead, they would tell you what they did.  The characters themselves remain very mysterious.   Tim says this lack of detail is done intentionally so the reader has to work for an interpretation.</p>\n<p>In the second part of the episode (9:50-21:13), Tim explains the two ways biblical authors use character details.  One, a narrator will use \u201cdirect characterization.\u201d  A specific detail will be given because it is useful in the story.  We are told Saul is tall because later, we find out that David is short.   We are told Joseph is handsome because later, Potiphar\u2019s wife attempts to seduce him.  Jon asks if this technique is used because the of the constraints of passing stories on pre printing press.<br />\nThe second way is the names of characters.  In Hebrew literature, a character\u2019s name represents the very essence of their being and shows their role in the story.  Saul means \u201cThe one who was asked for\u201d  because Israel asked him to be king.   The two sons of Naomi in the book of Ruth, their names are Mahlon and Chilion mean \u201cone who is sick\u201d and \u201cto die\u201d.  Their only role in the story is to die and set up the plot conflict.</p>\n<p>In the third part of the episode, (21:13-25:56)  Tim explains that just because a character does something in a story, doesn\u2019t mean the author is endorsing the action.  Many authors use a minimalist technique of telling the reader the character\u2019s choices but not saying why the character made these choices.  A famous is example is when Moses kills the Egyptian who was beating the Hebrew.   We don\u2019t know why Moses killed him, we only know that he did.   Biblical narrators refuse to tell us if a character is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d instead they let us decide for ourselves.</p>\n<p>In the fourth part of the episode (25:56-end) Jon asks why.  Why would biblical authors take the risk of their work being misinterpreted?    Tim says the Biblical authors want readers to puzzle over the ambiguities of their stories because it is meant to represent the ambiguities that are inherent in life.  The big narrative of the Bible puts meaning and purpose in the world, but individual stories are meant to create a feeling of opaqueness and mystery.</p>\n<p>More Bible Project resources are here on the website: thebibleproject.com<br />\nWatch the accompanying video to this content here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EQDGax19xk</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Show Resources:</p>\n<p>Shimon Bar-Efrat, \u200bNarrative Art in the Bible\u200b<br />\nAdele Berlin, \u200bPoetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative\u200b<br />\nMeir Sternberg, \u200bThe Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading\u200b<br />\nRobert Alter, \u200bThe Art of Biblical Narrative\u200b<br />\nYairah Amit, \u200bReading Biblical Narrative<br />\nCormac McCarthy, \u200bThe Road\u200b and \u200bThe Border Trilogy: \u200b(1) All the Pretty Horses, \u200b(2) The Crossing, \u200b(3) Cities of the Plain.</p>\n<p>Music Credits:</p>\n<p>Defender Instrumental: Rosasharn Music<br />\nEducated Fool:  Jackie Hill Perry<br />\nRuby: CJBeards<br />\nFlooded Meadows: Unwritten Stories</p>\n<p>Produced By:</p>\n<p>Dan Gummel.

Tim and Jon discuss.\nIn the first part of the episode (0-12:30), Tim and Jon outline where the word \u201csoul\u201d comes from (Old English), and why most people think that a core teaching of the Bible is people \u201chaving souls.\u201d  Jon asks how much you can really separate the ideas of a person\u2019s \u201cmind, soul, and body.\u201d\nIn the second part of the episode (12:30-41:20), Tim explains that the Hebrew word \u201cNephesh\u201d is an extremely common word in the Hebrew Old Testament.  It occurs over 700 times, but less than 10% of the time is it translated as \u201csoul.\u201d   It also gets translated as \u201clife\u201d, \u201cheart\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d, \u201cpeople\u201d and several other words.\nTim explains that the word Nephesh is designed to show the essential physicality of a person.  Whereas \u201csoul\u201d connotes the non-physicality of a person.\nIn the third part of the episode (41:20-end), Tim says \u201cNephesh\u201d isn\u2019t just used to describe humans, but also used to describe animals and what the land produced in Genesis.  \u201cAnd God said \u2018Let the waters teem with living Nephesh.\u2019\u201d\nThe bottom line, biblically, is that people don\u2019t have souls.  They are souls.  They don\u2019t have \u201cnephesh\u201d they are \u201cnephesh.\u201d  And the ultimate hope for Christians is not a disembodied existence living as souls, but an embodied existence living in their Nephesh.\nYou can check out our new word studies video on Nephesh here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_igCcWAMAM\nThank you to all our supporters!

In other words, why aren\u2019t things a little more rad in our day to day?\nThe ancient Hebrew authors of the Bible also wrestled with these questions.  They often used the word \u201choliness\u201d to describe the quest for the ideal life.    But today \u201choliness\u201d is a confusing and loaded word.  Spoiler alert:  The way the Hebrews understood holiness is not how we do in modern times.\nTim, Jon, and a special guest, Paul Pastor hold an honest discussion asking why we all strive for something that seems just out of reach, and what that might have to do with God\u2019s holiness.\nThank you to all our supporters!

God\u2019s commitment is to dismantle human empires that rise to power and redefine good and evil, even if that means that God will have to defeat his own chosen nation. The story picks up with King Solomon in ancient Israel. He is considered to be one of the richest and wisest men who ever lived. But as Tim and Jon discuss, things aren't always as they seem.\nIn the first part of the episode (02:25-23:42), the guys unpack the rise and fall of King Solomon. Solomon had a great beginning and good intentions as Israel\u2019s king, but he got caught up in power and no longer thought of himself as under the authority of God. The story of Solomon is about the oppressed becoming the oppressors, and to the ancient prophets, Solomon's downfall is viewed as a \"Day of the Lord.\"\nIn the next part of the episode (24:07-1:01:46), the guys look at how leaders like Pharaoh and Solomon are made. Solomon is a prime example of how even good intentions can become corrupted. The guys wrap up this episode by setting the stage for the Roman empire and Christ's coming to earth.\nVideo:\nReferences:\nShow Music:\nDefender Instrumental by Rosasharn Music\nReady to Make Way by Greyflood",

We try to look inside the biblical writers\u2019 imaginations and think about what they were trying to picture when they used certain words.</p>\n<p>The Bible was originally written in Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic.   For thousands of years its been passed down through translators.   And sometimes the words that we read today in our Bibles don\u2019t fit with the context the authors were originally using.

            "content": "<p>In this episode, Tim and Jon continue to unpack the concept of the Holy Spirit. Last time, they focused on the spirit of God. This time, they\u2019ll look at what the word spirit means and the difference between God\u2019s spirit and human spirit. Scripture is full of examples of God\u2019s spirit influencing and empowering people, but is this really still happening? What does the spirit of God have to do with us today as followers of Jesus, and how will God use his spirit and use people to fulfill his purpose for creation?</p>\n<p>In the first part of this episode (01:33-18:36), the guys look at the Hebrew word for spirit, \u201cruakh.\u201d They track the ruakh of God throughout Scripture, so that we can begin to understand the purpose of God\u2019s spirit. They also talk about what it means for humans to have a spirit.</p>\n<p>In the next part of the episode (19:00-40:43), Tim and Jon break down the four different definitions of ruakh. They look at the way God\u2019s spirit empowers people in Scripture, working with their human spirit to accomplish God\u2019s will in the world. God uses some pretty bad guys in the Bible, but understanding the different aspects of God\u2019s ruach can help make this a little more clear.</p>\n<p>In the final part of the episode (41:26-51:38), Tim and Jon look at the Hebrew prophets and the way they spoke about the ruach of God. God\u2019s ruach and the new creation are directly connected. The Messiah is described as one who will be fully permeated by the ruach of God, and his coming will completely change the way creation operates. The prophets reiterate what so much of the Hebrew Scriptures are pointing to: The only hope for creation and humanity is for God to recreate humans through his spirit.</p>\n<p>Video:<br />\nThis episode is designed to accompany our video, &quot;Holy Spirit.&quot; You can view it on our youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNNZO9i1Gjc</p>\n<p>Scripture References:<br />\nPsalm 33<br />\nPsalm 51<br />\nGenesis 41<br />\nExodus 31<br />\nDeuteronomy 34<br />\nMicah 3<br />\nIsaiah 11<br />\nEzekiel 37</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental by Rosasharn Music<br />\nBlue Skies by Unwritten Stories<br />\nFlooded Meadows by Unwritten Stories</p>\n",

He comes into the story and reaffirms for Job that God is just, but he also hints at a more complex understanding of God\u2019s justice. Yes, he is just, but he\u2019s also God, and he\u2019s capable of disciplining someone to avoid future suffering.\nIn the second part of the episode (07:51-17:22), the guys discuss Job\u2019s speech in Chapter 28.

Job is considered wisdom literature, and it aims to teach the reader about justice, suffering, and the role of God in the lives of humans. The author is intentionally trying to ruffle some feathers. This book is all about calling into question the reader\u2019s views of God and the world.\nIn the first part of the episode (02:15-09:02), Tim and Jon give an overview of Job and talk about what it\u2019s trying to communicate. The book doesn\u2019t give us a clear answer as to why Job is suffering, but it does teach us about the character of God and offers a model for how to handle suffering.\nIn the next part of the episode (13:34-23:03), the guys talk about the order that humans try to impose on the world. This is a major theme in the book of Job. This is a book where we see things happening that don\u2019t fit our category of order, but God has wisdom and a way of ordering the world that is beyond our understanding.\nNext (23:34-34:24), the guys talk about how Job comes to understand God\u2019s divine wisdom and judgement. In Job, we see that the world can\u2019t be run by a system, it has to be run by God\u2019s judgement.\nIn the next part of the episode (34:53-46:34), the guys talk about some of the overarching themes in Job that connect to the larger narrative of Scripture.

            "content": "<p>Hanging out with Ecclesiastes isn\u2019t fun. We need to be exposed to the Teacher\u2019s words as a helpful exercise to have our illusions dismantled. His words are like a Goad (a pointy stick to get Sheep to go in the right direction). The endless march of time that results in death for everyone. Everything dies. Humans and Animals. From our point of view (under the sun) humans don\u2019t seem to be any better than animals. We can see that all living creatures go to the dirt and we don\u2019t have any concrete proof of what happens after that. We can\u2019t prove that humans have any advantage over the animals. As a follower of Jesus we have a worldview based on the claim of the Apostles that Jesus raised from the dead so we see this differently than the Teacher in Ecclesiastes.</p>\n<p><strong>Music Break</strong></p>\n<p>More on the March of Time and death from a cosmic scale.</p>\n<p>Ecclesiastes has a whole poem about aging. We are all going towards old age and old age is miserable.</p>\n<p>Ecclesiastes also talks about chance. Life is unpredictable. Chance screws with all of us. You can\u2019t guarantee that when you do the right thing it will work out.</p>\n<p>Death, Time and Chance</p>\n<p><strong>Music Break</strong></p>\n<p>The Teacher, surprisingly, still wants us to be wise. The Teacher realizes that being wise is the right thing to do. There are no guarantees but better odds.</p>\n<p>What does it mean to be overly righteous and overly wise?</p>\n<p>It is good to be righteous and strive to live an upright moral life. But when that is your sole focus and mindset and you believe you deserve things you have the wrong perspective.</p>\n<p>The one who Fears God will avoid all extremes.</p>\n<p>Being overly righteous will destroy you. There is so much good to be done in the world if you try to do it all you will destroy yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Music Break</strong></p>\n<p>What are we suppose to do with all of this: Death, March of Time, Chance, Be Wise but no guarantees. Acknowledging all of this isn\u2019t becoming an atheist or agnostic but it is the secret to enjoying life.</p>\n<p>Come to terms with your inability to control all your life circumstances. This mindset is the silver bullet for enjoying your life.</p>\n<p>Blaze Pascal<br />\n&quot;We do not rest satisfied with the present. We anticipate the future as too slow in coming, as if in order to hasten its course; or we recall the past, to stop its too rapid flight. So imprudent are we that we wander in the times which are not ours and do not think of the only one which belongs to us; and so idle are we that we dream of those times which are no more and thoughtlessly overlook that which alone exists.</p>\n<p>For the present is generally painful to us. We conceal it from our sight, because it troubles us; and, if it be delightful to us, we regret to see it pass away. We try to sustain it by the future and think of arranging matters which are not in our power, for a time which we have no certainty of reaching.</p>\n<p>Let each one examine his thoughts, and he will find them all occupied with the past and the future. We scarcely ever think of the present; and if we think of it, it is only to take light from it to arrange the future. The present is never our end. The past and the present are our means; the future alone is our end.</p>\n<p>So we never live, but we hope to live; and, as we are always preparing to be happy, it is inevitable we should never be so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remember to live.</p>\n<p><strong>Music Break</strong></p>\n<p>Life is full of things that are out of your control and don\u2019t always make sense.

Hevel technically means smoke or vapor, but it is also used metaphorically to mean absurd or an enigma.\nIn the next part of the episode (17:51-34:46), the guys talk about the way Ecclesiastes stands out among the other books in the Old Testament. Is this book scandalous among the Jewish Scriptures?\nIn the final part of the episode (35:09-51:20), the guys unpack the concept of the \u201cgood life\u201d that Ecclesiastes is teaching about. What does it mean to live a good life? What are our motives for pursuing the good life if there is so much hevel?\nVideo:\nScripture References:\nShow Music:\nDefender Instrumental by Rosasharn Music\nBlue Skies by Unwritten Stories\nFlooded Meadows by Unwritten Stories",

But it\u2019s not just about using wisdom to know the pattern of the universe; we can use it to design our life.</p>\n<p>In the next part of the episode (10:25-22:00), the guys talk about chokmah as more than an impersonal force. The wisdom found in Proverbs is not just about goodness and reality, it\u2019s also about street smarts. This is the second nuance of chokmah.

Scripture tells us that humans are made in the image of God, but what does that actually mean for our lives? Do we exist simply to glorify God, or does bearing the image of God mean we have a greater responsibility? As Christians, we tend to think we have to divide secular and sacred, but as the guys will unpack, this doesn\u2019t have to be the case and we can choose to reflect God and his image in all that we do.</p>\n<p>In the first part of the episode (01:15-04:48), Tim and Jon talk about why the garden shouldn\u2019t be considered perfection. The garden was good, but it is only the beginning of the story! God\u2019s story will be complete when humans are fully united to God and his creation is redeemed.</p>\n<p>In the next part of the episode (05:15-16:58), the guys talk about the parent/child relationship between God and humans. It\u2019s crucial to understand that God wants to share his creation with us! Just like in the garden, humans will one day reign with God.</p>\n<p>The Westminster Confession of Faith is a well-known confession of the church of England. You may be familiar with it: \u201cMan's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.\u201d In the next part of the episode (17:19-35:16), the guys unpack this a little bit and point out the problems with taking this bystander approach to humanity\u2019s purpose on earth. Glorifying and enjoying God is only a small part of bearing the image of God.</p>\n<p>So what does it mean for humans to bear the image of God? In the last part of this episode (35:45-1:07:14), the guys will talk about the implications of the image of God for followers of Jesus. We\u2019re not simply a representation of God, we get to work with him to bring about his purpose on earth! But we have to realize that we are image bearers who don\u2019t always represent God well.

Humans are sinful, sure, but they\u2019re also treasured by God and a crucial part of his plan for humanity. The biblical story is not about how terrible people are. It\u2019s about God\u2019s plan for the world and how he will restore and heal the image of God in humans and fulfill the original calling he gave in the garden.</p>\n<p>In the second part of the episode (06:19-12:10), Tim and Jon talk about God\u2019s plan for humans to reign on his behalf as the image is repaired. Paul picks up the language of the image of God to talk about Jesus and the process of becoming new humans and being renewed according to the image of God.</p>\n<p>In the next part of the episode (12:29-19:24), the guys discuss what our divine purpose is as humans.

There is a familiar narrative that the garden was perfect and then humans came in and ruined everything, but as Tim will point out, it\u2019s more complex than that. The garden was only the beginning; it had potential for perfection, but it wasn\u2019t God\u2019s plan for creation fully realized\u2013\u2013not yet. Genesis is not the end of the story.

This is the first time \u201cheaven&quot; appears in the Bible. \u201cThe heavens\u201d literally means \u201cthe sky.\u201d Did the ancient Israelites think God lived in the sky? Maybe. The guys will talk more about this and what it means for God\u2019s space and human space to overlap.</p>\n<p>In the first part of the episode (01:27-08:57), the guys talk about the idea that heaven is in the clouds. How did we get there? Tim will break down the Hebrew word for heaven and explain a bit more about what the ancient Israelites believed about God\u2019s heavenly space.</p>\n<p>In the second part of the episode (09:17-18:59), the guys will talk about the significance of temples for the ancient Israelites.

The guys talk about what it will be like for God\u2019s Kingdom to be fully realized. The Bible tells us that God\u2019s Kingdom arrived in Jesus, but the fullness of that Kingdom is yet to come. What went wrong with the establishment of God\u2019s Kingdom, and how does he plan to fix it?\nIn the first part of the episode (01:22-13:20), Tim and Jon talk about Jesus as the one who has authority over heaven and earth. What does this mean exactly, and how are humans invited into this with Jesus?\nIn the next part of the episode (13:40-17:29), the guys talk about the New Jerusalem that\u2019s introduced in Revelation 22:1-5. This is a key passage in understanding how humans will serve and reign with Jesus in God\u2019s Kingdom.\nIn the next part of the episode (18:02-23:22), the guys look at how God responds to humans setting up their own kingdoms. In the book of Genesis, we see that humans keep getting in the way of God\u2019s plan. God\u2019s covenant promise with Abraham and the children of Israel was all about trying to correct what went wrong with God establishing his Kingdom on earth.\nVideo:\nScripture References:\nShow Music:\nDefender Instrumental by Rosasharn Music\nBlue Skies by Unwritten Stories\nFlooded Meadows by Unwritten Stories",

As Jesus followers, we have to wrestle with what this means for us.\nIn the first part of the episode (00:56-12:18), the guys talk about Jeremiah and Ezekiel\u2019s response to Israel\u2019s disobedience. They warned of consequences to rebellion, but their primary message was the radical heart change that needed to take place.\nIn the next part of the episode (12:33-21:30), Tim and Jon talk about Jesus challenging the common interpretations of the law in the Gospels. He boiled down all of God\u2019s commands to the great command: love God and love people. Jesus wasn\u2019t focused on the letter of the law, but the heart behind it. The religious leaders of the day had becoming totally wrapped up in legalism and had lost sight of the purpose behind the laws.\nIn the next part of the episode (21:46-33:57), the guys discuss the central debate of the New Testament: should Jesus followers have to follow the commands even if they aren\u2019t Jewish? The apostles were divided on this, and it\u2019s a question that Paul comes back to throughout his letters.\nIn the final part of the episode (34:12-50:05), the guys wrap things up with a discussion on what the law should mean for Jesus followers today. Though these laws likely won\u2019t affect our day-to-day lives, there is profound wisdom to be gained, especially when we understand God\u2019s purpose for giving them. When we look at the context the laws were given in, we can see God\u2019s heart for his people and his creation.\nVideo:\nScripture References:\nShow Music:\nDefender Instrumental by Rosasharn Music\nBlue Skies by Unwritten Stories\nFlooded Meadows by Unwritten Stories",
