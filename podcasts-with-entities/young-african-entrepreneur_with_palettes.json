Born in a rural village in KwaZulu-Natal, Dr. Lulu came from a large family that included 25 family members. Growing up, she wanted to be a doctor, but there was no math teacher in her village, which halted her future medical career. She studied at University of Fort Hare, a historically important black university. Encouraged by a professor, Dr. Lulu completed her masters in urban planning at the University of Natal, a predominantly white higher education institution where she was one of a handful of black students. She qualified as the first black town and regional planner \u2013 a remarkable achievement in apartheid South Africa. In the late 1980s, Dr. Lulu left for London for further graduate studies; she graduated from the London School of Economics with a masters in social policy &amp; planning and the University College London with a PhD. With the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994, South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime was no more. Dr. Lulu joined the government as a director in the national department of public works. For the next ten years, she worked in development, consulting, and research, notably for the World Bank. In the early 2000s, Dr. Lulu parlayed her diverse professional experiences into business. She set up Lereko Investments with partners and quickly established herself as a power player in South Africa\u2019s corporate world. She\u2019s also a non-executive director at FirstRand, Massmart, and Sun International. Dr. Lulu has built an extraordinary career. She\u2019s achieved many firsts, academically and professionally. I was inspired by her story, which is a testament to her grit and spirit. Without further ado, here\u2019s my conversation with Dr Lulu Gwagwa.</p>\n",

You can connect with him @yegomotoafrica on Twitter. Karan is a successful entrepreneur who grew flourishing businesses in both India and Singapore. In 2015, he travelled to Rwanda on business and saw an opportunity to use tech to organize the informal motorcycle taxi sector, which is prone to road accidents and associated with theft and crime. The Rwandan government had even banned, albeit briefly, motorcycle taxis from Kigali around this time, but as the main means of transportation, they had to let them back onto the streets. He set up Yegomoto which mounts a IOT-enabled device with a point of sales terminal onto all of its bikes, which helps drivers, who are earning better wages and avoiding deadly accidents, and riders, who no longer have to haggle for fares and are safer. And the exciting part of Yegomoto\u2019s business model is that it can use the reams of data on its bikes, including the speed, location, fare costs, for other businesses. In fact, Karan, who is quite the ambitious and forward-thinking entrepreneur, doesn\u2019t see Yegomoto as just a platform play but rather an infrastructure play, which he explains in fascinating detail. We talked about Karan\u2019s long-term vision for Yegomoto, why it\u2019s different from other ride-hailing apps like Taxify and Uber, and the four questions he asks every aspiring entrepreneur.

                "summary": "Mira Mehta is the founder and CEO of Tomato Jos, a tomato paste company based in Kaduna, Nigeria. You can connect with her @ShoutsAndMiras and @TeamTomatoJos on Twitter. Mira was born and raised in New England in the US. Fresh out of college, she landed her first job at BlackRock, a large asset manager. Driven and ambitious, Mira quickly realized that she\u2019d never have a leadership role, as her department was just a \u201cline item\u201d in the company\u2019s P&amp;L. She was looking to make more of an impact and joined the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which sent her to Nigeria. While she was once driving to Kano in northern Nigeria, Mira saw a glut of tomatoes lining the side of the road. The quantity of rotting tomatoes was so great that the road resembled a red carpet. The image lingered with her. Why was Nigeria, which imports hundreds of millions of dollars of tomato paste per year, not able to manufacture tomato paste locally from its domestic tomato crop? After finishing her MBA at Harvard, Mira still couldn\u2019t shake the tomato processing idea, and she decided to bite the bullet. In 2014, Mira moved to Nigeria to set up her tomato processing company, Tomato Jos. Mira talks candidly about the difficulties and challenges inherent to Nigeria\u2019s agroprocessing sector, why profitable farming is the key to any successful processing project (and explains why Dangote\u2019s tomato paste factory rests idle), the ins and outs of her outgrower program, and how she works with her investors. Plus, Mira gave one of the most thought-provoking answers to one of my favorite questions about where she\u2019d travel in Sub-Saharan Africa to improve her business --- so don\u2019t miss her response. Without further ado, here\u2019s my conversation with Mira Mehta."

Originally from Germany, Manuel started his career as a consultant for Boston Consulting Group (BCG). During an assignment in South Africa, he fell in love with Cape Town. Looking to relocate there permanently, he left BCG and co-founded Zando, South Africa\u2019s e-commerce fast fashion platform. After he stopped running the day-to-day operations at Zando, he helped to co-found Jumia Nigeria. In 2013, Manuel set up Silvertree Holdings, a holding company that invests and develops South African startups. Manuel was disenchanted with the large-scale, heavily capitalized, and massive valuation startup model that was epitomized by Jumia. He wanted to take a radically different approach to his investment model that provided patient capital and resources and mentorship to startup founders. We chatted about Manuel\u2019s early days at Zando, his involvement with Jumia Nigeria, and why the Silicon Valley model isn\u2019t a good fit for African startups. Without further ado, here\u2019s my conversation with Manuel Koser."

You can connect with her @dasexlady on Facebook and @slidesafeng on Twitter and Instagram. You can also find her on LinkedIn @Florida Uzoaru. Despite coming from a commercially minded Nigerian family, Florida grew up hating sales. For her, it was like begging. In her 20s, she entered the public health profession and became passionate about promoting safe sex in Nigeria. While Nigeria has one of the world\u2019 highest rates of HIV infection, only 10% of the population actually gets tested. Frustrated with the approach of NGOs, which failed to tackle the problem on the ground, she came up with the idea for Slide Safe \u2013an online service that delivers self-testing kits for HIV, hepatitis B, and other sexually transmitted infections as well as contraceptives. But, she was reluctant to publicly promote her business. She thought she could be a behind-the-scene founder. After all, she grew up hating sales. But, she finally told herself to \u201cstop running away\u201d from taking on a public role as founder of Slide Safe. Since then, Florida has become a fierce and vocal advocate of her business and adopting safe sex practices in Nigeria. Florida speaks candidly about her many pivots during her entrepreneurial journey as well as the difficulties she faced while refining the messaging of Slide Safe. (Its original name was Sex in a Box but that didn\u2019t go down well in conservative Nigeria.) She also talks about her experiences at the CC Hub and Tony Elumelu accelerator programs, the nuanced challenges of being a female entrepreneur, and why subscription services just don\u2019t work in Nigeria.

You can connect with him @henrinyakarundi on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram and at his website www.henrinyakarundi.com. Henri grew up in Burundi to Rwandese parents. A self-described indifferent and rebellious student, he was expelled twice from high school. Henri only stumbled upon the world of entrepreneurship after he moved to the US for university. He launched several businesses which all failed before he set up a successful trucking business. But, burnt out from the trucking business and reeling from the 2008 financial crisis, Henri packed his bags and returned to Africa. He moved to Rwanda to test the market for a solar-powered kiosk which would be used for charging phones and became the core product of ARED Group. The kiosk was a hit and has gone through multiple iterations to adapt to it bottom of the pyramid customer base. ARED Group sells multiple services on its kiosks, providing Internet connectivity, collecting data for NGO and corporate partners, in addition to offering its mainstay service of phone charging. Because as Henri stresses in our conversation, when you\u2019re targeting customers with limited disposable income, you need multiple revenue streams. ARED Group has won the Siemens Empowerment Award, Africa Forum 100 Innovation for Sustainable Development Award, and the SEIF Social Entrepreneurship Award.

Prior to Africa\u2019s Talking, Sam worked for Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, in the US and Hong Kong. In the Asia office, he helped build the high frequency trading platform and led a team trading hundreds of millions of dollars per day. In 2010, intrigued by the burgeoning tech scene in his home country of Kenya, he set up with a co-founder Africa\u2019s Talking. While it started as a side hustle, two years later, Sam took on a full-time COO/CTO role in the company, developing the software developer-facing part of the business. As demand for business APIs in Kenya exploded with the strong growth of tech startups and mobile money payment solutions, Africa\u2019s Talking software developer business took off. The company turned profitable after only 1 year of operations. Africa\u2019s Talking helps the growing software developer community across the continent integrate into the telecoms infrastructure by simplifying the required processes and technologies. It offers APIs for short codes, payments, and communications, including bulk SMS, USSD, and voice. Africa\u2019s Talking is in seven African markets with its hub based in Nairobi, Kenya. Last April, Sam and his team closed a $8.6mn fundraising round that was led by the IFC\u2019s venture capital arm which Africa\u2019s Talking will use to further its expansion, especially into Francophone West Africa. I thoroughly enjoyed my conversation with Sam who\u2019s a real thought leader in Africa\u2019s tech space. Make sure you listen to our entire chat. He explains why he\u2019s bullish on Ethiopia, why capital is overrated in the early stages of a startup, and why he advocates sharpening your toolkit before diving headfirst into entrepreneurship. Without further ado, here\u2019s my conversation with Sam Gikandi.</p>\n",

Cynics \u2014 and the cocoa sector has a few \u2014 might say it\u2019s pie in the sky. But, this is the wrong attitude. I survived a year and a half trading cocoa and I know that the sector does not lend itself to innovation. But, as margins for commodity traders get whittled down, traders need to boost efficiencies, which Blockchain can provide.

Whether right or wrong, it is synonymous with child labor and rampant deforestation, which has made chocolate companies more vigilant about their supply chains. All of this to say that a Blockchain-enabled solution that could solve the trust issue that plagues cocoa trading is much needed.

Today is a special \u201cbest of\u201d episode where I\u2019m going to highlight the top ten tips, advice, hacks for cultivating an entrepreneur mindset. Since the podcast launched, I\u2019ve interviewed a dozen amazing entrepreneurs with thriving businesses in Africa. They\u2019ve candidly shared advice, tips, and insights into how they persevere in the face of challenges. What\u2019s remarkable is that all of these entrepreneurs share a common mindset that has been critical to their success. As renowned entrepreneur Tony Robbins said, success as an entrepreneur is 20% skills and 80% psychology, or mindset. You have to develop the right psychology to handle the emotional rollercoaster of being an African entrepreneur. Being an entrepreneur anywhere is tough, but I\u2019d argue that being an entrepreneur in Africa is even more difficult. When I looked through my notes from past episodes, it was incredible to see the similarities of these entrepreneurs. Whatever the subject was \u2013 whether it be networking, finding an idea for your business, or dealing with inevitable failure \u2013 these entrepreneurs had similar opinions and approaches. I thought it would be helpful to pick the top ten tips on cultivating an entrepreneur mindset from our past guests. I\u2019m constantly pushing myself to experiment with the podcast because I want to make the best content for you, the YAE listener.

You can connect with him @wizaj on Twitter and via his website http://wiza.jalaka.si. By 16, Wiza had already founded his company, Mwtunes, an online music distribution platform that was ahead of its time in his home country of Malawi. At university in Nairobi, he and his cofounder set up Djuaji, Research, a market research company that paid survey participants via mobile money. It held a lot of promise. It was innovative, cost effective, and accurate. Early on, Djuaji raised seed capital from Savannah Fund and participated in its elite accelerator program. It all seemed to be going well. Until it wasn\u2019t. Wiza and his cofounder were running out of cash and they weren\u2019t close to figuring out how to make the business viable. He made a tough choice: He resigned and returned to Malawi. Shortly thereafter, he spoke with Sam Gikandi, founder of Africa is Talking, an API developer, who offered him a job to set up the Malawi office. Wiza had some reservations about working for someone else, but he quickly overcame those doubts and has never looked back. Africa is Talking recently raised $8.6mn for its expansion into new markets, including Cote d\u2019Ivoire, which Wiza will be spearheading. I thoroughly enjoyed my conversation with Wiza. He\u2019s extremely eloquent and a fount of knowledge about the emotional roller coaster of being a young African tech entrepreneur.

It was innovative, cost effective, and accurate. Early on, Djuaji raised seed capital from Savannah Fund and participated in its elite accelerator program. It all seemed to be going well. Until it wasn\u2019t. Wiza and his cofounder were running out of cash and they weren\u2019t close to figuring out how to make the business viable. He made a tough choice: He resigned and returned to Malawi. Shortly thereafter, he spoke with Sam Gikandi, founder of Africa is Talking, an API developer, who offered him a job to set up the Malawi office. Wiza had some reservations about working for someone else, but he quickly overcame those doubts and has never looked back. Africa is Talking recently raised $8.6mn for its expansion into new markets, including Cote d\u2019Ivoire, which Wiza will be spearheading. I thoroughly enjoyed my conversation with Wiza.
