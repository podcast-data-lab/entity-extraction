We\u2019ll talk to microbiologist Professor Gavin H Thomas, microbiologist Research Associate Professor Julie Horvath, epidemiologist Associate Professor Hanno Ulmer, and epidemiologist Professor Julia Knight.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a link to our transcript: https://bit.ly/sciencevsdeodorant\u00a0\n\nThis episode was produced by Meryl Horn, with help from Michelle Dang, Disha Bhagat, Rose Rimler, Courtney Gilbert, and Wendy Zukerman.
