                "summary": "We\u2019ve been told that foods like butter and bacon are bad for us \u2014 because they're packed with saturated fats. And top dogs in nutrition say that a better option is vegetable oil, like canola oil. But there\u2019s a trend popping off claiming that these top dogs are barking up the wrong tree. They say that butter is better and that those vegetable oils, aka \u201cseed oils,\u201d are incredibly dangerous. So \u2014 who\u2019s right? Is canola oil really killing us? Or is butter the bad boy?\n\nTo find out, we speak to author and physician Dr Cate Shanahan, professor of nutrition science Jason Wu, professor of endocrinology David Schade, and Dr David Iggman.\n\nFind our transcript here: https://bit.ly/ScienceVsSeedOils\u00a0\n\nA new Season of Heavyweight is out now! Find them here: https://gimletmedia.com/shows/heavyweight\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, we cover:\n(00:00) Seed oils are the devil\n(05:35) Is saturated fat killing you?\n(12:25) Does cholesterol cause heart attacks?\u00a0\n(22:02) Do seed oils cause inflammation?\n(28:00) Are seed oils killing you?\n\nThis episode was produced by Wendy Zukerman, with help from Joel Werner, Rose Rimler, Nick DelRose and Michelle Dang.

We\u2019ll talk to microbiologist Professor Gavin H Thomas, microbiologist Research Associate Professor Julie Horvath, epidemiologist Associate Professor Hanno Ulmer, and epidemiologist Professor Julia Knight.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a link to our transcript: https://bit.ly/sciencevsdeodorant\u00a0\n\nThis episode was produced by Meryl Horn, with help from Michelle Dang, Disha Bhagat, Rose Rimler, Courtney Gilbert, and Wendy Zukerman. We\u2019re edited by Blythe Terrell. Additional editing help from Caitlin Kenney and Nicole Beemsterboer. Wendy Zukerman is our Executive Producer. Fact checking by Erica Akiko Howard. Mix and sound design by Bumi Hidaka. Music written by Bumi Hidaka, Emma Munger, Bobby Lord, and Peter Leonard. Thanks to all our listeners who left voicemails about their stinky pitties.

So we\u2019re looking at the science here, and asking: are the medical treatments for trans kids dangerous? And do trans folks have an advantage when it comes to sports? We talk to Florence Ashley, Dr. Jack Turban, and Joanna Harper to find out.\nUPDATE 5/17/22: A previous version of this episode incorrectly summarized a study from Seattle. We said those who got gender-affirming healthcare \"felt better\" after getting the treatment. The study actually found that those who got this treatment felt better compared to those who didn't get the treatment.

The CDC and FDA have recommended pausing the vaccine while they learn more.\n\nDetails are here: https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0413-JJ-vaccine.html\u00a0\n\nJust as coronavirus vaccinations are ramping up, a bunch of new variants are here, threatening to muck everything up.

We speak to biologist Dr. John Cooley, ecologist Dr. Louie Yang, mycologist Dr. Matt Kasson, and evolutionary biologist Prof. Chris Simon.\u00a0\n\nCheck out the transcript right here: http://bit.ly/3cnpD95\n\n\n\nYou can help scientists map out the 2021 Brood X emergence by snapping photos of the cicadas with your smartphone! \u2013 To join in, check out the Cicada Safari app at www.cicadasafari.org\u00a0\n\nTo learn more and see if Brood X is going to pop up in your area, check out:\u00a0https://cicadas.uconn.edu/brood_10/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis episode was produced by Michelle Dang with help from me, Wendy Zukerman, as well as, Nick DelRose, Taylor White, Meryl Horn, and Rose Rimler.

We take you inside the core of America\u2019s biggest nuclear power plant and trace what went wrong at Fukushima to try to figure out: when will the next meltdown happen? And what our chances are of getting cancer from it? This week we talk to Dr. Spencer Wheatley, Dr. Jonathan Samet, and Jack Cadogan, an executive at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.\nUPDATE! We\u2019ve made a couple of small changes to this episode, thank you to all the listeners who picked up on them.\u00a01. We called the energy that comes from nuclear power a chemical reaction\u2026 it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a nuclear reaction. Chemical reactions involve the electrons in an atom. Nuclear reactions involve the nucleus.\u00a02. We said that the Joker became The Joker After falling into a vat of radioactive waste. This is disputed. It seems it was a vat chemicals.. But what those chemicals were , that\u2019s unclear. 3. A clarification: We said that the waste that nuclear power produces in the US\u2026 2200 metric tons per year\u2026 was like 323 male African Elephants. That was a weight comparison. They weigh roughly the same\u2026 It wasn\u2019t a three dimensional size comparison. Nuclear waste is much denser than an elephant, and so it takes up much less room. And if you want to read the most amazing calculation from an academic of how much bigger 323 African Elephants are in 3D space you\u2019ve got to sign up to our brand spanking new newsletter! To do that head to https://gimletmedia.com/newsletter/\u00a0And FINALLY! We got a lot of feedback from that episode that listeners really wanted to hear how nuclear power compares to other energy sources: like coal, solar and wind! Now we decided that to do a fair comparison that really needs it\u2019s own episode - it wasn\u2019t as simple as just throwing out some numbers. So we\u2019re working on that episode for next season.\nOur Sponsors:\nCloudflare - To learn more visit cloudflare.com/sciencevs\nCredits:\nThis episode has been produced by Heather Rogers, Ben Kuebrich, Shruti Ravindran and Wendy Zukerman.Kaitlyn Sawrey is our senior producer.
