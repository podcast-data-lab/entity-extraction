Well, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more inspiring story than this one, from long ago. Tenley Albright was the very first American woman to win the Olympic gold medal in figure skating, and the first to win the World Championship. That was in 1956. It was a remarkable feat, made all the more so, because Tenley Albright was a polio survivor.  After those Olympics, she entered Harvard Medical School - one of only 5 women - and spent the next decades as a surgeon, a researcher, and a professor. At 86, she is still running a center she founded at MIT to devise creative solutions to public health issues.  She talks here about how her recovery from polio contributed to her success as a skater, and how the lessons of skating prepared her for a life in medicine.  She also tells some wonderful stories from the Winter Olympics, and shares her gentle insights about motivation and competition."

But what connects Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, and Ted Turner, founder of CNN, share, is a competitive drive and an ability to see opportunity, where others see only pitfalls.  Both men talk here about their journeys to mega-success in business, and in sailboat racing too!  "

                "summary": "Louise Gl\u00fcck uses simple, unsentimental language in her poems to evoke overwhelming emotions.  That rare combination is what has distinguished her as one of America's greatest living poets, for over half a century. In this episode, the Pulitzer Prize-winning, former Poet Laureate of the United States digs into the torment and uncertainty that has hounded her throughout her writing life.  She talks about how teaching poetry, which she feared would diminish her art, instead allowed it to flourish.   And she describes her obsessive desire to hear music in her ears, and language in her head. \r\n\r\n"

                "summary": "Sally Field is one of the best actresses in America... on film, on television and on stage.  She's won Emmy Awards and Academy Awards, and has had starring roles on Broadway. But early in her career, she was boxed in by her own success on tv, playing flighty girls like Gidget and The Flying Nun, and she couldn't find a way out.  But Sally Field would not accept that destiny.  She trained with the best acting teacher, Lee Strasberg, and transformed herself.  It took a while for Hollywood to catch up with her, but eventually got the kind of roles and recognition she deserved -- for films like \"Norma Rae,\"  \"Places in the Heart,\" \"Steel Magnolias,\"  \"Forrest Gump\" and many others.  In this episode you'll get to know just how funny and charming and profound Sally Field is, as she talks candidly about her process of reinvention, and her discovery that fear is an essential path to change.
