And the BBC\u2019s Liza Fokht in Moscow has been asking Russians what they think about the invasion. \n\nBack in Ukraine, we catch up with Max, whose son and wife were injured when a missile hit their home in Kyiv last week. \n\nThis episode of Ukrainecast was made by Estelle Doyle with Natalie Ktena, Phil Marzouk and Alix Pickles.

Adam is joined by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspector of Constabulary Zo\u00eb Billingham, and Janey Starling, co-director of the feminist organisation, Level Up, to discuss what more needs to be done to protect women from violence.\n\u00a0\nToday\u2019s Newscast was made by Rick Kelsey with producers Georgia Coan and Alix Pickles. The studio director was Emma Crowe. Sam Bonham was the assistant editor."
