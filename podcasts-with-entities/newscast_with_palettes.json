Shadow cabinet minister, Andy McDonald, has quit Labour\u2019s frontbench with a scathing attack on Sir Keir Starmer on the eve of his major speech to the Brighton delegates. He\u2019s accused the Labour leader of making the party \u201cmore divided than ever\u201d and breaking promises to members over working conditions. Adam and Laura are on the conference floor to assess how it\u2019s gone down. Plus, Laura stumbles across Newscast superfan Jacob, who wangles his way onto the pod.\n\nAlso in a Brexitcast-esque crossover, Katya calls in from Berlin, where Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have claimed a narrow election victory, telling the party of Angela Merkel it should no longer be in power. But the outgoing chancellor\u2019s retirement is on hold for what could be weeks of coalition negotiations, with conservative Armin Laschet determined to fight on.\n\nToday\u2019s Newscast was made by Caitlin Hanrahan with producers Danny Wittenberg, Ben Cooper and Soila Apparicio. The studio director was Emma Crowe and the assistant editor was Sam Bonham. The editor is Jonathan Aspinwall."

Fergus and Vicki are here with Adam to go through the \u2018Plan A\u2019, which includes booster jabs, and the potentially more dramatic \u2018Plan B\u2019. Vaccine passports haven\u2019t been ruled out. And in a surreal turn of events at the announcement, Boris Johnson and Professor Chris Whitty ended up in a spat with rapper Nicki Minaj \u2013 and even our very own Laura Kuenssberg was brought into it.\n \nPrince Andrew is being sued in New York over allegations of sexual assault by Virginia Giuffre, but his new lawyer says the legal papers haven\u2019t properly been served. Emily Maitlis comes in to break down the details and talk about the possible significance of *that* Newsnight interview.\n\nAnd, hey presto: the Magic Circle has its first female president! We\u2019ve conjured up the pioneering magician herself, Megan Swann, who tells us about her new job and has a special trick for Newscasters.\n\nToday\u2019s Newscast was made by Emma Close with Danny Wittenberg and Georgia Coan. The studio director was Emma Crowe. The editor is Jonathan Aspinwall."
