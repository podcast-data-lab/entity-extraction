    "description": "What happens when the Bible and humanity collide? Not what you\u2019d expect. Living & Effective, a podcast collaboration between Christianity Today and the Christian Standard Bible, journeys through history, current events, theology and the human condition to uncover surprising ways the Bible accomplishes God\u2019s plan in the world. By confronting these issues and more, this podcast series takes listeners on a journey through the Bible's role as living and effective in the world and challenges our assumptions about culture and Scripture.",

Living & Effective, a podcast collaboration between Christianity Today and the Christian Standard Bible, journeys through history, current events, theology and the human condition to uncover surprising ways the Bible accomplishes God\u2019s plan in the world. By confronting these issues and more, this podcast series takes listeners on a journey through the Bible's role as living and effective in the world and challenges our assumptions about culture and Scripture."
