This week, Jordan and Joshua break down the timeline events of that made Gamestop stock soar and make redditors millionaires overnight. Journalist and writer for VICE MOTHERBOARD Matthew Gault simplifies how the stock market works, what \"shorting\" is, the major conflicted interest with Robinhood's involvement, and how savvy redditors banded together and created this frenzy. Fellow MOTHERBOARD writer and GME investor Jason Koebler, who wrote his own explainer of the entire situation, discusses why Robinhood appealed to young investors, including the subreddit r/wallstreetbets that lead to Gamestop stock to soar, which in turn angered hedge funds who shorted the stock. Plus, Jason discusses how this seemingly David vs. Goliath story has a darker side when looking at the toxicity of wallstreetbets and what the future holds for this brave new stock market that might not fully represent the valuation of companies and the economy at large.\nFollow Wild Wild Tech\nLove Wild Wild Tech, but hate the ads?

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Amidst the influencers, cute animals, memes and other videos on Instagram lives a bizarre, dark and strangely legal underworld where people buy and sell human skulls, bones and body parts.  Jordan Erica Webber and Joshua Rivera dig deep into this macabre marketplace where they meet with Henry Scragg, proprietor of curiositiesfromthe5thcorner, and actual buyer and seller of human skulls and other death-related oddities. They also learn that the trading of human bones is nothing new and actually dates back to about the 1800s. Writer Oscar Schwartz's article outlines the history of the troublesome practice as it was used in phrenology and other outdated sciences, and attributes it to cultural appropriation. And although Instagram is now the go-to to buying marketplace, it began on eBay and other sites in the early days of the internet, and is showing no signs of slowing. Oscar explains how this trading in body parts is a remnant of colonialists who exploited and even killed indigenous people, but Henry defends his business as embracing death as part of life, detailing how one can be a responsible and discerning skull-trader.
