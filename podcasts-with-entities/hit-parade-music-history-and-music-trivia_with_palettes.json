                "summary": "If an instrumental tops the charts, it\u2019s probably an earworm: \u201cTequila.\u201d \u201cWipeout.\u201d \u201cDueling Banjos.\u201d \u201cThe Hustle.\u201d \u201cFeels So Good.\u201d \u201cChariots of Fire.\u201d \u201cAxel F.\u201d You can probably whistle or hum several of those from memory. But do you remember the artists? All were one-hit wonders. By and large, instrumental hits throughout chart history were flukes.\n\nBut there were exceptions: a trumpet player from Los Angeles who pretended to be Latin, made up a fake mariachi band, put sexy models on his album covers and topped the charts almost as much as the Beatles. Or, a try-hard, perm-headed soprano saxophone player from Seattle, who turned holding his breath while playing dizzying runs of notes into an athletic feat.\n\nHow do songs without words become hits? Why were Herb Alpert and Kenny G so good at it? Why did instrumentals fall off the charts after the \u201980s\u2014and who is bringing them back? (Hint: think oontz-oontz-oontz.) Join Chris Molanphy as he throws away the lyric sheet and explains how a catchy melody can be worth a thousand words.\n\nPodcast production by Kevin Bendis.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

It turns out, a lot: Each man has a wide-ranging ethnic and musical background, with early exposure to unusual sides of showbiz. Each has scored hits in a variety of styles.

In fact, on all three of his No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot\u00a0100, keyboards are\u00a0not\u00a0the primary instrument.\nThe truth is, Joel isn\u2019t the Piano Man, he\u2019s the pastiche man. He has openly admitted to borrowing genre tropes, vocal styles, and even specific song hooks from his Baby Boom-era heroes, from Ray Charles to the Beatles to the Supremes. He\u2019s been a jazzy crooner, a saloon balladeer, an anthem rocker, even a pseudo-punk. And on his most hit-packed album, he literally tried on a different song mode on every single\u2014and was rewarded for it. This month, Hit Parade breaks down the uncanny success of pop magpie Billy Joel, the guy who would try anything for a hit: the next phase, new wave, dance craze, any ways.\n\nPodcast production by Benjamin Frisch and Kevin Bendis\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "The early \u201970s was a great time for R&B queens on the charts: Roberta Flack. Dionne Warwick. Patti LaBelle. Chaka Khan. They had come through the \u201960s\u2014Dionne as a smooth pop-and-B star, Patti as a girl-group frontwoman, Roberta as a cabaret pianist\u2014and found themselves in a new decade with limitless possibilities. Flack turned folk songs into chart-topping, Grammy-winning R&B. Warwick shifted from Brill Building pop to Philly soul. LaBelle threw her insane voice at rock, funk, and glam. And a relative newcomer, Rufus frontwoman Chaka Khan, followed in their footsteps, commanding the band and converting to disco, then electro. By the \u201980s, all four women were ready for a major chart victory lap.\n\nJoin host Chris Molanphy as he traces four parallel careers that expanded the definition of soul from the \u201960s through the \u201980s and beyond. These soul sisters, flow sisters, bold sisters\u2026killed us softly, walked on by and were, finally, every woman.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"

And none has been more condensed by Christmas than another artist who was once famous enough to go by her first name: Brenda.

Punk\u2019s whole reason for being was rejecting the mainstream. But punk wasn\u2019t just a movement\u2014it was also a genre. And 20 years after it first emerged, punk went from underground to overground, dominating the radio for the first time.\n\u00a0\nIn this episode of Hit Parade, Chris Molanphy traces how punk traveled from Sid Vicious to strip mall, through the lineage of \u201990s bands Green Day, Offspring and Blink\u2011182, and \u201900s emo artisans Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco and their skinny-jeans-wearing, smarty-pants contemporaries. From the CBGB era to the current Billboard Hot 100, punk is no historical artifact\u2014it\u2019s still morphing and adapting. And for all its supposed opposition to convention, the dirty little secret is: Punk has always been catchy.\n\u00a0\nPodcast production by Asha Saluja with help from Rosemary Belson.\n\nWe have a special announcement!

And with good reason: Carole King. Marvin Gaye. Joni Mitchell. Sly Stone. Janis Joplin. The Who. All released their best work a half-century ago.\nFor our 50th episode of Hit Parade, we go back 50 years, celebrating the semicentennial of the year when, critics claim, \u201cmusic changed everything.\u201d The Quiet Beatle became the Favorite Beatle, when Mick Jagger sang lyrics even he regrets, when Carole King graduated from songwriter to singer-songwriter, and commercial juggernaut, when blaxploitation took over the charts and the Oscars, and when the radio was somehow awash in Osmonds. It wasn\u2019t a perfect year\u2014but Hit\u00a0Parade host Chris Molanphy is fond of \u201971 for personal reasons.\n\u00a0Podcast production by Asha Saluja with help from Rosemary Belson.\n\nSign up for Slate Plus now to get episodes in one installment as soon as they're out.

Malcolm X challenges Sam Cooke to use his amazing voice to help \u201cthe struggle.\u201d Little did he know Cooke had already recorded his civil\u2011rights masterpiece, \u201cA Change Is Gonna Come.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn this episode, Chris Molanphy sets the record straight on the man now called the King of Soul. In his too-brief career\u2014seven years as a gospel star, then seven more as a chart-conquering superstar\u2014Sam Cooke took a remarkable journey: from the pathbreaking pop of \u201cYou Send Me,\u201d to the wistful R&B of \u201c(What a) Wonderful World,\u201d to the yearning romance of \u201cBring It on Home to Me,\u201d to\u2014of course\u2014the now-legendary \u201cChange Is Gonna Come.\u201d Meet the man who defined what soul music was and could be.\n\u00a0\nHit Parade episodes are now split into two parts, released two weeks apart.

But it was their next album (can you name it?) that topped the Billboard album chart.\n\u00a0\nChris Molanphy has coined a term for this weird chart phenomenon: He calls it The AC/DC Rule. Just as less-good movie sequels open better at the box office than classic first installments, follow-up albums often chart higher than their slow-growing but hit-packed predecessors. Some of the rock and pop legends who fell prey to this chart phenomenon might surprise you\u2026might just leave you shook all night long.\n\u00a0\nPodcast production by Asha Saluja.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

But it\u2019s possible no hitmaking mastermind\u2014not even Phil Spector\u2014has had a more specific pop sound than Jim Steinman. His songs have an unmistakable signature: pounding pianos, revving motorcycles, sometimes literal thunder. And power-vocalists singing passionate lyrics that don\u2019t always make sense but always sound like the fate of the world depends on this song.\nChris Molanphy tells the story of a fervent, headstrong songwriter who fused with a singer who called himself Meat Loaf, creating a blockbuster song cycle called Bat Out of Hell. Steinman then went on to spread his pomp-rock to other artists: Bonnie Tyler\u2019s \u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heart.\u201d Air Supply\u2019s \u201cMaking Love Out of Nothing at All.\u201d Celine Dion\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s All Coming Back to Me Now.\u201d Every song sounded like a hallelujah chorus and a Broadway show\u2014even though Steinman\u2019s actual Broadway show was a notorious flop. But nothing keeps Jim Steinman down. Forever\u2019s gonna start tonight.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"

While the economic challenges of COVID-19 certainly haven\u2019t abated, Hit Parade has attracted enough new Plus members to allow us to take some episodes out from behind Slate\u2019s paywall starting in September.\n\nStarting next month, full-length Hit Parade episodes will debut in the middle of the month, not the end (our next full-length episode drops on Friday, September 18). If you are a Plus member, you\u2019ll hear the whole show all at once, the day it drops. If you are not a Plus member, you will receive the first half of the episode mid-month, with ads, and you\u2019ll have to wait a couple of weeks to hear the second half of the show, at month\u2019s end. Finally, Hit Parade\u2014\u201cThe Bridge\u201d episodes will remain Plus-only.\n\nIAgain, thanks to many of you who signed up for Slate Plus just to hear Hit Parade, and of course the thousands of longtime Plus members. We plan to keep giving you the bonus content you expect. And a hearty welcome back to non-Plus listeners\u2014we hope you\u2019ll consider joining Slate Plus in the future, but you can also support Hit Parade by spreading the word about our episodes. And to sign up for Slate Plus to support the show, head over to\u00a0slate.com/hitparadeplus.\n\n\nIn this mini-episode of Hit Parade, host Chris Molanphy is joined by J.D. Ryznar, \u201cHollywood\u201d Steve Huey, and Dave Lyons, creators of the web series Yacht Rock and follow-up podcast Beyond Yacht Rock. Not only did they invent the very term that inspired the latest episode of Hit Parade, they have kept the fire alive by refining what the genre means.\n\nThe Yacht Rockers and Chris discuss the enduring legacy of the term they created\u2014from why the name stuck, to how it was perceived by the various artists whose music it defined. (Boz Scaggs is reportedly not happy.) They also reveal songs they\u2019d re-rate against their signature Yachtski scale, songs commonly tagged Yacht that are actually \u201cNyacht,\u201d and how they curate the boundaries of the genre. They even offer a Hit Parade\u2013exclusive announcement about what\u2019s next for their smooth creation.\n\nFinally, Chris quizzes a Slate Plus listener with some music trivia, gives her a chance to turn the tables on him, and previews next month\u2019s full-length episode.\n\nPodcast production by Asha Saluja.\u00a0\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Gina and Chris discuss the most recent full-length episode of Hit Parade, OutKast\u2019s roots in Atlanta\u2019s decades-long funk tradition, and what they meant to Southerners who felt alienated not just by bicoastal hip-hop but also by Atlanta\u2019s unequal progress on the challenges faced by its black residents.\n\nNext, Chris quizzes a Slate Plus listener with some music trivia, and the contestant turns the tables with a chance to try to stump Chris with a question of his own. Then, Chris teases the upcoming full-length episode of Hit Parade, which will look at Lilith Fair, the all-female festival tour in the late \u201990s, how it reflected women\u2019s role in alternative rock, and its legacy to this day.\u00a0\n\nA special Hit Parade announcement: Like many media organizations at the moment, Slate is getting hit pretty hard by what's going on with the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Chris tells Asha why Beyonc\u00e9, indisputably one of the decade\u2019s most influential artists, didn\u2019t make it into the episode. Then Chris and Asha talk about a few of their favorite singles of the decade--some made it onto the Billboard Hot 100, and others didn\u2019t. Chris quizzes a Slate Plus listener with some music trivia, and the contestant turns the tables with a chance to try to stump Chris with a question of his own. Then, Chris teases the upcoming full-length episode of Hit Parade, which will be a look at Christmas music\u2019s record on the Hot 100--including a record that just might be broken this year if a beloved holiday tune by a certain chart-running pop diva hits No.\u00a01. And finally, Chris corrects the record on some mistakes he\u2019s made in Hit Parade this year. Anyone remember \u201cmeekrat\u201d?\u00a0\n\nWhile this episode is available to all listeners, our trivia round is open only to Slate Plus members. If you are a member\u2014or once you become a member\u2014enter as a contestant here.\n\nWant your question featured in an upcoming show?

And even when Broadway tried to rock\u2014from Hair to Jesus Christ Superstar\u2014a new generation grew wary of characters breaking into song (unless they were animated mermaids, teapots or lions).

                "summary": "From a very young age, Britney Spears seemed destined for stardom. The kid from Louisiana had landed a role on the revived Mickey Mouse Club and styled herself as a belter of power ballads. But to score her first No. 1 hit, Spears would team up with an introverted Swedish songwriter named Max Martin. He was trying to write American R&B and instead, through Britney and her high-school dance formations, created a new template for \u00fcber\u2013American teen-pop. This month, we go inside the Stockholm music factory\u2014and its decades-long history, from ABBA to Ace of Base\u2014that gave rise to a new generation of millennial pop, from the Backstreet Boys and *N Sync to Robyn and Taylor Swift.\u00a0\nEmail: hitparade@slate.com\u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

That angers music critics, who have been slagging off this band of hard-rock prom kings since the 1980s. Among the haters is Hit Parade host Chris Molanphy, who has loathed Bon Jovi since high school. But even he can\u2019t deny it: Bon Jovi are hugely influential. In the wake of their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Chris puts aside his animus to explain how the biggest band in hair metal have remained strangely relevant\u2014thanks to their deathless hits, their album sales and, more recently, their influence on a certain hair-metal-loving Swedish pop producer.\u00a0\nEmail: hitparade@slate.com \u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.
