    "description": "For at least a decade, allegations of cheating have swirled around elections in rural Bladen County, N.C. Some people in town point fingers at a Black advocacy group, the Bladen County Improvement Association, accusing it of bullying voters, tampering with ballots and stealing votes outright. These accusations have never been substantiated, but they persist.   \n\nReporter Zoe Chace went to Bladen County to investigate what\u2019s really going on. From the makers of Serial and The New York Times, a five-part series about allegations of election fraud \u2014 and the powerful forces that fuel them. \n",
