We are back with part two of our Relationship Gold series, and the gems are reloading, so take a listen to part one to make sure you're ready for this round. In this episode, we bring you another conversation on relationships \u2013 this time we're talking about building and sustaining them, as we consider if and why marriage and monogamy are still important to us. Do we still need it? How do we navigate it? Will we be the breadwinners as Black women and WHY are we even trying to win in a relationship in the first place?? Then we dig in with the hilarious and uber talented Niecy Nash, who answers all of these questions and more, reflects on being her own best advocate in front of and behind the camera, AND shares why her marriage with Jessica Betts is the first time she's ever felt fully and completely seen.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

The whole Fab 5 lineup is here and ready to talk after a summer full of questions \u2013 and we need answers. As we head back to work, school, and well, reality, we're talking about a reboot.

In this episode, we're breaking it all the way down, from our Black couple goals to how vulnerability and sexuality play into what it\u2019s like to love and be loved. We open up about dating as a Black woman, the love lessons from our parents, and what makes a good relationship work. Then, we get into it with the one and only Meagan Good, who's spent much of her career telling Black love stories, and has so many stories of her own she's now ready to tell. She shares some gems about being a woman of faith in Hollywood, getting over people not loving your energy, and how she came back to herself after a skin-lightening experience that changed her life.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
