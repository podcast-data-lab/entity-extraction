    "description": "The future. It\u2019s exciting; it\u2019s discomforting. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening next\u2014 in the next four minutes on Twitter or in the next four years of democracy.\u00a0\u00a0\nHave a Nice Future is a new podcast from WIRED, where each week, Wired\u2019s Senior Writer Lauren Goode & Contributor Gideon Lichfield speak with the top technologists, thinkers, and creators who are shaping this future we\u2019re racing into. Every episode, we\u2019ll ask each guest\u2014and ourselves\u2014the same question: Is this the future we want? And if not, where do we go from here?\nShare your thoughts via our Listener Survey here: https://selfserve.decipherinc.com/survey/selfserve/222b/75187?pin=1&uBRANDLINK=7&uCHANNELLINK=2",

Sony\u2019s newest game console has been very difficult to purchase since it was released in November\u2014so much so that folks have resorted to using sniper bots, inside sources, and other shady practices to sidestep the scrum and snag that PS5.\nThis week, we\u2019re joined by Alan Henry and Saira Mueller from the WIRED video games team, and Jeffrey Van Camp from WIRED\u2019s reviews team to talk about the issues keeping PS5 supplies low. They\u2019ll also tell us about their own experiences trying to buy a console. At the end of the show, we share some shopping tips you can use on your own quest to get this year\u2019s most scarce gadget.\nShow Notes:\u00a0\nRead some advice about how to (maybe) buy a PS5 here. Read more about the scalper bots buying up all the PS5s here.\u00a0\nRecommendations:\u00a0\nSaira\u2019s recommendation is to try cryotherapy. Brrr! Alan recommends Discord, which is great for gaming parties. Jeff recommends that you get a snow shovel, because you never know when you might need it. Lauren recommends this CBS guide to how you can help people in Texas during this deadly cold weather. Mike recommends the Vice show Hamilton\u2019s Pharmacopeia, now in its third season.\nSaira Mueller can be found on Twitter @SairaMueller. Alan Henry is @halophoenix. Jeff Van Camp is @JeffreyVC. Lauren Goode is @LaurenGoode. Michael Calore is @snackfight. Bling the main hotline at @GadgetLab. The show is produced by Boone Ashworth (@booneashworth).

These topics, among others, were the subject of a conversation Musk had on Clubhouse, the voice chat app that's big with Silicon Valley VC types. But Musk's appearance may have been a turning point for the app that moves it into the mainstream. After Musk's talk, Clubhouse's user base nearly doubled, going from 3 to 5 million almost overnight. It's a powerful, popular format, and one that other social media companies are eager to get muscle their way into.\nThis week on Gadget Lab, former cohost of the show and WIRED senior writer Arielle Pardes joins us to dish about Elon, Clubhouse, and where this kind of social platform goes from here.\nShow Notes:\u00a0\nRead more about Elon Musk\u2019s visit to Clubhouse. Coverage of GameStop and Robinhood is here. You can also listen to audio of Musk\u2019s Clubhouse appearance.\nRecommendations:\u00a0\nArielle recommends the wine delivery service from Eater Wine Club. Lauren recommends the show Your Honor on Showtime. Mike recommends the autobiography Being Ram Dass by, well, Ram Dass.\nArielle Pardes can be found on Twitter @pardesoteric.

                "summary": "The idea behind the Citizen app is that its users upload videos of the things that are going on in the neighborhood in real time \u2014 anything from as a gas leak to something potentially a lot more violent. It's an app built on the premise that the more information a community has the better off it is, but it also comes with all of the trappings and problems of a lot of community surveillance \u2014 the app has some toxic comments, it can lead to racial profiling, and it has sparked a lot of discussion about who\u2019s benefitting most from all of these neighborhood alerts \u2014 the users, law enforcement, or Citizen itself. WIRED's Boone Ashworth has spent months on the Citizen app, trying to better understand exactly what its mission is, and what this kind of hyper-vigilance does to our psyches.
