We can exchange otherwise worthless paper bills for fresh groceries, or swipe a piece of plastic for new clothes. But this trust\u2014typically in a central government-backed bank\u2014is changing. As our financial lives are rapidly digitized, the resulting data turns into fodder for AI. Companies like Apple, Facebook and Google see it as an opportunity to disrupt the entire experience of how people think about and engage with their money. But will we as consumers really get more control over our finances? In this first of a series on automation and our wallets, we explore a digital revolution in how we pay for things.\n\nWe meet:\nUmar Farooq, CEO of Onyx by J.P. Morgan Chase\nJosh Woodward, Director of product management for Google Pay\nEd McLaughlin, President of operations and technology for MasterCard\nCraig Vosburg, Chief product officer for MasterCard\n\nCredits\nThis episode was produced by Anthony Green, with help from Jennifer Strong, Karen Hao, Will Douglas Heaven and Emma Cillekens. We\u2019re edited by Michael Reilly. Special thanks to our events team for recording part of this episode at our AI conference, Emtech Digital."
