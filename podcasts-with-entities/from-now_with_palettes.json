    "description": "A famed lost spaceship, the USS HOPE, returns to Earth after vanishing thirty-five years prior. The lone survivor (Richard Madden) disembarks mysteriously\u200b looking the exact same age as when he left\u200b. Following the ensuing media chaos, he finally reunites with his formerly identical twin brother (now an old man) for a one-on-one meeting. But what starts as a joyful reconciliation soon leads to dark revelations that threaten their relationship -- and the future of humanity. \n\nFROM NOW stars and is Executive Produced by Richard Madden and Brian Cox. Created & Written by Rhys Wakefield and William Day Frank.",
