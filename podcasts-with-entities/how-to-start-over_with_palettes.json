Inertia is powerful, mortgages and marriages are long-term, and personality traits can feel pretty hardwired. But we\u2019re in an era characterized by change.

In order to overcome struggle\u2014breakups, illness, even death\u2014we must first accept and acknowledge its inevitability. Exploring the darkness of our suffering may seem counterintuitive, but often it\u2019s the only way to see the light.\u00a0\nIn this week\u2019s episode, Arthur C. Brooks sits down with BJ Miller, a palliative-care physician, to uncover how we can face our deepest fears, why we should accept our natural limitations as human beings, and how to make peace with the ebb and flow of joy and suffering in human life\u2014an experience we all share.\nThis episode was produced by Rebecca Rashid and hosted by Arthur Brooks.

Inertia is powerful, mortgages and marriages are long-term, and personality traits can feel pretty hardwired. But we\u2019re in an era characterized by change. This series is your guide to starting over in the ways you\u2019ve always wanted, why change is so hard, and whether it is, sometimes, overrated.\nThis series was produced by Rebecca Rashid and hosted by Olga Khazan. Editing by A.C. Valdez and Claudine Ebeid. Fact-check by Ena Alvarado. Sound design by Matthew Simonson.
