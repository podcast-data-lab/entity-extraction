Well, for our last episode of the series (don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll be back with another serving VERY soon!) The wonderful Melanie C came over for afternoon tea, for a real life, face-to-face chat &amp; it was such a treat. Melanie spoke about leaving home at 16, initially missing out on getting into the Spice Girls, being in the studio with the legendary Left Eye Lopez and how she can\u2019t resist a Tommy\u2019s Margarita. Mum made a delicious lemon drizzle cake with mashed potato (yes really) and we sipped pink champagne. What a dream.</p><br><p>Go and listen to Melanie's&nbsp;new single 'In and Out Of Love' now.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Table Manners will be back next week with a special 'Highlights' episode, and we\u2019ll see you for the next series very soon.

Johnson, a black trans woman,&nbsp;who devoted her life to fighting for equality and gay rights before being murdered.&nbsp;She was thought to be the person who threw the first brick at the Stonewall Riots in 1969.</p><br><p>This week we are proud to welcome back the wonderful &amp; long time friend of the podcast, Chris Sweeney &amp; his fantastic new Homo Sapiens co-host \u2013 the brilliant Alan Cumming. We hear all about the actor, comedian, singer, filmmaker (he does everything!!) Alan\u2019s upbringing in Scotland, eating mince &amp; tatties as a child, having his own perfume and soap line, foraging &amp; owning his own cabaret bar in New York \u2018Club Cumming'. The Homo Sapiens boys tell us what they\u2019re missing in lockdown and what they are most looking forward too when they are reunited!
