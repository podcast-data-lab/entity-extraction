Even places that say they have favorable working conditions are seeing unionization efforts. Two Trader Joe\u2019s stores, one in Massachusetts and another in Minneapolis, recently voted to unionize. With Labor Day around the corner, we speak with Sarah Beth Ryther, an employee and organizer from the Trader Joe\u2019s in Minneapolis about the reasons she and many of her co-workers wanted an independent union. Then, Jason Greer , a labor relations expert and former board agent with the NLRB, tells us how the pandemic is playing into union drives. As a board agent, he worked with employees, employers and unions to investigate allegations of unfair labor practices.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSend us your stories about work and careers!

More than 1.3 million fewer students are enrolled in colleges now than in Spring 2020, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. In a tight labor market, it may make sense to skip getting a college degree and get a job instead. But what happens when the market turns soft, and employers can be more choosy? We hear about Kiah Peschel\u2019s pandemic-driven decision to drop out of college and why she\u2019s not worried about her job prospects.

                "summary": "Most people who\u2019ve made it know: there\u2019s no success without failure. But learning how to recover and keep going after failure can be a challenge, even for seemingly successful people. Author Min Jin Lee gave up a career in law to become a professional writer, and confronted rejection, shame and her own fear of failure head-on. It took many years of struggle before her second novel Pachinko became a best-seller and was turned into an Apple TV series. She says the experience led her to believe that success and failure are the wrong metrics. Plus, sports psychologist Jonathan Fader explains how reframing our own narrative can help us move towards a growth mindset, where mistakes make us better.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSend us your best piece of career advice!
