Economic turmoil ensued once the conflict ended, with high unemployment and poverty. And the 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus left almost 4,000 people dead there. \n\nThere are physical scars from the events of those years but also scars that are less visible. \n\nThis year President Julius Maada Bio launched a Mental Health Taskforce to address the country\u2019s lack of mental health resources. The initiative is being led by Vice President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh. \n\nSo what is this Taskforce going to do? \n\nAfrica Daily\u2019s Alan Kasujja spoke to Vice President Jalloh about his government\u2019s plans."

What would you take with you?  Photos?  Letters?  A lucky charm? \n\nA group of volunteers on the Italian Island of Lampedusa have put together a collection of items lost by migrants who\u2019ve struggled to get there, often in tiny boats. The island is the closest part of Europe to Africa, but it\u2019s still a risky journey which thousands have died attempting. \n\nJust last weekend at least 29 more migrants died after their boats capsized. \n\nNow the BBC\u2019s Thomas Naadi has made a documentary \u2013 a labour of love which has taken more than a year \u2013 based on his attempt to find some of the owners of the possessions. \n\nHe spoke to Alan Kasujja for Africa Daily.\n\n@kasujja\n\n@Thomas_Naadi"

There are many African parents who see this kind of discipline as a necessary and traditional part of raising children. But there\u2019s also a younger generation of African parents who say spanking left them traumatised, unable to speak up and unable to think independently. They don\u2019t want this for their children and have decided on a different parenting style. \n\nAfrica Daily\u2019s Alan Kasujja has been looking at whether we need to rethink how we discipline children with two parents from Nigeria."

He shared his long journey living with the disease."

Sudan's economy, which had already been in crisis with high inflation and food, fuel and medicine shortages, plunged further.  Thousands of civilians took to the streets to voice their opposition to the military takeover.  \n \nBefore the coup, military and civilian leaders had been sharing power in a transitional government. This union was fragile and had been formed after mass protests in 2019, which eventually led to the end of President Omar al-Bashir\u2019s rule.\n \nSo today Alan Kasujja has been looking at how much has changed in Sudan since the military coup in 2021."

And according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Nigeria, has just 13 women amongst 360 members of its House of Representatives.\n \nSo what\u2019s stopping more women in West Africa from getting involved in politics?
