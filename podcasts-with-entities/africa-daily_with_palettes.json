                "summary": "We are looking at the state of comedy in Africa as South Sudan, a country ravaged by war and which since 2013 continues to deal with an ongoing conflict, stages its first comedy festival.\n\nTired of seeing the constant one-sided images and news stories of a war torn country with millions of people who have been displaced, and hundreds of thousands of people said to have been killed in the conflict, one man set out to try and change this world view of South Sudan. \n\nAkau Jambo, a comedian based in Juba, wanted to show the world another side \u2013 a side that shows that South Sudan too, despite everything else, can laugh and have a good time. \n\nSo Akua brought almost a dozen of comedians from across the continent to his home country and put on a show over a weekend in the beginning of April. \n\nWith a diverse cast of comedians from Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and South Africa in attendance, Mpho Lakaje speaks to Timothy Nyanzi, one the comedians who performed in Juba, about the festival but also the state of comedy in Africa.  \n \nPresenter: Mpho Lakaje (@MphoLakaje)\nGuests: Akau Jambo (@AkauJambo) and Timothy Nyanzi (@timothyjnyanzi)"

                "summary": "Many Kenyans, including the president, have been left shocked by a viral video of a woman motorist in the capital Nairobi being sexually assaulted and physically and verbally abused by a group of what\u2019s believed to be young men driving boda-bodas. \n\nBoda Bodas are the motorbike taxis often used to ferry people and goods around in East Africa. It\u2019s estimated there are at least 1.4 million bodas in Kenya, but it\u2019s thought there could be many more on Kenyan roads, with many still not registered. \n\nWith the latest incident many, including President Uhuru Kenyatta, are once again calling for fresh regulations to help reform the industry.  \n\nAlan Kasujja speaks with the BBC\u2019s reporter in Nairobi Mercy Juma, who helps us with the background and shares her experience of boda boda riders. Together they consider whether it is possible to bring effective changes to the informal public transport industry in Kenya."

The bodies were wrapped in white plastic bags and were severely burnt.  An investigation is underway to determine the cause of their death. But the incident has once again bought to the fore the problem of illegal mining in the country \u2013 an industry that costs the authorities millions of dollars in lost revenue and is extremely dangerous for those involved. In the next episode of Africa Daily Alan Kasujja has been looking at why this activity is so hard to stop.  \n\nHost: Alan Kasujja (@Kasujja on Twitter) \n\nGuest: Mpho Lakaje, South African journalist."
