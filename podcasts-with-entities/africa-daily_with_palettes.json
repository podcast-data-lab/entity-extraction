I did my Maths and Biology and Science in sign language\u201d\n\nIn May of this year, South Africa passed a law which will officially make sign language the 12th official language.\n\nThis follows intense lobbying by activists over many years.\n\nEstimates vary greatly on the number of users: from 700,000 to 2 million.\n\nThis includes hearing people who communicate with their disabled relatives, friends and colleagues.\n\nExperts say, although there are similarities, every country in Africa and the world has its own sign language, with different dialects.\n\nSo, considering the influence of western cultures and communication mediums, how can native African sign languages be developed, to ensure they don\u2019t perish?\n\nPresenter: Alan Kasujja\n\nGuests: Andiswa Gebashe and Lolie Makhubu-Badenhorst"

                "summary": "Women in Sub-Saharan Africa are twice as likely to get HIV as men. \n\nThat\u2019s why it was big news when the World Health Organisation approved a new method of HIV prevention in 2021: the dapivirine ring. \n\nIt\u2019s a silicone band that women insert vaginally and can leave in for four weeks. The ring slowly releases dapivirine, an anti-retroviral drug that stops HIV in its tracks. \n\nIt\u2019s been hailed as a game changer, but two years after the ring was approved, fewer than a thousand woman globally are using in. Those who can\u2019t get it are starting to get frustrated. \n\nSo why are African governments so slow to introduce this new method of HIV prevention? When will women be able to access the dapivirine ring? \n\nPresenter: Mpho Lakaje\nGuests: Shakirah Namwanje and Patriciah Jeckonoviah"

The government say this is about positioning America to drive the electric vehicle future forward, outcompeting China, and tackling the climate crisis. \n\nIt\u2019s a message which puts Africa in a unique position.   \n\nZambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo have large reserves of copper and cobalt, two crucial components needed to make the batteries for electric vehicles. DRCongo is currently the world\u2019s top producer of cobalt.  \n\nAfrica Daily\u2019s Alan Kasujja has been looking at whether this all represents an opportunity or risk for the continent."

Africa or Europe?\n \nPresenter: Mpho Lakaje\n \nGuests: Lungile Mashele, James Mnyupe and Fausi Najjar"

The Big Brother franchise, one of the first reality TV programmes in the world, has been on-going on the continent for decades. \n\nSo with shows like The Real Housewives of Lagos, Durban, Cape Town and the recent Netflix hit, Young, Famous and African, showing the opulent lives of rich Africans, is this the golden age of glitzy and glamourous African reality shows? \n\nHost: Alan Kasujja \n\nGuests: Peace Hyde, Young, Famous and African co-creator and Tosin Ajibade, founder of media house Olori Super Gal"

The M23 rebel group has escalated its attacks, leading the East Africa Community to sanction a regional force to help DRC forces to repel the rebels. Kenya has committed 1,000 soldiers, it\u2019s a deployment which will cost the Kenyan taxpayer 37 million dollars in a year. But is it worth it? And can the East Africa Community finally bring peace to DRC? \n\nAfrica Daily\u2019s Alan Kasujja has been speaking to East Africa Security expert Sylvanus Wekesa."

The plight of passengers suddenly forced to find creative and expensive ways to travel thousands of miles  grabbed the world\u2019s attention \u2013 and within days of the crisis, Nigeria said it would release some of the money owed to foreign airlines: $265 million.\n \nBut the reason WHY the airline took the drastic step actually highlights a more widespread problem for Nigeria: a shortage of dollars to pay for foreign services \u2013 and two competing exchange rates: the official rate and what Nigerians can get on the black market.\n \nThis has left the Central Bank of Nigeria \u2013 or CBN \u2013 technically subsidising travellers \u2013 and foreign companies being underpaid for their services.\n \nFor Africa Daily, @kasujja speaks with Oluwatosin Olaseinde, an account and money expert who set up Money Africa, a financial literacy platform.\n \n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a higher cost of living, you\u2019re seeing a reduction in the revenue of the government, so it\u2019s just a whole lot of different (elements) mixed together in this dance.\u201d"

                "summary": "In June 2022, the US Supreme court overturned \u201cRoe v Wade\u201d, a landmark case which legalised abortion in 1973. \n\nIt came after a young woman challenged the criminal abortion laws in Texas. Her case was heard on appeal in the US Supreme Court. \n\nThe court ruled that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US constitution.\n\nBut now nearly 50 years later, America\u2019s most senior legal body has overturned that right, which means laws in individual states will now determine whether women have access to abortion. \n\nThere has been a huge reaction to the decision in the US and around the world, including on the continent. \n\nBut should US court decision matter to people in Africa? What impact could it have on the debate on abortion on the continent? \n\nHost: Alan Kasujja \n\nGuests: Rhoda Odhiambo, BBC correspondent Ann Kioko, anti-abortion campaigner at Citizengo Nelly Munyasia, Reproductive Health Network in Kenya Mallah Tabot, International Planned Parenthood Federation Africa"

By mid-April last year, the value of one bitcoin peaked at $60,000 US. But In the last seven months, the highly volatile online currency has lost more than 60% of its value, leaving the value of a coin at less than $25,000.\n \nSo are African governments right in warning people off?  Or should they just regulate the trade better? \n \nFor Africa Daily, Alan Kasujja takes a breath and deep dives into the murky and often confusing world of crypto with the help of Kabenda Belete, a cryptocurrency consultant and trader based in Tanzania.\n\nPresenter: Alan Kasujja (@kasujja)\nGuest: Kabenda Belete (@lukaskabenda)"
