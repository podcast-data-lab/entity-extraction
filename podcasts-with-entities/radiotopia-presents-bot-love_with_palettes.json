But the LGBT community are fighting back - with a #KilltheBill campaign.

This week, we revisit Secrets, a six-part series from 2018. When released, Secrets offered listeners a compelling mix of autobiography, private admissions ranging from espionage to photography fraud, and storytelling traditions from Sweden and the U.S.. Three years later, producers and hosts Mohamed El Abed and Martin Johnson lift the curtain to share the secrets behind Secrets: how they get people to tell private stories of their lives and what\u2019s happened since Mohamed shared this part of his family\u2019s story.\u00a0\n\n\nBehind the Series is hosted, written, and produced by Mark Pag\u00e1n. Executive producers are Audrey Mardavich and Julie Shapiro. Music from JD Samson and Blue Dot Sessions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBehind the Series is a production of Showcase, from PRX\u2019s Radiotopia.

                "summary": "\n        Secrets is a show about the secrets we all carry inside of us. When Mohamed El Abed found out that he had a secret sister, it was 25 years before he could start putting the pieces together. Across six episodes of Secrets, you\u2019ll hear Mohamed\u2019s story, and meet both people who live every day with a significant lie, and people affected by the lies of others.\n\nHow is it to live with a secret that no one can know about? What happens when that secret is exposed? In episode one we meet Neil Woods who, as an undercover policeman in the UK, pretended to be a heroin addict for 14 years while he had a wife and two children back home.\n\nSecrets is produced and hosted by Mohamed El Abed and Martin Johnson, with additional reporting by \u00c5sa Secher, from the Swedish production company, Soundtelling. Executive producer is Julie Shapiro. Artwork is by Sepidar Hosseini, and music is by Min stora sorg.\n\nSecrets is a production of Showcase, from PRX\u2019s Radiotopia.
