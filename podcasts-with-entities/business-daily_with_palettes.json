He visits one museum in the north-west of England attempting to decolonise its collection by returning thousands of items to the countries and communities they were taken from. \n\nIn this episode we meet curators like Dr Njabulo Chipangura, from Manchester Museum, who says the best way to guarantee the future of collections is to give parts of them away. Also, Professor Kim A. Wagner from the University of London tells us the story of the skull of Alum Bheg, which he would dearly like to return to India. \n\nIs this ultimately the right way to treat problematic artefacts and treasures? Or could this movement end up destroying hard to acquire expertise and render Museums meaningless and economically unviable?\n\nProducer/presenter: David Reid\n\n(Photo: The skull of Alum Bheg: Credit: Kim Wagner)"

Kasim Kutay, CEO of the investment fund Novo Holdings tells us that for big pharma companies, antibiotics are seen as a contribution to society rather than an investment that can provide a profit. \n\nHow can firms be convinced to invest in an unprofitable product? We hear how Netflix might provide a good model and we explore research in Phages - a bacteria specialised in eating other bacteria. Phages are being championed by some as a potential substitute for antibiotics. One patient in Minnesota tells us Phages saved his life.\n\nPresenter / producer: Stefania Gozzer\nImage: Dr Tina Joshi; Credit: Lloyd Russell"

And we hear from Kenyan film maker and musician Maia Lekow. She records on vinyl but can't find anywhere in Kenya to press the vinyl itself -  she's ended up doing it in Australia. \n\nSome smaller independent labels tell us they're struggling to get records pressed. Andy Black owns the Popty Ping Recording company in Wales and says there's now a delay and they need to plan a lot more in advance, which can be hard when bands want to release new music. \n\nPresenter: David Harper\nProducers: David Harper and Victoria Hastings\n\n(Photo: GZ Media pressing plant.

Alvaro Lario explains how food shortages often begin with smallholder farmers. The failure of their crops and livestock means farmers are often left struggling to feed themselves and this then affects entire communities. Lario also discusses his vision for how private finance and multilateral institutions can team up and to avert the worst in the coming 12 months.\n\nProducer/presenter: Frey Lindsay\n\n(Image: Farming fields.

In 2021 they signed a ground breaking deal with TikTok to show every home game. And we hear from TikTok themselves \u2013 Rich Waterworth, General Manager for the UK and Europe explains what\u2019s in it for them. \n\nSue Anstiss is the author of Game On: The unstoppable rise of women\u2019s sport. She tells us fans of all sports are consuming content differently now, and if women\u2019s sport gets it right, there could be a big opportunity in the digital market. \n\nAnd Haley Rosen, founder and CEO of digital media company Just Women\u2019s Sports explains her frustration at trying to set up a business in a growing marketplace which is lacking in investment and infrastructure. \n\nPresenter: Sam Fenwick \nProducer: Helen Thomas \n(Image: Burnley FC Women in December 2021.

But how much do those young, impressionable players know about personal finance? \n\nWe've all seen the stories of high profile players blowing their fortunes and ending up bankrupt, and players in the English Premier League can expect wages of around $10million a year. \n\nIn this episode we hear from two former footballers who now help others manage their money. Swedish footballer, Philip Haglund tells Sam Fenwick how difficult it is not to spend on expensive items when the first pay cheque comes in, and former Manchester United and France International, Louis Saha, explains why players can be overwhelmed by how much they earn and what he\u2019s doing to try and help current and former athletes manage their finances better.\n\nPresenter/producer: Sam Fenwick\n(Photo: Cody Gakpo of Netherlands vies with Tyler Adams of USA.

Speaking to Sam Fenwick, Flamini reveals what he learnt from top football managers and how that knowledge has helped him perform in the boardroom. \n\nThe former Arsenal, AC Milan and Olympique de Marseille player tells us he grew up by the sea and constantly seeing plastic washed up on the shore made him aware of sustainability and climate change. He says as a youngster he had two ambitions in life, to play professional football and become an environmentalist. \n\nIn 2008, while still playing top flight football, Flamini co-founded, GFBiochemicals.

                "summary": "Confederation of African Football, CAF, with the backing of FIFA, has launched a new Super League aimed at injecting much-needed funds to clubs on the continent. CAF President Dr Patrice Motsepe promised that the tournament, due to start in 2023, would financially transform African football with $100 million on offer in prize money alone. But, as Ivana Davidovic finds out, there are more questions than answers for many involved in the game on the continent.\n\nThe owner of Cape Town City, John Comitis, says that they are in the dark about how the new competition would work in practice and that South African Premier Soccer League, where they were the runners-up last season, would be badly affected by the new Super League.\n\nNigerian football journalist and the former member of the dissolved FIFA Task Force Against Racism, Osasu Obayiuwana is worried that there are no clear plans where the money would come from for the Super League nor how teams could travel regularly across the vast continent. He also warns that a big problem would be the lack of interest in pan-African club tournaments from broadcasters and sponsors, as it is difficult for many Africans to regularly follow on TV what is happening in football leagues across the continent.\n\nHowever, the legendary South African striker, UEFA Champions League winner and the current Manchester United first team coach Benni McCarthy believes that the Super League would boost standards across Africa, helping young players compete with the best from around the world.\n\nProduced and presented by Ivana Davidovic\n\n(Image: Mohamed el-Shenawy holds the winner's trophy after the CAF Super Cup Final between El Ahly and Raja Casablanca at Al Rayyan Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar on December 22, 2021.

Some of Europe's well known suppliers boasted up to a 400% increase in sales compared to 2019. Companies simply could not get a hold on enough stock. In China on/off lockdowns caused a part shortage. Waiting lists across Europe went as far as six months. Some of the world's biggest tub producers made record profits.\n\nThen in early 2022 an industry went from its heyday to doomsday in a matter of months. The reason: The cost of electricity. Across Europe, some owners are draining their pools as the cost of living crisis bites.

                "summary": "Now that borders have opened up post pandemic, backpackers have been slow to return to Australia.\n\nDespite a number of initiatives, the number of travellers is low. And that\u2019s having an impact on businesses who need staff.\n\nDavid Reid explores the Australian working holiday visa scheme, which was set up fifty years ago to encourage young people to travel and work. It's not been without problems, and recently there have been allegations of exploitation and even abuse.\n\nSo is the visa scheme the right solution for the Australian labour crunch? Or should government step in and rethink the whole set up?\n\nDavid speaks to Lee Thurston who runs Miss Moneypenny\u2019s restaurant in Noosa, on the east coast of Queensland. Lee is from the UK but has settled in Australia.  Lee said when they came to open up after the pandemic, all the backpackers had gone home. So he\u2019s had to train up local teenagers instead.\n\nHamish Hill runs Nomad\u2019s hostel in Noosa. He tells David it\u2019s noticeable how many vacancies there are and the impact that\u2019s happening. He\u2019d like fewer regulations on backpackers.\n\nProfessor Stephen Howes, director of the development policy centre at the Australian National University, explains how the visa scheme works, and how it\u2019s changed from its original intention. \n\nAnd David visits a small farm run by Joe Lyons, who has 50 hectares growing avocados and macadamias in Bundaburg near Queensland. He and other farmers are rethinking their reliance on backpackers. They\u2019re currently staffed by 100% Australian labour.\n\nPresenter/producer: David Reid\n\n(Photo: Fruit picking.

                "summary": "The global events industry was valued at more than $1.1 billion in 2019, before the start of the covid-19 pandemic. Live music and concert events alone lost $30 billion in 2020 and most outdoor festivals were cancelled. This year, in 2022, with more people vaccinated around the world, many festivals have managed to return but are having to cope with rising prices and staff shortages, as well as people with less cash to spend. \n\nMonica Newton, the CEO of the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown, South Africa, tells us about the challenges she's faced in holding this year's event. The director of the Great British Food Festival in the UK, Daniel Maycock, says they've managed to avoid putting up ticket prices so far and are trying to support smaller businesses. \n\nLisa Louis travels to the Rock en Seine festival, to the west of the French capital Paris to speak to the director, Matthieu Ducos, about how he's had to adapt. She speaks to food and drinks vendors about how they're coping with rising prices and festival goers about how they're dealing with having less money in their pockets. \n\n\nPresenter: Emb Hashmi\nReporter: Lisa Louis\nProducer: Jo Critcher\n\n(Image: Matthieu Ducos, director of the Rock en Seine festival, Parc de Saint-Cloud; Credit: BBC)"

So how have these brands managed to survive for so long? \n\nDavid Reid explores why some brands outlive their founders by more than a century.\n\nDavid speaks to Harold Osborn, CEO of McIlhenny Company which makes Tabasco. \n\nPatrick Barwise, emeritus professor of management and marketing at London Business School explains what happened when Coca Cola tried to 'tweak' their recipe.\n\nSamir Nanji, spokesperson at KraftHeinz who now own Lea and Perrins, explains the history of the sauce - and how an early batch didn't go too well.\n\nAnd Jake Burger, cocktail expert from Portabello Road Gin and The Ginstitute explains how Angostura Bitters outlasted prohibition to become a bar staple.\n\n(Image: Tabasco sauce bottle.

                "summary": "Skateboarding is one of the fastest growing sports in the world; it was included for the first time in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in Japan. It's becoming  increasingly popular among women and girls, but it does come with a price tag.  \n\nHannah Mullane speaks to Boipelo Awuah, one of only two female African athletes to qualify to compete in skateboarding at the Tokyo Olympics. Wendy Gila, the head of the South African Roller Sports Association, gives us her insight into how much it costs to make a sport like skateboarding accessible to everyone. \n\nMark Sedgwick meets Thato Moet, Founder of IslandGals, a girls only skate group in Johannesburg. She gives her perspective on what it\u2019s like to be a female skater in South Africa.  We\u2019ll also hear from Pieter Retief, who helps to build skateparks all over the world and explains how they help to bring together communities.\n \nPresenter and producer: Hannah Mullane \nReporter and producer: Mark Sedgwick \n\nImage: Girls skating in Soweto; Credit: BBC"
