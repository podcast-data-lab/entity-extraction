It's estimated to be one of the biggest brands in the world, steeped in history, tradition and of course scandal... \n\nIn the Queen's Platinum Jubilee year we look at how recent events have changed things for the royal brand and what coming changes and challenges could mean going forward. Pauline McLaran, professor of marketing and consumer research at Royal Holloway University and co-author of Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture explains how this multi-faceted brand actually functions and what she thinks are the biggest problems it faces. \n\nWe'll also explore whether being associated with brand Royal is still good for business. Jason Bell is a photographer based in New York. He took the photographs of Prince George\u2019s christening and tells us about the media interest in him being linked with that job and the global response to his pictures.

Governor of the bank of Russia Elvia Nabiullina says the brooches she wears contain clues to understanding policy decisions, and the late Madeleine Albright, former USA Secretary of State, used to wear them as a diplomatic tool.\n\nBrooches are currently gaining popularity among consumers and fashion brands are taking note, as Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s Carlos Palacios and British Vogue\u2019s Carol Woolton tell us.\n\nPaul Paradis, an art historian from L\u2019ECOLE School of Jewellery Arts in Paris, takes us through the history of brooches, and jewellery historian Vivienne Becker tells us what it was like to work with Madeleine Albright, and help pen her novel Read My Pins.\n\nAnd we speak to Cindy Chao, one of the world\u2019s most famous brooch makers, who became the first Asian female to get her work inducted into the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nPresenter: Vivienne Nunis\nProducer: Izzy Greenfield\n\n(Photo:  Lady Gaga at the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States.

Brant Stewart, the founder of Mavia Bakery in Beirut, explains how he's found a solution in growing and milling his own wheat - as well as helping local women.\n\nRami Zurayk, the Director of the Food Security programme at the American University of Beirut, tells us he believes Lebanese people need to be less reliant on bread in their diet. \n\nPresenter: Anna Foster\nProducer: Jo Critcher\n\n(Picture: Women at work in Mavia Bakery; Credit: Maria Klenner, photographer)"

Shamim Nabuuma Kaliisa, the founder of CHIL-AI, tells Jo Critcher how she was inspired by her own experience of cancer to use drones to give more women in Uganda access to screening.\n\nIn Sweden, the CEO of Everdrone, Mats S\u00e4llstr\u00f6m, describes how drones are being used to quickly transport life-saving equipment to emergency situations. \n\nThere are more challenges to using drones in smaller, more densely populated countries like the UK but Elliot Parnham, the CEO of the drone operator Skyfarer, says he believes they can be overcome. His company is starting a pilot scheme to help the NHS transport critical medical supplies. \n\nPresenter/Producer: Jo Critcher\n\n(Photo: PWOne drone; Credit: Skyfarer Ltd.)"

After the UK government imposed sanctions on Russian owner Roman Abramovich, the club has been denied access to the funds that enabled investment in some of the world's best players and helped it become one of the biggest clubs in European football. No income, either, from ticket or merchandise sales can be made by the club, throwing its short term future into doubt. It's unclear whether Chelsea can even pay its squad and staff next month, such is the punishing nature of the sanctions put upon Mr Abramovich over his ties to the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So how will this play out on and off the pitch? We speak to Kieran Maguire who lectures in football finance at the Liverpool University; Justine Walker, an anti-money-laundering compliance specialist based in the UK; Jai McIntosh, a sports writer and Chelsea fan and former Chelsea player Pat Nevin. The programme is presented by Ed Butler and is produced by Elizabeth Hotson and Russell Newlove.\n\nPicture: Chelsea FC's crest Credit:PA",

                "summary": "On Business Weekly this week, as the fighting in parts of Ukraine intensified, a suite of sanctions has been levied on Russia, cutting off the country from the inter-bank messaging system Swift and restricting access to the foreign reserves Russia holds in the West\u2019s central banks. Many large international companies are scaling down their businesses in Russia, including the oil giants BP and Shell. The global shipping giant Maersk is stopping its ships from docking at Russian ports. Chris Weafer, chief executive of Macro Advisory and a 24-year resident of Moscow tells us what life is like for ordinary Russians. Meanwhile, author and journalist Oliver Bullough tell us how badly the oligarchs will be hit by the sanctions. We also look at the impact of the conflict on Russian and Ukrainian grain exports, particularly for countries in Africa and Southeast Asia that already suffer from food insecurity.

But when it comes to those creating them, there\u2019s a huge gender disparity.\n\nWe hear from two female artists - Michele Pred in Oakland and Yiying Lu from San Francisco - plus Liana Zavo who runs her own PR and marketing company. Women make up just 16% of all NFT artists - according to ArtTactic, a London-based company that focuses on research and data in the world of art. Anders Petterson from the group explains why. Plus Maliha Abidi, an artist, author and activist, and the creator of Women Rise NFT, says she\u2019s determined to make a change.\n \nPresenter: Tamasin Ford\nProducer: Sarah Treanor\n\n(Picture: A woman looks at a NFT by Larva Labs titled \"CryptoPunk 7523\"; Credit: Timothy A Clary/AFP via Getty Images)"

We take a look at why the world\u2019s third largest economy has one of the strictest border controls in the world. How is it affecting people? And how is it affecting the economy? Tamasin Ford goes on a virtual tour of Tokyo\u2019s foodie hotspots with Yukari Sakamoto, writer, chef and the author of a book called Food Sake Tokyo. Yukari explains how a lack of tourists has impacted her business, and how travel bans have stopped her from seeing family and friends. We also hear from a student stuck in the UK, and from Seijiro Takeshita. Professor of Management and Information at the University of Shizuoka Japan about the concerns from some big business over continued isolation. \n\n(Image: Women cross a street at night, in Tokyo on November 3, 2021.

Speedboats, tunnels, even catapults have been deployed to get methamphetamine and fentanyl into the US.\n\nAnd that's not all. The cartels have diversified, into people smuggling, wildcat mining and crude oil theft among other things, according to the Mexico-based author and journalist Ioan Grillo. And they aren't the only ones. In Brazil, a narcotics gang called First Capital Command has become so powerful that they have effectively replaced the government in some parts of the country, according to Marcos Alan Ferreira of the Federal University of Paraiba.\n\n(Picture: Mexican Federal Police officers patrol Iguala, Guerrero state, Mexico; Credit: Yuri Cortez/AFP via Getty Images)"

This little pouch has a lot to say about gender roles and a woman\u2019s right to financial independence. We hear about the great divide in pocket designs that has existed for hundreds of years with Ariane Fennetaux, author of The Pocket: A Hidden History of Women's Lives, 1660\u20131900. We take a trip to London\u2019s V&A Museum to see how pockets \u2013 or a lack of them \u2013 led to the billion-dollar handbag industry, and we hear from Indian fashion designer and founder of the Meri Pocket campaign group, Taarini Saraf on the fight for pocket justice.

But with so many young people leaving rural areas for jobs in China's manufacturing centres, those ancient skills are disappearing. Angel Chang tells us how she quit her job in the designer fashion houses of New York to start her own clothing line, employing indigenous craftspeople to grow organic cotton, use natural dyes and sew her collection by hand. It\u2019s part of a wider shift away from the highly-polluting fast fashion industry. We also hear from Nicole Rycroft, founder of the NGO Canopy, which is changing the way popular brands source the world's third most popular fabric: viscose, which is traditionally made from the wood-pulp of trees. Vivienne Nunis asks if this more environmental approach can be adopted by the wider fashion industry. Producer: Sarah Treanor.

In the face of a climate catastrophe, the Austrian and Welsh governments are reconsidering plans to expand their road networks, moving away from a car-first model to better include more environmentally modes of transport. In Wales, they\u2019ve all but halted any new roads as Climate Minister Julie James tells us, and are instead looking at improving public transport and active travel measures. In Austria we speak to Leonore Gewessler, Minister for Climate Action in the national government, who says that to build more roads would only attract more traffic and therefore more pollution.

The BBC's Rebecca Kesby speaks to Ged Swinton, a member of the Royal College of Nursing who had to leave his job as a frontline nurse after losing patience with an unappreciative government - and abuse from the public.

In the USA we hear from Vicki Good,  former president of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, who tells us people are leaving the care sector almost as soon as they join, despite spending years in training beforehand. We speak to Lori Peters of the National Association of Health Care Assistants, who says that without decent pay and conditions, the sector won't attract enough workers to fill a skills gap that will only get bigger.\n\nThis episode is produced by Russell Newlove, Sarah Hawkins and Elizabeth Hotson.",

Instead, richer countries race to give booster vaccines to their own populations as many poorer countries are still waiting to receive their first jabs.  \n\nTamasin Ford hears from Dr. Richard Mihigo, who coordinates the WHO\u2019s immunisation and vaccine development progamme in Africa. He says it\u2019s not just about shipping jabs to countries; the international community could also step up to help with planning and logistics for the distribution of vaccines. Dr. Atiya Mosam, a public health specialist in South Africa, was disappointed in the way the world reacted when news the new variant came out of her country. She argues that the travel bans that many countries quickly imposed are both discriminatory and ineffective.

Dr Meru Sheel, an epidemiologist at the Australian National University, says the issue of vaccine inequality should have been fixed many months ago. She says the vaccines should evenly distributed because it makes the most sense from a public health perspective, and also because it\u2019s the ethical thing to do.  \n\n(Image: Passengers at Cape Town airport in South Africa on 29 November 2021.

                "summary": "Authoritarian regimes are working closer than ever to keep each other afloat - with plenty of help from the West's financial system.\n\nEd Butler speaks to Frank Vogl, who helped found the global anti-corruption organisation Transparency International. He claims that the world's kleptocrats are enabled by an army of bankers, lawyers and accountants who are helping them squirrel away their ill-gotten money in Western real estate and investments.\n\nAnd for regimes like those of Belarus, Venezuela or Syria, who find their power contested by their own people and their economies in tatters, there is plenty of support to be found these days from other authoritarians - chief among them Russia and China. That's according to the historian, journalist and author Anne Applebaum. The questions is whether the world's democracies will ever get their act together and do something about it?\n\n(Picture: Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro (left) embracing Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko; Credit: Sergei Gapon/AFP via Getty Images)"

                "summary": "The Amazon is the world's largest rainforest but this crucial carbon sink is facing increased deforestation. Land clearing for mining or agriculture has increased under Brazil's president Jair Bolsanaro. But the world needs the Amazon jungle to keep absorbing carbon if more ambitious climate goals are to be met. Is there a place for the private sector to step in where governments have failed? Vivienne Nunis hears from economist Nat Keohane about a new not-for-profit called Emergent. It acts as a kind of middle man, connecting tropical forests with corporations searching for ways to cancel out their emissions. Can it work? Also on the programme, journalist Karla Mendes explains how many Brazilians feel about the Amazon's plight, while Robert Muggah from the Igarap\u00e9 Institute tells us companies such as Google have stepped up to help with deforestation mapping, when government agencies had their budgets cut.

Although insects are consumed by more than two billion people worldwide, acceptance of them in the Western diet is still low, but could that be changing? With climate change, a growing population and an increased demand for protein all putting pressure on our food system, insects offer an interesting and more planet friendly alternative to meat and fish. Malena Sigurgeirsdottir is the co-founder of Hey Planet which has just launched a meat substitute using buffalo beetle powder (that's the lesser mealworm or Alphitobius Diaperinus), in Denmark, Germany and Sweden. She tells us how great insects taste, especially when they're ground up. Professor Matan Shelomi, from National Taiwan University, Department of Entomology outlines how farming insects can have a much lower carbon foot-print than farming animals. Meanwhile in the UK, Kieran Olivares Whittaker has received millions of dollars in funding for his Entocycle project, researching the optimum way to farm black soldier fly larvae to feed fish and poultry instead of using soy and fishmeal which causes deforestation and overfishing. And we meet Aly Moore of Bugible who makes a living from eating and promoting bugs as a source of protein.\nProduced and presented by Clare Williamson.\n(Image credit: HeyPlanet burger; Credit: Hey-Planet.com)",

Konza CEO John Tanui says the project is on track but Kenyan writer Carey Baraka isn\u2019t convinced. Picture: An artist\u2019s impression of the planned Akon City in Senegal.

                "summary": "The fight to succeed popular German chancellor Angela Merkel could not be tighter. In late July the country\u2019s climate policies shot to the top of the political agenda in the wake of devastating, and deadly, floods across western Germany. The BBC\u2019s Victoria Craig and Stephen Ryan travelled to one of the hardest-hit towns, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, to see how the locals are trying to recover. Local shop-owner Martina Kleinow says she and many others are still waiting for financial support to rebuild, while Anne Gluck of the regional chamber of commerce, explains the myriad challenges businesses face. Elsewhere in the country, we\u2019ll hear about projects to build better resilience against climate events. Ulrich Lemke leads a port revitalization project at Offenbach am Main, and explains how public works can better account for neighbouring waterways, while Gerhard Hauber of the engineering consultancy Ramboll, explains how coordination is the key to building true resilience.\n\nProducers: Stephen Ryan, Philippa Goodrich.\n\n(Photo: The bank of the river Ahr, in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

                "summary": "Gaisu fled the Taliban when she was 18. Now she's fleeing again. Speaking to the BBC's Tamasin Ford, Gaisu recounts being engaged to the son of a local warlord at age 6, fleeing to the United States at 18, and then returning as a civil servant after the Taliban were toppled. She recounts her time as the only female journalist at a local radio station as a teenager, how she butted heads with the Taliban and how her mother inspired her to be a feminist from a young age. We'll also hear how in the post-Taliban era Gaisu worked to get more women into public and government roles. And she tells Tamasin how she feels now, seeing the country come fully under Taliban rule once again, and women once again disappearing into the margins of society.\n\n(Image credit: A woman in Afghanistan in 1996.

Is it an issue with patents and intellectual property rights? Is big pharma standing in the way? Or is it simply about money and profits?\n\nThings are beginning to happen. Last month a consortium was set up with the aim of opening an mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa. If they succeed it will be the first regional mRNA vaccine manufacturing production facility in Africa. \n\nIn this edition of Business Daily, Tamasin Ford hears from Marie-Paule Kieny, the chair of the Governance Board of the Medicines Patent Pool, Toyin Abiodun from the Tony Blair Global Institute for Change, based in Rwanda, and from Petro Terblanche, the Managing Director of Afrigen, the South African biotech company where the first African vaccines will hopefully be produced.\n\n(Producer: Joshua Thorpe)\n\n(Image: Health workers prepare a dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine during a mass vaccination campaign against the Covid-19, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Despite delaying the games by a year, the authorities have still been forced to hold the games without spectators, as Covid cases rise. Seijiro Takeshita at the University of Shizuoka explains why the Japanese were hoping for a  successful Olympics, and why it\u2019s now become so controversial. Also in the programme, we\u2019ll hear from a number of businesses affected by the lack of tourists. And Yoko Ishikura, Professor Emeritus at Hitotsubashi University, describes how big sponsors have resisted pressure from the Tokyo government not to withdraw support for the games.\n\n(Picture: The logo for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.

But huge controversy is brewing over a new type of super shoe which has led to a recent surge in track and field records. Ivana Davidovic asks whether runners' ability is becoming less and less important for success on the track? And what does that do the sport?\n\nUS Olympian Mason Ferlic is worried that this is creating a division between the haves and the have nots and thinks that World Athletics should pander less to big brands and tighten regulation on running shoes.\nCanadian Olympian Madeleine Kelly talks about the unprecedented situation when rival brands allowed their sponsored athletes to run in Nike's super spikes, which are widely regarded as ahead of the pack at the moment.\n\nBut they are not the only ones. Technology used to assist disabled athletes is now propelling their able-bodied counterparts to new heights. Running coach and former World Athletics official Peter Thompson - who also worked in shoe development for Nike and Hoka - says we are nowhere near the limit to where materials can go. He also sees these super shoes as \"mechanical doping.\" While professor of sports innovation Mike Caine warns that to limit innovation would be a commercial disaster for any sport, as viewers and sponsors are attracted by tumbling records.\n\n(Photo: Male sprinter starts from blocks in athletics stadium.

Ed Butler speaks to Laurence Halsted, a former British Olympic Fencer who wrote about his concerns about the Games in Rio de Janeiro, in 2016. Sports marketing consultant Tim Crow says the involvement of people's politics in sport makes the usual bonanza for sponsors at events a lot more problematic. Martyn Ziegler, chief sports reporter at The Times, thinks the Olympics may find itself under growing pressure as players blur the messages that brands and governments are hoping to promote.\n\nProduced by Benjie Guy. \n\n(Picture: Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo at a Euro 2020 press conference.

Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested into searching for signs of alien intelligence. Ed Butler speaks to Lisa Kaltenegger, an astronomer at Cornell University, who has analysed the closest, most likely planets to support alien life. If, or when, we do make contact what could we trade with our new neighbours? David Brin, a science fiction writer and astro-physicist says our culture would be the most easily exchanged aspect of our civilisation. And what about making money on Earth from the continued interest in aliens? Juanita Jennings is the public affairs director for the town of Roswell, New Mexico. The site of the most famous UFO sighting. \n\n(Picture: a UFO over the Mojave desert, USA. Credit: Getty Images.)"

We\u2019ll also hear from Guy Ryder, Director-General of the International Labour Organisation, about how the pandemic could exacerbate inequality around the world. At the same time, Mamta Murthi of the World Bank breaks down how progress for young women in the workplace could be rolled back by decades. Finally, Daniel Susskind from Oxford University, explains why those lost jobs might never come back.\n\nProducer: Frey Lindsay\n\n(Image credit: Getty Creative)",

                "summary": "Faster price rises are coming as countries recover from the pandemic. But how painful will it be for consumers and the global economy? Mohamed El-Erian, economic adviser and president of Queens' College, Cambridge, thinks central banks are already behind the curve when it comes to keeping inflation in check. Others believe the pandemic's impact on prices is largely temporary. Dana Peterson of the US Conference Board explains why. We also hear from restaurant owner Luke Garnsworthy. Now that England's third lockdown has mostly lifted, customers are itching to spend and he can't find enough staff for his kitchens. But, he says raising prices and wages isn't an option for him.\n\nPicture: stock photo of a sad piggy bank and stack of coins (Credit: Getty)"
