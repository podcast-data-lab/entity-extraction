In this programme we find out how. \n\nChris Warburton meets the creative team from Dundee in Scotland who came up with the concept for Grand Theft Auto 25 years ago. We look into how it was picked up, marketed and ultimately sold to millions and millions of us. \n\nGrand Theft Auto was revolutionary, but it was also controversial with its depictions of shocking, graphic violence. This is the story of how the game and its makers overcame moral panic, political opposition and naysayers to become one of the most successful entertainment brands of a generation.\n\nPresenter: Chris Warburton\nProducer: Ciaran Tracey\nImage: GTA: Credit: Getty Images"

Skukhna offers a global cuisine and brings communities together through exotic dining.\n\nSimona Simulyte is a serial entrepreneur and CEO Tech4Good. She runs an ecosystem in Lithuania that brings together people with ideas for social businesses, provides mentorship and help source for funds which enables these start-ups become self-sufficient. \n\nAnd Moses Onitilo is the co-founder of a company known as Jamborow - a blockchain driven fintech platform focused on financial inclusion and grassroot empowerment, specifically targeting the unbanked and the lower income and rural communities within Africa. \n\nThe Jamborow eco-system cuts across seven African countries including Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Botswana, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda\n\nPresenter/producer Peter MacJob\n\n(Image: These members of a small savings group in Kenya now have access to e-wallets via mobile phones.

Demand has been rising, particularly since the start of the coronavirus pandemic as people look for an alternative to crowded public transport. Concern for climate change and rising fuel prices have also helped to push people onto bikes.\n \nPortugal is the biggest bicycle manufacturer in Europe.

Or stay and help rebuild?\n \nVictoria Craig travels to Ankara where she meets Berkay, a second year design student from Gaziantep, one of the most badly affected cities. He drove for 12 hours with his family to reach the Turkish capital. He says he's not sure what the future holds, and he is considering moving to another European country.\n \nRoger Kelly is the lead regional economist for Turkey at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He explains how youth unemployment is a particular challenge for southern Turkey, and says it's difficult to say whether people who have been displaced will return when areas are rebuilt.\n \nAnd Professor G\u00fcne\u015f A\u015f\u0131k from TOBB Economics and Technical University says students affected by the earthquake might not find it that easy - they might have to drop out of university to support their families.\n \nProduced and presented by Victoria Craig.

He got a job in Dublin in January 2022 and was worried about moving there because he heard about the housing horror stories. \n\nAnd finally, Norman Shapiro, senior mortgage broker with First Israel Mortgages, gives us the view from Israel, where house prices have hit a record 20% year-on-year increase.\n\nPresenter/producer: Leanna Byrne\n(Image: Houses/ Getty Images)"

Africa's middlemen divide opinion on whether they are predatory rent-seekers or invisible but ever present cultural brokers who are actually crucial to the economy.\n\nWe hear from local businessman Bola Omololu - based in Abeokuta, southwest Nigeria, and Tony Alabi an architect also based in Nigeria, in the commercial capital of Lagos. They share their experiences of interacting with middlemen.\n\nCocoa farmer Dimeji Green holds middlemen directly responsible for the dire conditions of farmers in the multi-billion pounds industry whilst Josephine Favre of the African association of vertical farming thinks middlemen are actually necessary for the economy to thrive.\n\nPresenter / producer: Peter MacJob\n \nImage: Bolarinwa Omololu; Credit: Bolarinwa Omololu"

Sophie Clarke, who\u2019s selling her tub on a European forum tells us how upset she is to see it go and we hear from international hot tub supplier Christina Mantoura Clarke on how her business survived when so many competitors went bust.\n\nPresented and Produced by Rick Kelsey\n\n(Image: A man and child in a hot tub.

                "summary": "The use of robots in North American workplaces has increased by 40% since the start of the pandemic and the small to medium sized businesses, which never automated before, are getting in on the act. The robotics industry has responded to the global increased demand by creating more and more customisable robots, which can be leased or hired. \n\nIvana Davidovic explores what effect this has had - and could have in the future - on the labour markets, innovation, but also on social inequality. \n\nIvana hears from a small restaurant owner from California who wouldn't be without her server robot Rosie any more, after months of being unable to fill vacancies. Joe Campbell from the Danish company Universal Robots and Tim Warrington from the British company Bots explain how they are taking advantage of the post-pandemic \"great resignation\" and which industries are next in line for a robotics boom. \n\nKaren Eggleston from Stanford University explains her research into the consequences of the use of robots in over 800 nursing homes in Japan and Daron Acemoglu from MIT discusses whether robots in workplaces will liberate their human colleagues or simply entrench inequality. \n\nPresented and produced by Ivana Davidovic \n\n(Photo: Robot waitress serving dessert and coffee on a tray in a cafe.

But as Europe tries to wean itself off domestic gas, something made more urgent by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and by soaring energy prices, the country is trying to lead the way in tackling the necessary energy transition. \n\nMatthew Kenyon hears from Michaela Holl of think-tank Agora Energiewende on the Netherlands\u2019 political strategy and from Energiesprong\u2019s Sanne de Wit about their innovative approach to renovation.\n\nThe Hague City Council\u2019s Astrid Kennis talks about what we can all do in our homes to improve insulation and pay for the work that\u2019s necessary. And Ruben Buna Heslinga, of Dutch housing corporation Mitros, talks about a current renovation project in Utrecht. We also hear from Lesley, a tenant in one of the newly refashioned buildings, on what she expects of her energy bills now.\n\nPresenter / producer: Matthew Kenyon\nImage: an apartment block in Utrecht being renovated to meet new environmental standards; Credit: Matthew Kenyon"

According to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR, the war in Ukraine has pushed the number of refugees across the world to more than 100 million. \nIn this programme we hear from refugees about starting a new life - and a new business.\nYuliia is from Ukraine but is now living in England.  On the day she fled her home country, she threw some belongings in a bag, took her two children and drove across Europe.  She was a wedding dress designer in Ukraine and is now hoping to restart her business in the UK.\nRazia works for Silai Wali - a social enterprise led by Afghan-women refugees in New Delhi. It up-cycles waste fabric to create handcrafted decorations.  Plus, Bish Wadeep Mortia who set up the company, tells us more about how it works.  \nAnd Waseem is from Jumpstart Refugee Talent in Canada - it is a refugee-led non-profit organisation whose sole purpose is to help people find work or start new businesses.\nPresented and produced by Jess Quayle\n(Photograph courtesy of Yuliia)"

Mariko also meets the founder of a mobile supermarket business and speaks to the country's former digital minister, Karen Makishima, who says there will be fewer rules for digital start up companies and that the government will be encouraging more diverse entrepreneurs to set up businesses in rural as well as urban areas. \n\nPresenter: Mariko Oi \nProducer: Jagdip Cheema\nImage: Mariko Oi in Tokushima; Credit: BBC"

                "summary": "The mountainous archipelago of S\u00e3oTom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe was once the world\u2019s biggest exporter of cocoa. The twin island nation in the Gulf of Guinea was uninhabited until their discovery by Portuguese explorers in the fifteenth century. They brought slaves to work the land producing cash crops like sugar and coffee. In the 1890s these crops were replaced by cocoa and the islands became known as the biggest cocoa exporter in the world.\n \nThe plantations were farmed first by slaves and then by forced, exploited islanders. When the horrific working conditions were exposed in the 1920s, chocolate manufacturers switched their source of beans to Ghana and Ivory Coast. S\u00e3oTom\u00e9\u2019s ignominious reputation as the chocolate nation was over.\n \nPresenter Tamasin Ford went to visit the islands to take a look at the cocoa sector now.\n\nProduced by Russell Newlove\n\nImage: Chocolate making; Credit: Russell Newlove/BBC"

So what can the past teach us about the current crisis? Vivienne Nunis speaks to the author and journalist Oliver Bullough who's been following the gas trail from the USSR to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Also in the programme, Ajit Niranjan reports from the German coastal resort of Lubmin, where the Nord Stream pipelines transporting Russian gas to Europe come to an end. What do people there make of a future without Russian gas? Producer: Carmel O'Grady. Image: Part of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Credit: Getty Images"
