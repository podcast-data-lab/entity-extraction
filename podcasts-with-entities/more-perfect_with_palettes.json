But at a time when partisanship seeps into every pore of American life, are the nine justices living up to that promise? More Perfect is a guide to the current moment on the Court. We bring the highest court of the land down to earth, telling the human dramas at the Court that shape so many aspects of American life \u2014 from our religious freedom to our artistic expression, from our reproductive choices to our voice in democracy.",

            "content": "<p>This week,\u00a0More Perfect<em>\u00a0</em>takes a look at three amendments on the\u00a0more obscure\u00a0end of\u00a0the spectrum. The 12th, 17th, and 20th Amendments made\u00a0fine-tune adjustments\u00a0to the way we pick our leaders. More Perfect<em>\u00a0</em>is here to prove these\u00a0three are more interesting than you think they are.</p>\n<p>For starters, the 12th Amendment is the secret star of the hit musical \"Hamilton<em>.\"\u00a0</em>The Election of 1800 and the kerfuffle between Aaron Burr and Thomas Jefferson was one of the reasons we passed the 12th\u00a0Amendment, which made it so that\u00a0presidential and vice presidential candidates run alongside each other on a single ticket. It was meant to avoid awkward situations where political opponents suddenly had to be partners in government. But\u00a0Radiolab's<em>\u00a0</em>Rachael Cusick reflects on the Clinton-Trump race and the ways the 12th Amendment may have polarized politics.\u00a0Then, listen to Octopus Project's <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/#amendment-12\">original song</a>\u00a0about the 12th Amendment.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea for the 20th Amendment, which shortened the \"lame duck\" period for outgoing presidents and members of Congress,\u00a0was\u00a0first proposed around the same time as the 12th, but it took years to get political momentum to pass it. That momentum came in part from infamous president, Warren G.

However, they tackle some pretty basic questions: who gets to rule, and who gets to vote? If a president dies or is incapacitated, who takes over? And how old do you have to be in order to participate in American democracy?</p>\n<p>In recent months, the 25th Amendment has swirled in and out of news cycles as Americans debate what it takes to declare a president unfit for office. But this episode looks back, even before the 25th Amendment was ratified, at a moment in 1919 when President Woodrow Wilson became bedridden by stroke, and his wife, Edith Wilson, became our country\u2019s unofficial first female president.</p>\n<p>The 26th Amendment is best encapsulated in a Vietnam-era slogan: \u201cOld enough to fight, old enough to vote.\u201d Eighteen-year-olds at the time argued that if they were old enough to be drafted to fight in the war, they were old enough to have a voice in our democracy. But what about today, when even younger Americans are becoming victims of gun violence and finding themselves at the center of national political debates? Does it mean we should lower the voting age even further?</p>\n<p>When you're done with the episode, check out songs by\u00a0Devendra Banhart and Suburban Living inspired by Amendments 25 and 26 on \"<a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\">27: The Most Perfect Album</a>.\"</p>\n<p><em>In Season Three, More Perfect is taking our camera lens off the Supreme Court and zooming in on the words of the people: the 27 amendments that We The People have made to our Constitution.

In a list of Constitutional\u00a0hits like the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and birthright citizenship, the amendments\u00a0covering\u00a0taxes and term limits\u00a0tend to fall by the wayside. But in\u00a0this episode of More Perfect we\u00a0take these\u00a0forgotten gems\u00a0and make them shine.\nThe 16th Amendment sets up the income tax, sinking dread into the hearts of millions of Americans every April. But if the income tax is so hated, why did we vote to put it in the Constitution? And why do so many people willingly pay? In this episode we take on those questions and\u00a0contemplate whether\u00a0the 16th Amendment might be less about money or law, than is about deciding\u00a0what it means to belong.\nNext we move on to the 22nd Amendment and presidential term limits. If we as U.S. citizens are happy with our leadership, why shouldn't we be able to keep electing the same president for as many terms as we want? The ghost of George Washington comes back to give Franklin Delano Roosevelt some major side-eye as we explore the roots of the rule, and why it matters today.\nWhen you're done with the episode, check out songs by Post Animal and Pavo Pavo inspired by Amendments 16 and 22 on \"27: The Most Perfect Album.\"\nIn Season Three, More Perfect is taking our camera lens off the Supreme Court and zooming in on the words of the people: the 27 amendments that We The People have made to our Constitution.

                "summary": "Amendments 13, 14, and 15 are collectively known as the Reconstruction Amendments: they were passed as instructions to rebuild the country after the Civil War. They addressed slavery, citizenship, equality, and voting rights for Black people. This week, the\u00a0More Perfect\u00a0team explores the\u00a0legacy of the amendments beyond the Civil War \u2014 the ways the\u00a0promises of these amendments changed the country and the ways they've fallen short.\nFirst, More Perfect\u00a0Executive Producer Suzie Lechtenberg and Legal Editor Elie Mystal explore the loophole in the 13th Amendment's slavery ban that's being used in a strange context: college football. We\u00a0share songs about the 13th Amendment from Kash Doll and Bette Smith. Then, producer Julia Longoria shares a conversation with her roommate, Alia Almeida, exploring their relationship to the amendments.\nInspired by the 14th Amendment's grant of equal protection and citizenship rights,\u00a0Sarah Kay's poem tells the story of\u00a0her grandmother, a U.S. citizen who was interned during World War II in a Japanese American Internment camp.\u00a0Despite the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause, the Supreme Court upheld the internment of U.S. citizens based solely on their Japanese heritage in a case called\u00a0Korematsu v. United States. In 2018, the\u00a0Supreme Court said\u00a0Korematsu\u00a0was\u00a0\"wrong the day it was decided.\" The Court went on to uphold President Trump's controversial travel ban in\u00a0Trump v. Hawaii.\u00a0\"Korematsu has nothing to do with this case,\" wrote the majority. In a\u00a0dissenting opinion, Justice Sotomayor\u00a0accused the majority of \"redeploying\u00a0the same dangerous logic underlying\u00a0Korematsu\"\u00a0when they upheld the ban.\nFinally, hear\u00a0songs inspired by the 15th Amendment by Aisha Burns and\u00a0Nnamidi Ogbonnaya.\nIn Season three, More Perfect is taking our camera lens off the Supreme Court and zooming in on the words of the people: the 27 amendments that We The People have made to our Constitution.

                "summary": "Let's get started. If we're talking about the Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, it only feels right to start at the beginning. The First and Second Amendments are arguably the most ferociously contentious amendments of them all, and the Third Amendment is the underdog that everyone underestimates but (maybe) shouldn\u2019t.\nWith that in mind, we dive into the poetic dream behind the First Amendment. This is the amendment that reflects the kind of country the Founding Fathers hoped we would be. Next, we examine the fiercely debated words of the Second Amendment, words that often feel like they divide our nation in two. And finally, we question whether the seemingly irrelevant Third Amendment might actually be the key to figuring out where our country is going.\nAnd when you're done with the episode, take a\u00a0listen to the songs by Joey Stylez, Cherry Glazerr, Sateen, Flor de Toloache, Michael Richard Klics, Palehound, and They Might be Giants inspired by Amendments One, Two and Three on \"27: The Most Perfect Album.\"\nIn Season three, More Perfect is taking our camera lens off the Supreme Court and zooming in on the words of the people: the 27 amendments that We The People have made to our Constitution.

                "summary": "An unassuming string of 16 words tucked into the Constitution grants Congress extensive power to make laws that impact the entire nation. The Commerce Clause has allowed Congress to intervene in all kinds of situations \u2014 from penalizing one man for growing too much wheat on his farm, to enforcing the end of racial segregation nationwide.

But it also challenges us to consider: when we make everything about money, what does it cost us?"

We bring the highest court of the land down to earth, telling the human dramas at the Court that shape so many aspects of American life \u2014 from our religious freedom to our artistic expression, from our reproductive choices to our voice in democracy."
