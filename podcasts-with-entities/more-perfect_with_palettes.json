But at a time when partisanship seeps into every pore of American life, are the nine justices living up to that promise? More Perfect is a guide to the current moment on the Court. We bring the highest court of the land down to earth, telling the human dramas at the Court that shape so many aspects of American life \u2014 from our religious freedom to our artistic expression, from our reproductive choices to our voice in democracy.",

The 12th, 17th, and 20th Amendments made\u00a0fine-tune adjustments\u00a0to the way we pick our leaders. <em>More Perfect\u00a0</em>is here to prove these\u00a0three are more interesting than you think they are.</p>\n<p>For starters, the 12th Amendment is the secret star of the hit musical\u00a0<em>Hamilton.\u00a0</em>The Election of 1800 and the kerfuffle between Aaron Burr and Thomas Jefferson was one of the reasons we passed the 12th\u00a0Amendment, which made it so that\u00a0presidential and vice presidential candidates run alongside each other on a single ticket. It was meant to avoid awkward situations where political opponents suddenly had to be partners in government.

Think of these episodes as the audio liner notes.\nThe 25th and 26th Amendments-- ratified in 1967 and 1971, respectively-- are some of the newest additions to our founding document. However, they tackle some pretty basic questions: who gets to rule, and who gets to vote? If a president dies or is incapacitated, who takes over? And how old do you have to be in order to participate in American democracy?\nIn recent months, the 25th Amendment has swirled in and out of news cycles as Americans debate what it takes to declare a president unfit for office. But this episode looks back, even before the 25th Amendment was ratified: a moment in 1919 when President Woodrow Wilson became bedridden by stroke, and his wife, Edith Wilson, became our country\u2019s unofficial first female president.\nThe 26th Amendment is best encapsulated in a Vietnam-era slogan: \u201cOld enough to fight, old enough to vote.\u201d Eighteen-year-olds at the time argued that if they were old enough to be drafted to fight in the War, they were old enough to have a voice in our democracy.

We're taking on these 27 amendments both in song and in story.\u00a0This episode is best listened to alongside\u00a0<a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\" target=\"_blank\">27: The Most Perfect Album</a></em><em>,\u00a0an entire album (an ALBUM!) and digital experience\u00a0of original music and art inspired by the 27 Amendments. Think of these episodes as the\u00a0audio liner notes.</em></p>\n<p>On first read the\u00a016th and 22nd Amendments are at best sleepers and at worst, stinkers. In a list of Constitutional\u00a0hits like the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and birthright citizenship, the amendments\u00a0covering\u00a0taxes and term limits\u00a0tend to fall by the wayside. But in\u00a0Episode 6 of More Perfect's third season we\u00a0take these\u00a0forgotten gems\u00a0and make them shine.</p>\n<p>The 16th Amendment sets up the income tax, sinking dread into the hearts of millions of Americans every April. But if the income tax is so hated, why did we vote to put it in the Constitution? And why do so many people willingly pay? In this episode we take on those questions and\u00a0contemplate whether\u00a0the 16th amendment might be less about money or law, than is about deciding\u00a0what it means to belong.</p>\n<p>Next we move on to the 22nd Amendment and presidential term limits. If we as U.S. citizens are happy with our leadership, why shouldn't we be able to keep electing the same president for as many terms as we want? The ghost of George Washington comes back to give Franklin Delano Roosevelt some major side-eye as we explore the roots of the rule, and why it matters today.</p>\n<p>When you're done with the episode, check out songs by Post Animal and Pavo Pavo inspired by Amendments 16 and 22 on <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\">27: The Most Perfect Album</a>.</p>"

A then-lawyer at the ACLU named Ruth Bader Ginsburg set out to convince an all-male Supreme Court to take sex discrimination seriously with an unconventional strategy. She didn\u2019t just bring cases where women were the victims of discrimination; she also brought cases where men were the victims.

Sandford</em>\u00a0is one of the most infamous cases in Supreme Court history: in 1857, a slave named Dred Scott filed a suit for his freedom and lost. In his decision, Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney wrote that black men \u201chad no rights which the white man was bound to respect.\u201d \u00a0One civil war and more than a century later, the Taneys and the Scotts reunite at a Hilton in Missouri to figure out what reconciliation looks like in the 21st century.</p>"

                "summary": "<p>On this episode, we visit Edward Blum, a 64-year-old \u201clegal entrepreneur\u201d and former stockbroker who has become something of a Supreme Court matchmaker. He\u2019s had remarkable success, with 6 cases heard before the Supreme Court, including that of Abigail Fisher. We also head to Houston, Texas, where in 1998, an unusual 911 call led to one of the most important LGBTQ rights decisions in the Supreme Court\u2019s history.</p>"
