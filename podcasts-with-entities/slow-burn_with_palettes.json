    "description": "Clarence Thomas is one of the most powerful figures in America today. Nearly every issue of national consequence has his fingerprints all over it, from voting rights to gun rights and from abortion access to affirmative action. But nothing about his journey from rural Georgia to the Supreme Court was inevitable.In the eighth season of Slate\u2019s Slow Burn, host Joel Anderson traces Justice Thomas\u2019 surprising path from youthful radical to conservative icon. You\u2019ll hear about why he came to despise the race-based admission policies that personally benefitted him, how he credited his political rise to the Black self-sufficiency preached by Malcolm X, and what the American people didn\u2019t hear during his explosive confirmation hearings.",

We tell the forgotten story of the first woman ever convicted of manslaughter for getting an abortion. We introduce you to the unlikely Catholic power couple who helped ignite the pro-life movement. And we look at how a rookie Supreme Court justice appointed by Nixon, tackled one of the most pivotal cases in American history.\nTo celebrate this award, we made a special behind-the-scenes episode on how we created the show, as well as five all new Extra episodes\u2014with new interviews, perspectives, and ideas about what might happen next in the fight over legal abortion.\nTo hear those Show of the Year Extras visit:\u00a0https://apple.co/showoftheyear2022\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Nearly every issue of national consequence has his fingerprints all over it, from voting rights to gun rights and from abortion access to affirmative action. But nothing about his journey from rural Georgia to the Supreme Court was inevitable.In the eighth season of Slate\u2019s Slow Burn, host Joel Anderson traces Justice Thomas\u2019 surprising path from youthful radical to conservative icon. You\u2019ll hear about why he came to despise the race-based admission policies that personally benefitted him, how he credited his political rise to the Black self-sufficiency preached by Malcolm X, and what the American people didn\u2019t hear during his explosive confirmation hearings."
