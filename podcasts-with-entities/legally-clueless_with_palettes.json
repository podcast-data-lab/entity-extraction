The podcast is a space where people get to know just how okay it is to not know or not have it all figured out. It is also a space where Africans share stories from their lives; stories that teach, make us cry, make us laugh - real, authentic African stories.\n\nThe #LegallyClueless hotline is +254768628790",

All these and more can be triggering!\n\nBy the way - here's the song of the week that I love! Can't believe I didn't share it with you before! Something's Got To Give by Labrinth:\n\nThe music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTyoJdhs9K0\nThe remix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOQWbljSHw8\nThe live performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYakrT162E\n\nOn #100AfricanStories - Sharon who's a #LegallyClueless listener sent in her audio demo to the hotline number, I sent her some story prompts and then we recorded the story remotely! And man the resilience she has - Mothers are truly super human! I hope you enjoy her story.\n\nThe #LegallyClueless Hotline is: +254 768 628 790\nJoin the tribe on Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/legallycluelesspodcast/",

This was one of my favourite stories to record because of the clarity he has on his grief. I found myself learning a lot about my own grief from him! Not to mention he has got me very interested in getting an ancestral reading from a sangoma too! \n\nNext here are the songs we're diggin this week. I recommend you check out Glory by Nyashinski: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxjX9nbl84U\nAnd blogger behind \"thatnicte.wordpress.com\" sent this song to the #LegallyClueless hotline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ism8dBjxKvc\n\nI know during this pandemic it's easy to feel helpless so I'll keep sharing various ways that you can help especially vulnerable communities. My friend Billian in this episode shares what his organization and others are doing to help families in Mathare.  Here's the paybill information he mentioned:\nPaybill - 891300\nAccount - 39406\nMchanga link: https://changa.page.link/7V1Us\n\nLastly, send through your 1minute demo via whatsapp audio note to the hotline number for a chance to share your story on Legally Clueless! I appreciate all of you whose stories I recorded last week. It's such a honour to receive your stories, honestly!\n\nAnyway, hope you enjoy this episode!"

I'm doing a 7day breathing exercise challenge every morning and it's really helping - especially since this week will be difficult.\n\nI also know you're probably feeling helpless so maybe help the people you interact with daily - employees, staff where you live/work...it may seem small but collectively small can have large impact! Also call your friends and family - a simple phone-call can help calm them.\n\nTuesday marks 8 years since my mum died and I just know this week is going to be pretty rubbish emotionally. In this episode you & I get to hear mum's laugh that I haven't heard in 8 years and 2 days.

We\u2019re talking CAREER \u2013 PURPOSE \u2013 GRIEF \u2013 HEARTBREAK \u2013 MARRIAGE! I\u2019m so nervous \u2013 but I hope I see you there! #WeLoveWomen #WLW\n\nIn this episode I talk about how unable I am to process anger \u2013 it\u2019s such a strange emotion. But I also think it\u2019s probably linked to growing up with a dad who communicated his anger violently (to my mum). I talk about this in this episode. Also on #100AfricanStories Mandi shares her story on overcoming fear, moving back home to Kenya, now being Kenyan enough and how that made her stumble on her passion for food! You can check out all she does here: https://www.mandisarro.co.ke/\n\nPS: I\u2019m still counting down to March 18th when #LegallyClueless turns ONE YEAR OLD! I can\u2019t believe this podcast has grown this far! So to celebrate I\u2019m throwing a storytelling party at Lava Latte on the 18th of March, 7pm, entry is free! Some of your favourite stories, heard on #LegallyClueless will be shared LIVE! Also, YOU get a chance to share YOUR story too! I genuinely hope you can make it!\nHere\u2019s a pin to lava latte: https://goo.gl/maps/WDmCwD5GesMJZewb7"
