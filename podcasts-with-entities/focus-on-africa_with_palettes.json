Last year Haiti's government appealed for help because of spiralling gang violence.   Kenya's Foreign Minister Alfred Mutua says it will be an intervention force to disarm what he called the \"thugs and the gangs\".  So does Kenya really have the capabilities to help end Haiti's violence and how do Kenyan's feel about this deployment? \n\nAlso, why Zambia's former President Edgar Lungu has been warned against jogging in public.  The police have described his weekly workouts as \"political activism\".

Yet these old blocks, abandoned by their owners or the city authorities, are full of families often paying rent to criminal gangs who run them. The buildings, which lack running water, toilets or a legal electricity connection, are then said to have been \"hijacked\". We find out what this means.\n \nA private plane found with more than $5m in cash, fake gold, guns and ammunition on board, is at the centre of a deepening investigation in the Zambian capital, Lusaka.\n \nThe African Climate Summit will take place in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi next week, featuring speakers from Kenya\u2019s government, the African Union and the United Nations. Will the event be just hot air or will it provide a solid plan of action?"
