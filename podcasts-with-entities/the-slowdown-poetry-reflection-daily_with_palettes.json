    "description": "\n      Poet Major Jackson is your guide on the pathways to feel and understand our common journey \u2013 through poetry. In sharing poems, we take a moment to pause and acknowledge the world\u2019s magnitude, and how poets illuminate that mystery. Join The Slowdown for a poem and a moment of reflection in one short episode, every weekday. Produced by APM Studios in partnership with The Poetry Foundation and supported in part by the National Endowment for the Arts.\r<br/>\r<br/>The Slowdown is your daily poetry ritual. Make us a part of your routine as you drink coffee in the morning, as you take a walk in nature, or as you wind down to go to sleep in the evening. With host Major Jackson, we collectively take a moment to calm, to inspire, to learn, and to engage with the best emerging poets and established writers of our time and generations past, from Emily Dickinson to Danez Smith, from Amanda Gorman to Mary Oliver.\r<br/>\r<br/>Listen to our back catalog for episodes by our previous hosts, Tracy K. Smith and Ada Lim\u00f3n,  as well as guest hosts Jenny Xie, Brenda Shaughnessy, Tina Chang, Nate Marshall, Shira Erlichiman, and Jason Schneiderman. Our hosts and production team select poems that move them, and we hope they move you, too.\n    ",

In this episode, Major writes\u2026 \u201cToday\u2019s poem guides us to the revelation that we become the machines we dream, especially when what drives us is to be seen. We find ourselves contending with the mechanization of human behavior that divorces us from our power, which is the very real bodies we live in, and not the projected images of ourselves on screens.\u201d \n\nCelebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

Instead of starting with a highly technical and specific word, like \u201cirony\u201d or \u201ccardiovascular,\u201d Phillis Levin starts with the seemingly simple word \u201cPart,\u201d a common word that, it turns out, can mean many things.\u201d \n\nCelebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.
