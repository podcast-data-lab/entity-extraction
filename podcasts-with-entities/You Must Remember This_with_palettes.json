    "description": "You Must Remember This is a storytelling podcast exploring the secret and/or forgotten histories of Hollywood\u2019s first century. It\u2019s the brainchild and passion project of Karina Longworth (founder of Cinematical.com, former film critic for LA Weekly), who writes, narrates, records and edits each episode. It is a heavily-researched work of creative nonfiction: navigating through conflicting reports, mythology, and institutionalized spin, Karina tries to sort out what really happened behind the films, stars and scandals of the 20th century.",

And yet, if you know Platt\u2019s name today, it\u2019s probably because in 1970 her husband and creative collaborator Peter Bogdanovich had an affair with Cybill Shepherd while shooting the film that launched their careers, The Last Picture Show. But Platt was much more than a jilted wife: she was the secret, often invisible-to-the-public weapon behind some of the best films of the 1970s, '80s and '90s. Drawing on Platt\u2019s unpublished memoir, as well as ample interviews and archival research, The Invisible Woman will tell Polly Platt\u2019s incredible story from her perspective, for the first time.

Williams went on to have a successful singing career and star in movies, but her career trajectory tells more than the story of a black beauty icon who overcame obstacles to make it in Hollywood. It's a story that echoes the legacies of racism, colorism, tokenism and misogynoir (the misogyny experienced specifically by black women) in 20th century Hollywood and how, as a result, black women \u2014 from Williams to Whitney Houston \u2014 have had to display exceptional talent to make the case that their images are worth circulating and celebrating as beautiful.

Elliot possessed one of the most influential voices of the 1960s. However, while her big break with The Mamas and The Papas and meteoric career changed the LA music scene forever, it also entrapped Elliot in a cycle of fat-shaming, sending her spiraling into catastrophic weight-loss regimens. In this episode, we\u2019ll talk about the music industry\u2019s complicated relationship with weight, how crash dieting likely led to the untimely death of this music legend, and the true legacy of Elliot in pop culture.

Williams\u2019s stardom \u2014 and the necessity to maintain her image as a grinning glamour girl, even while submerged underwater \u2014 led to the creation of several waterproof products and swimwear innovations, from waterproof foundation and eyeliner to bathing cap couture. Despite two decades of sustained celebrity and brand power, Williams eventually struggled to maintain the pristine bathing beauty facade. She lost her MGM contract in the 1960s and had to pay millions to the studio in damages. On her way down, she slapped her name on swimming pools and exercise videos, stumbled through four unhappy marriages and started to experiment with LSD for her depression. Drawing on previously untapped resources, Rachel Syme will tell the story of Williams' rise and fall, and the innovations in aqua-beauty she inspired, while also analyzing why we want to be waterproof, why we want to be so invulnerable to the elements and why putting swimming on-screen led to pressures for women to look put-together, even when sopping wet.\u00a0This episode was written and performed by Rachel Syme, a writer, reporter and cultural critic living in New York City.

The public loved nothing better than to see their Marie play a drunk or a dowager and steal every scene from the glamour girls less than half her age. Dressler had been down and out for most of the 1920s. That she became a star at age 60 was an achievement that told Depression-battered audiences it was never too late.

Karloff\u2019s and Corman\u2019s finest collaboration, Peter Bogdanovich\u2019s directorial debut Targets, would serve as a bridge between cinematica eras, paying tribute to Karloff and his long career while depicting events that were shockingly of-the-moment--and still relevant today.

This episode also tells the story of Paul Jarrico, the first screenwriter to be taken to court by a studio (RKO) over the question of his firing during the blacklist period. In partnership with the also-blacklisted writer Michael Wilson and director Herbert Biberman, Jarrico then made Salt of the Earth, a pro-Union, proto-feminist, Neorealist-influenced independent film which the blacklisting-supporting unions effectively silenced, with the help of the media, politicians, and Hughes.

                "summary": "In 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee subpoenaed dozens of Hollywood workers to come to Washington and testify to the presence of Communists in the film industry. 19 of those who were subpoenaed announced that they wouldn't co-operate with the Committee; of those 19, 10 \"unfriendly\" witnesses were called to the stand and refused to answer \"The $64 Question\": \"Are you now or have you ever been a Communist?\" Those 10 men were subsequently denied employment, imprisoned; afraid of collateral damage to the industry, the studio moguls were thus moved to design the Blacklist. This episode will explore the work and politics of the Hollywood Ten \u2013 and films on which they came together, such as Crossfire \u2013 and delve into the far-reaching consequences of their false assumption that the Constitution would protect them.

Garbo and Gilbert starred together in the romantic melodrama Flesh and the Devil, and began a relationship in real-life, which was eagerly exploited by the still-fledgling Hollywood publicity machine.

A vaudevillian who got his start working with Roscoe \u201cFatty\u201d Arbuckle, by the late 1920s Keaton had established himself as a solo writer, director and star who was known for doing his own spectacular but reckless stunts. Keaton joined MGM with a promise from his friend Joe Schenck that nothing would change, only to find himself in his new situation demoted from artistic boss to employee of a corporation interested in protecting its investment above all. The lack of agency and ability to personally control the quality of his own work within the confines of Mayer\u2019s studio drove Keaton to alcoholism, which further doomed his tenure at MGM. Keaton\u2019s experience is perhaps the first major example of an indie filmmaker \u201cselling out\u201d to a big studio, only to be swallowed up by the system.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

That wasn\u2019t the case for another actress mentioned in the ad, Kay Francis, who in 1938 was still Warner Brothers\u2019 highest paid star \u2014 even though she had tried to sue the studio the previous year for casting her in too many bad movies. After roaring her way through New York in the 1920s as a flapper it girl, Kay Francis hit her career peak in 1932, the year she starred in Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s Trouble in Paradise, but eventually she essentially lost her spot in the movie star firmament to Bette Davis. Today we\u2019ll talk about the idea of box office poison, trace how and why Kay Francis became the embodiment of the meeting of 1930s movie star glamour and a devil-may-care pursuit of pleasure that marked pre-Code Hollywood, and explain why that magical combination wasn\u2019t long for the world of the studio star system.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

It wasn\u2019t. This episode was inspired by Hollywood 1938: Motion Pictures' Greatest Year by Catherine Jurca.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices"

Farmer\u2019s beauty and unique screen presence made her a star, but her no-bullshit ballsiness made her a pariah \u2014 and a target of the hostile media \u2014 in 1930s Hollywood. Farmer\u2019s career went down the tubes in the 1940s when a couple of incidents of inconvenient drunkenness led to her being committed to an insane asylum by her own mother, and given a lobotomy. Or, so Cobain and his wife, Courtney Love, frequently told journalists while Cobain was promoting In Utero, the Nirvana album that includes Cobain\u2019s tribute to the actress, \u201cFrances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle\u201d (Love also claimed to have been married to Cobain whilst wearing a dress once owned by Farmer, and the couple named their daughter Frances, although that was likely at least co-inspired by Frances McKee of The Vaselines). Unbeknownst to them, the notion that Farmer was lobotomized was a fiction invented by a biographer with ties to Scientology, a lie which was then dramatized in an Oscar-nominated, Mel Brooks-produced movie which helped to make Jessica Lange a star. By the time Kurt and Courtney were championing Farmer as a proto-punk martyr in the 1990s, the legend of Frances Farmer as patron saint of\u2026well, women like Courtney Love, had been printed so many times that it had swallowed up the truth of Farmer\u2019s experience, and loomed much larger than her actual body of movie work. Today we\u2019ll explore how, and why, that legend got printed, and try to explain how Frances Farmer became the patron saint of beautiful, bright, potentially batshit women whose self-destruction can be traced back to their signing of a studio contract. We have special guest stars! Nora Zehetner (Brick, Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Mad Men and most recently IFC\u2019s Maron) played Frances Farmer; Brian Clark played Kurt Cobain, and Noah Segan IS Rex Reed.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
