The kind that define who you are.\n\nSoto is openly gay now, but he didn\u2019t come out of the closet until a few years ago. He's also been living without citizenship papers in the United States since his family brought him here when he was 6. He kept his undocumented status quiet until recently, too.\n\nIn this episode from our archive, we talk to Soto about being gay and undocumented, and the photographic series he made about the experience. This episode first aired on March 20, 2019."

                "summary": "In a new episode of KPBS' border podcast \"Only Here,\" we continue our series on border art with a mural that's broadcasting the voices of deportees and those commonly known as DREAMers, children brought to the U.S. illegally as children. \n\nFrom heart-wrenching stories about parents being deported and separated from their kids to first-hand accounts of what it\u2019s like to start a new life in a new country, the mural painted on the actual border fence uses technology to share stories of deportation and struggle. \n\nYou can hear the stories when you walk up to the mural in Playas de Tijuana. It's painted on the actual border fence, and you can use your phone to scan black-and-white QR codes printed on little stickers stuck to the mural. Scanning the stickers takes you to YouTube videos. \n\nThe stories you'll hear in the videos are from two digital storytelling archives: \n\nHumanizing Deportation: http://humanizandoladeportacion.ucdavis.edu/en/\nDacamented: https://dacamentedarchive.com/\n\nThe Playas de Tijuana Mural Project is by artist, scholar and activist Lizbeth De La Cruz Santana. More about the project here: https://lizbethdelacruzsantana.com/mural-project\n\n\nAbout the Show:\n\u201cOnly Here\u201d is about the unexplored subcultures, creativity and struggles at the U.S.-Mexico border. The KPBS podcast tells personal stories from people whose lives are shaped by the tension reverberating around the wall. This is a show for border babies, urban explorers or those who wonder what happens when two cultures are both separated and intertwined.\n\nWho we are:\nHosted by Alan Lilienthal\nProduced by Kinsee Morlan\nSound design by Emily Jankowski \n\nFollow Us:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/onlyherepodcast/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/onlyherepodcast/\n\nSupport Us:\nhttps://www.kpbs.org/donate\n\nGive us Feedback:\n619-452-0228\u202c\npodcasts@kpbs.org\n\nPhoto:\nA picture of the mural by Alan Lilienthal."

The transition can be challenging and emotional. \n\nAnd especially for the kids who cross, legally or not, those emotions can be intense. \n\nIn this episode, we dissect a new classical music composition commissioned by the San Diego Symphony that explores what immigration feels like for kids. \n\nWe also drop by the place where the border fence runs into the Pacific Ocean. The symphony has organized performances on both sides of the border here. It's a place with long history of serving as a backdrop for music and art focused on the border and immigration. \n\nOnly here is the symphony bringing together a composer and a poet to make music about kids crossing borders."
