                "summary": "Phil Beaumont, lead vocalist of the San Diego band, The Color Forty Nine, has been belting out tunes since he was a kid living in England back in the \u201970s. After he landed in Southern California for high school and college, he eventually made his way south to Tijuana to see show after show at the legendary music venue Iguana\u2019s. Over time, Phil found himself crossing the border a lot, spending hours writing poetry and lyrics at his favorite bar, Dandy Del Sur. \n \nIn our recurring \u201cMoved by Music\u201d series, we tap into the \u201970s rock records Phil and his brothers listened to as kids, and the punk, two-tone and dub reggae he caught on the John Peel show on BBC radio. Then we dive deep into Phil\u2019s relationship with Tijuana over the years, and how his love of living in a border city led to The Color Forty Nine\u2019s new collaboration with world-famous musician Rub\u00e9n Albarr\u00e1n of Caf\u00e9 Tacvba and Tijuana artist Hugo Crosthwaite. \n \n \nJuly 30 - CDMX - Rey Vinilo (Showcase)\nJuly 31 - Queretaro - Jardin de Cervezas Hercules \nAugust 1 - San Miguel de Allende (TBC)\nAugust 3 - Guanajuato - Nandas\nAugust 5 Puebla - Foro Cultural Karuzo (TBC)\nAugust 7 - CDMX - Bajo Circuito\n \nthecolorfortynine.com\n \nIG: @thecolorfortynine\n \n\nFollow \u201cPort of Entry\u201d online at www.portofentrypod.org, or on Facebook (www.facebook.com/portofentrypodcast) or Instagram (www.instagram.com/portofentrypod).\nSupport our work at www.kpbs.org/donate.

But making music and touring the world wasn\u2019t always the plan for Ramon. He studied and practiced dentistry, and he thought he'd be filling cavities his whole life. Instead, he became one of the most influential pioneers of electronic music in Mexico. In our recurring \u201cMoved by Music\u201d series, we explore some of the futuristic synths and drum machines that set young Ramon\u2019s imagination on fire back in the 70s, the synth pop he we was digging for at record stores in the 80s, and the artists that inspired him in the 90s when he was playing raves all across Mexico.\n\nListen to Ramon\u2019s projects on his family\u2019s record label: www.milovat.org\n\nFollow \u201cPort of Entry\u201d online at www.portofentrypod.org, or on Facebook (www.facebook.com/portofentrypodcast) or Instagram (www.instagram.com/portofentrypod).\nSupport our work at www.kpbs.org/donate.

                "summary": "Today we're tracing the story of how Latin music became as popular as American pop music, all through the eyes of Isabela Raygoza. Isabela is a music journalist from Tijuana and San Diego whose career very closely paralleled the boom in Latin music that's happened over the past decade.\n\nBack in the day, when Latin stars wanted to cross over into pop music, they would have to start singing in English. Nowadays, you have music icons crossing over the other way: singing in Spanish. \n\nAbout the Show:\n\u201cOnly Here\u201d is about the unexplored subcultures, creativity and struggles at the U.S.-Mexico border. The KPBS podcast tells personal stories from people whose lives are shaped by the tension reverberating around the wall. This is a show for border babies, urban explorers or those who wonder what happens when two cultures are both separated and intertwined.\n\nFollow Us:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/onlyherepodcast/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/onlyherepodcast/\n\nSupport Us:\nhttps://www.kpbs.org/donate\n\nGive us Feedback:\n619-452-0228\u202c\npodcasts@kpbs.org"

You'll know it's happening when you see the word \"conversation\" in the title of the episode. \n\nTo be honest, the highly produced episodes you\u2019re used to hearing take a lot of time. Between field recordings, research, sound design and writing, it\u2019s just a ton of work. We had to come up with a way to give our small team more time between new episodes so we can get even better at telling these longer, more nuanced stories. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing these conversations -- to give ourselves the time we need to make the best show possible. \n\nSo, in this new conversation series, we\u2019re going to talk to creatives, entrepreneurs, influencers- anyone that embodies our binational region and can help us get to know it a little better. \n\nWe\u2019re going to start this week with the greatest food in the world \u2014 tacos. We all love tacos and Tijuana has arguably some of the best in all of Mexico. Scott Koenig is always on the hunt for the best tacos in TJ. He's the writer behind the travel website \u201cA Gringo In Mexico.\" Koenig has also written a book called \u201cSeven Days in The Valle: Baja California\u2019s Wine Country Cuisine\u201d and he writes columns about food in Baja for several local publications. \n\nWe talk to Scott about living in the moment, immigration's wonderful effect on food and his outsider's take on tacos in Tijuana. He gives us a quick list of a few good taco shops in Tijuana and the tacos to try at each one. \n\nTacos Birria Martin: Tacos Fitos, Xolotacos\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Tacos-de-birria-Martin-178106339200263/\n\nMariscos Walter: Mariscos Ruben, Mariscos Mazate\u00f1o\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mariscoswalter2005/\n\nTacos Chuy, Tacos El Vaquero, Tacos Don Esteban\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tacos.chuyjuarez/\n\nAbout the Show:\n\u201cOnly Here\u201d is about the unexplored subcultures, creativity and struggles at the U.S.-Mexico border.
