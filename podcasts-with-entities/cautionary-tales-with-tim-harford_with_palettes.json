Some of these true stories are tragic, some are comic, but like the great fables and parables, each of them has a moral. Equipped with the latest research from psychology, economics and the social sciences, Harford explains why things went so awry \u2013 and teaches us lessons that we won\u2019t forget.\r\n\r\n Learn more about your ad-choices at https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."
