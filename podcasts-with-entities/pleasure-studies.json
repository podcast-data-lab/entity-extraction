    "description": "Indie icon Feist knows a thing or two about love, loss, and everything in between. Through in-depth interviews with a time travel researcher, a Dreamer and activist, a transgender triathlete, an FBI undercover operative, a monogamous couple in adult film, a professional storm-chaser, an alter ego, and more, <em>Pleasure Studies </em>explores big themes from the tracks of her most recent album: self-reinvention and creativity, the power of the natural world, youth, old age, wisdom, and the passing of time. We hear the stories of people who have followed their dreams, lived long lives, endured devastation, and come out the other side with a greater understanding of what it means to be alive. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> See <a style='color:grey;' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'>acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p>",

Through in-depth interviews with a time travel researcher, a Dreamer and activist, a transgender triathlete, an FBI undercover operative, a monogamous couple in adult film, a professional storm-chaser, an alter ego, and more, <em>Pleasure Studies </em>explores big themes from the tracks of her most recent album: self-reinvention and creativity, the power of the natural world, youth, old age, wisdom, and the passing of time. We hear the stories of people who have followed their dreams, lived long lives, endured devastation, and come out the other side with a greater understanding of what it means to be alive. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> See <a style='color:grey;' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'>acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p>"
