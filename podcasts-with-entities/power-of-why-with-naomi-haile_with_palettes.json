Previously, Sergio served in several HR leadership roles at PepsiCo, and spent 20 years exploring many learning opportunities.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Sergio delves into some of his HR, life, and work. He also speaks to the culture of freedom and accountability at Netflix. And one of my favourite pieces was Sergio\u2019s musings about keeping your values at the forefront of your decisions. And if you are curious about the Netflix aspect of his story, he also speaks about what it has been like to navigate his new role as Netflix\u2019s Chief HR officer.</p>\n<p><u><strong>This episode is for you if:</strong></u></p>\n<ul>\n <li>You\u2019re a people leader and are interested in learning about an unconventional approach to HR</li>\n <li>Netflix\u2019s culture intrigues you</li>\n  <li>You want to learn what it really means to operate with little rules</li>\n  <li>You\u2019re interested in empowering your leaders and employees to make sound decisions</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Connect with Sergio&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>LinkedIn: </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergioezama\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Sergio Ezama</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Connect with Naomi</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Website: </strong><a href=\"http://www.naomihaile.com/\"><u><strong>naomihaile.com</strong></u></a></li>\n  <li><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/naomiahaile/\"><u><strong>@naomiahaile</strong></u></a></li>\n  <li><strong>Twitter: </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/naomiathaile\"><u><strong>@naomiathaile</strong></u></a></li>\n  <li><strong>LinkedIn: </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomihail/\"><u><strong>Naomi Haile</strong></u></a></li>\n</ul>\n"

Creating lyrics that uplifted people on their own personal path. And as he got older, he decided to play around with music production programs. Alex focused on building skills and created his musical melodies from scratch, in the genres of classical, hip hop, R&amp;B, and Lo-Fi. And as much as he you enjoyed music, he wanted to explore other avenues of creativity that other people could enjoy.</p>\n<p>As you will (or have already) notice, Alex has the PERFECT radio host voice. His peers encouraged him to get into radio and as much as I liked the idea, he didn't just want to be on the radio <em>just</em> because he has a deep voice. Alex wanted to make something productive valuable.</p>\n<p>He had the equipment from his music production days and just went for it. Now, he has an amazing podcast called <a href=\"https://timeforyourhobby.wixsite.com/podcast\"><strong>Time For Your Hobby</strong></a>. He has interviewed over 100 people on his show from across the world, which you can check out <a href=\"https://timeforyourhobby.wixsite.com/podcast/world-map\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Connect with Alex</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Website: <a href=\"https://timeforyourhobby.wixsite.com/podcast\">Time for Your Hobby</a></li>\n  <li>Podcast: <a href=\"https://timeforyourhobby.podbean.com/\">Time for Your Hobby Podcast</a></li>\n  <li>Podcast Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dRcTvIm8Eoqgi9-1X9EMTW8AnCTflCgIBftzIdSX7Gs/edit\">Useful Podcast Resources</a></li>\n  <li>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/timeforyourhobby/\">@timeforyourhobby</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tfyhpodcast?lang=en\">@tfyhpodcast</a></li>\n  <li>Email Alex at timeforyourhobby.gmail.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Connect with Naomi</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Website \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.naomihaile.com/\"><strong>naomihaile.com</strong></a></li>\n  <li>Instagram \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/naomiahaile/\"><strong>@naomiahaile</strong></a></li>\n  <li>Twitter \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naomiathaile\"><strong>@naomiathaile</strong></a></li>\n  <li>LinkedIn \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomihail/\"><strong>Naomi Haile</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomihail/\"><br>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

Her art is a way of self- expression and to call to attention the beauty in diversity.</p>\n<p>In 2019, I first came across Fatuma's art at the Women Who Work Gala held by The Embassy of Gabon and Gwen Madiba in Ottawa. Fatuma was showcasing her art in prime space - right at the entrance for people to admire and enjoy before they Gala started. It was through her art, that I felt that I had already met her.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Fatuma became a published author and even held her first book signing a year later in 2019. She continues to surprise and delight her audience and her work inspires the community to express themselves. Fatuma writes, draws, paints, and on her days off, spends time giving back to the community at the local shelter in Ottawa, Canada.</p>\n<p>Fatuma\u2019s passion is to encourage people to embrace their own uniqueness. Every piece of art holds meaning and is a vessel to tell many stories. She is capturing the human experience through her unique lens.</p>\n<h2><strong>Connect with Fatuma</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n <li>Check out Fatuma's art on her <a href=\"https://www.fatumakou.com/shop\">Website</a></li>\n <li>Connect with Fatuma on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fatuma_kou/\">Instagram</a></li>\n  <li>Order Fatuma's books on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Kindle-Store-Fatuma-Kou/s?rh=n%3A2972705011%2Cp_27%3AFatuma+Kou\">Amazon</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Connect with Naomi</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Check out Naomi's <a href=\"http://www.naomihaile.com/\">Website</a></li>\n  <li>Connect with Naomi on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomihail/\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n  <li>Keep updated with the podcast on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/naomiahaile/\">Instagram</a></li>\n  <li>Connect with Naomi on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naomiathaile\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

Before her journey creating this movement, Mimi was working in the corporate world.</p>\n<p>Mimi started her corporate career working for a few giants in the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry, making her way up in sales. After spending years in this industry, drinking the \u201ccorporate kool-aid\u201d, she felt that she lost track of her true essence.

Whether it's long journeys or daily commutes, she yearned for classic and casual styles with a story. After a trip to Ethiopia, her father, Dagne Tedla, brought several leather goods home as gifts for friends and family, only to realize that he needed to go back to Addis Ababa for more! Thus, the birth of UnoEth began.\n\nUpon embarking on this new adventure and with a background in Merchandising and Marketing, Xiomara only wanted to deliver quality and timeless pieces that could be worn for years on end, surpassing trendy styles and fads. All UnoEth goods are handmade, 100% Ethiopian leather, and crafted by artisans and small businesses in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\u00a0\n\nYou can connect with Xiomara and UnoEth here:\nUnoEth Website: https://unoeth.com/\u00a0\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/unoeth\u00a0\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/unoeth\u00a0\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/unoeth\u00a0\n\nYou can connect with Naomi here:\u00a0\nWebsite: www.naomihaile.com\u00a0\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/naomiahaile/\u00a0\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomihail/\u00a0\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/naomiathaile \u00a0\n"
