Kellie Carter Jackson and Leah Wright Riguer are historians, best friends, and Oprah obsessives. Now, it\u2019s time to pour through the archives to relive and rehash the most iconic episodes from the decades-long run of the Oprah Winfrey Show.</p>\n\n<p>From book club controversies to diet fads and wars with the meat industry, conversations about police brutality and sexuality\u2026 and of course big giveaways\u2026 Oprahdemics will treat Oprah as the historical, social, and political force that she is \u2014 and have have lots of fun. </p>\n\n<p>As Kellie and Leah recap each show, they\u2019ll put the show in critical context, and ultimately explain why Oprah will always be the Queen of Talk.</p>\n    ",
