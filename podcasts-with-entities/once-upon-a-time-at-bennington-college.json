    "description": "It\u2019s the groves of academe: Bennington College, the wildest and wickedest school in America. In the last great decade: the 1980s. Bennington class of \u201986, class of Bret Easton Ellis, future writer of American Psycho and co-leader of the literary Brat Pack; Jonathan Lethem, future writer of Motherless Brooklyn and MacArthur Fellow; and Donna Tartt, future writer of The Secret History and Pulitzer Prize winner. All three are, at various times, infatuated and disappointed with one another, their friendships stimulated and fueled by rivalry as much as affection. And all three will mythologize Bennington in their fiction\u2014fiction that, as we\u2019ll discover, isn\u2019t always fiction, is often fact\u2014and thereby become myths themselves.\u00a0From the Peabody-nominated C13Originals studios and Vanity Fair's Lili Anolik, comes the latest installment in the \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u2026\u201d franchise, Once Upon a Time\u2026 at Bennington College. This is a tale of money, murder, madness, and\u2014of course\u2014genius. This is, too, a multi-dimensional expose: the secret history of The Secret History revealed; the secret history of three of the greatest writers of Generation X revealed; and the secret history of Generation X itself revealed.\u00a0This follows Season One of the franchise,\u00a0Once Upon a Time...in the Valley, a real-life psychological thriller about underage adult star Traci Lords.",

Bennington class of \u201986, class of Bret Easton Ellis, future writer of American Psycho and co-leader of the literary Brat Pack; Jonathan Lethem, future writer of Motherless Brooklyn and MacArthur Fellow; and Donna Tartt, future writer of The Secret History and Pulitzer Prize winner. All three are, at various times, infatuated and disappointed with one another, their friendships stimulated and fueled by rivalry as much as affection. And all three will mythologize Bennington in their fiction\u2014fiction that, as we\u2019ll discover, isn\u2019t always fiction, is often fact\u2014and thereby become myths themselves.\u00a0From the Peabody-nominated C13Originals studios and Vanity Fair's Lili Anolik, comes the latest installment in the \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u2026\u201d franchise, Once Upon a Time\u2026 at Bennington College. This is a tale of money, murder, madness, and\u2014of course\u2014genius. This is, too, a multi-dimensional expose: the secret history of The Secret History revealed; the secret history of three of the greatest writers of Generation X revealed; and the secret history of Generation X itself revealed.\u00a0This follows Season One of the franchise,\u00a0Once Upon a Time...in the Valley, a real-life psychological thriller about underage adult star Traci Lords."
