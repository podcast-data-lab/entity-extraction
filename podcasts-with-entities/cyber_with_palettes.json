But let\u2019s take Musk seriously for an hour or so. He is the richest man in the world. He has big dreams and some of the resources to achieve them. The Pentagon is paying him for rocket launches. Starlink works and has been instrumental in the war in Ukraine.</p><br><p>So who is Elon Musk and why do we care so much? His detractors see only a shitposter who made some great business bets. His fans see him as a messianic figure, a superhero who will lead us into a new golden age of technology.</p><br><p>But what\u2019s the truth? Is it somewhere in between?

            "contentSnippet": "We\u2019ve got a special presentation on the show for you today, an interview with Yuliana Shemetovets, the spokesperson for a group of ethical hackers going to war with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. They\u2019re called the Cyber Partisans and they\u2019re responsible for hacks against the Lukashenko regime.\n\nLukashenko is a die-hard Putin ally who has been in charge of Belarus since 1994. In that time, the country has become more unstable. Protestors have disappeared from the streets and Belarus has allowed Russian troops to move through the country to strike at Ukraine.\n\nThe Cyber Partisans have worked behind the scenes to disrupt Lukashenko\u2019s regime. They\u2019ve hacked the Belarusian railway system, which still runs on Windows XP, and obtained phone calls between government officials.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear a little untranslated Belarussian in this episode. I only want to highlight one bit that I think is important. When Shemetovets is talking about acquiring phone calls, we\u2019ll play the raw audio of Belarussian government officials talking. What you\u2019re hearing is someone bragging about beating up a protestor.\n\n\u201cI open the\u2026car door, and pull this [woman] by her hair. I kicked her, and told the riot police to..and that bitch started screaming.\u201d\n\nThe translated audio has quite a few more explivites in it.\n\nThis is an on-camera interview that first aired on VICE News as an episode of SuperUsers. It was produced by Louise McLoughlin and Cal Bateman.\n\nWe\u2019re recording CYBER live on Twitch. Watch live on Wednesdays at 4pm EST. Follow us there to get alerts when we go live. We take questions from the audience and yours might just end up on the show.\n\nSubscribe to CYBER on Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen to your podcasts.\n\n Hosted on Acast.
