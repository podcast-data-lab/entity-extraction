Tech reporter Will Oremus says that his departure is shrouded in mystery and that the resignation letter he posted to Twitter did not explain whether he was voluntarily leaving the company or was ousted by investors.\u00a0\n\n\nDorsey\u2019s replacement is Parag Agrawal, the company\u2019s former chief technology officer. While he\u2019s well-liked by staff, he was an unexpected pick to head one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most fraught and politically embroiled social media companies \u2014 and it\u2019s up in the air whether his limited experience will limit his ability to navigate important and thorny questions around content moderation.",

And earlier this year, when the pandemic triggered a wave of anti-Asian violence, she found herself wondering what role she should play in conversations around anti-Asian hate. \u201cAm I Asian enough to be upset?\u201d she asked. \u201cAm I White enough to be making a difference?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAmerican teenagers are part of what's likely the most diverse generation in our nation\u2019s history \u2014 new Census Bureau data shows that the population under 18 is a majority minority for the first time. These young people are also helping to shape more of the conversations we\u2019re all having about race. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll found that nearly three-quarters of teens say they\u2019ve talked to a parent about race in the past year. More than half say they\u2019ve had a similar conversation with a close friend. As part of The Washington Post\u2019s Teens in America series, we\u2019re exploring what those conversations sound like.\u00a0\n\n\nMiranda\u2019s story is the first in a new five-part series from The Post and YR Media, a nonprofit media, music and technology incubator. Listen in as teen reporters from around the country have tough conversations about race with family and friends, and with host Martine Powers.",

Kelly verdict this week, the cases of hundreds of other sex-trafficked children came to mind.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPeople were finally praising and recognizing these Black girls who came forward again and again and went through the grueling process of what it takes to testify in a case like this, and thanking them for coming forward and for their bravery,\u201d Contrera says. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to remember the context that Black girls who are sex-trafficking victims are also the most likely to be treated as criminals for being sold for sex.\u201d\n\n\nEvery year, Contrera says, dozens of teenagers are locked up despite being victims of a crime. In Las Vegas, Contrera went on a ride-along with a vice unit as it arrested child sex-trafficking victims, and she reports on what it was like for these youths to be sent to detention centers rather than given help.",

We interviewed colleagues who covered 9/11 to try to make sense of how that day changed the country and the world.\n\n\nRead more:\n\n\n\u201cWhere were you on September 11th?\u201d Most Americans over a certain age have a 9/11 story \u2014 of the moment they heard the news of the terrorist attacks, or of anxiously calling family members to make sure they were okay.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the 20 years since the attacks, that day for some may feel like a slowly fading memory. But the direct consequences of that Tuesday in 2001 are still playing out in the news in front of us every day.\n\n\nToday on Post Reports, we\u2019re telling the story of 9/11 through the eyes of our newsroom. We spoke with Post colleagues who covered it \u2014 from senior editors, to reporters at the Pentagon, to an intern.\n\n\n\u201cIt changed everyone's lives,\u201d says Post reporter Juliet Eilperin, who was covering Congress that day, \u201cnot only in terms of those who lost people that they cared about that day, but what it meant for the commitment of our military and what it meant for people living in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\nAs the Afghanistan war comes to a harrowing close, we look at how the 9/11 terrorist attacks shaped our world and how the consequences of that day are still with us.\u00a0\n\n\nThis story was produced by Ariel Plotnick and Emma Talkoff. It was edited by Maggie Penman, Renita Jablonski and Martine Powers.\n\n\nIt was scored and mixed by Ted Muldoon, who wrote original music for this show.\u00a0\n\n\nReena Flores and Rennie Svirnovskiy were also a huge help with this story.\nIn this story, you\u2019ll hear the voices of Leonard Downie, Arthur Santana, Juliet Eilperin, Valerie Strauss, Amy Goldstein, Amy Argetsinger, Marc Fisher, Katie Shaver, Karen DeYoung, Mike Allen, Rosalind S. Helderman, Chuck Lane, Debbi Wilgoren and Matt Vita.\u00a0\n\n\nThank you to WTOP News for sharing its 9/11 archive.\n\n\nWe talked to so many people for this story who helped shape our understanding of that day, including Tracy Grant, Freddy Kunkle, Dana Milbank, Ellen Nakashima, Ann Gerhart and Dudley Brooks.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd a big thank-you to Joe Heim, who pitched this idea to our show.\nThe Post has many other stories reflecting on the anniversary of 9/11 and how our country has changed 20 years later.\n\n\nListen to \u201cAmerica\u2019s Song,\u201d a special podcast series from The Post about how a singing police officer comforted a grieving nation after 9/11 \u2014 and why the moment couldn\u2019t last.\n\n\n9/11 was a test. Carlos Lozada writes that the books of the past two decades show how America failed.",

These Afghanistan papers are a secret history of the war, Whitlock tells Martine Powers, and \u201cthey contain these frank admissions of how the war was screwed up and that what the American people were being told about the war wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThey really do bring to mind the Pentagon Papers, which were the Defense Department\u2019s top-secret history of the Vietnam War,\u201d Whitlock says.\u00a0\n\n\nThese recordings have new resonance this week.\u00a0\n\n\nRead excerpts from Craig Whitlock\u2019s new book, \u201fThe Afghanistan Papers: A Secret History of the War\u201d.\nDeceptions and lies: What really happened in Afghanistan\n\n\nThe grand illusion: Hiding the truth about the Afghanistan war\u2019s \u2018conclusion\u2019",

This time, some\u00a0Republicans supported the move, like Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). Reporter Mike\u00a0DeBonis\u00a0reports on what it was like to be there today.\n\n\nAnd while we\u2019ve all been transfixed by the attack on the Capitol and its fallout \u2013 there's still a pandemic happening. On Tuesday, more than 4,200 Americans died of covid-19. Jon Gerberg is a video journalist for The Post. He got rare access to a hospital in California\u00a0where\u00a0a covid-19 surge has completely overwhelmed the health-care system. He talked about it with producer Linah Mohammad.\u00a0\n\n\nSubscribe to The Washington Post:\u00a0postreports.com/offer",

After the attack on the Capitol, lawmakers seemed to come together \u2014 but will that last with a 50-50 Senate? And an update from Georgia.\n\n\nRead more:\n\n\nWhite House bureau chief Phil Rucker brings us behind the scenes of a week when President Trump incited a mob of his supporters to attack the Capitol, and then, grudgingly, admitted his loss.\u00a0\n\n\nWith Democratic victories in Georgia\u2019s runoff elections, the Senate will be equally split, with Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote. David Fahrenthold breaks down what that could look like.\u00a0\n\n\nLast month, our host Martine Powers and producer Ted Muldoon reported from Georgia on the runoff elections, and all the people on the ground who were working to deliver a victory to the Democrats \u2014 and the first Black senator from the state. One of those people was Bob Melvin, who we learned after the canvassing trip had contracted the coronavirus. We checked in with him this week after the Democrats\u2019 victory.\n\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this episode mistakenly said that Trump would be the second president to skip his successor\u2019s Inauguration. In fact, there have been at least three others \u2014 John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Johnson.\n\n\nSubscribe to The Washington Post: https://postreports.com/offer",
