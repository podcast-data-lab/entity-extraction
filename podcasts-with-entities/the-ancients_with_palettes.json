With each new discovery offering a fresh insight into what life was like 2000 years ago, we're able to piece together Pompeii's vibrant past and culture thanks to the work of Archaeologists and historians today.

Looking at the recent archaeology, the role of the goddess Fortuna, and the indomitable Julia Felix - what would Pompeii have been like for the people who lived there, and what was life like after for those who survived the eruption?\n\nYou can buy Elodie's book here.\n\nDiscover the past with exclusive history documentaries and ad-free podcasts presented by world-renowned historians from History Hit.

But due to their limited presence in the archaeological record and the complexities of multiple kings, kingdoms, and languages involved, unravelling the true identity of the Picts and understanding why Rome harboured such animosity towards them can be challenging. So what sources can archaeologists turn to, and what does it show us about ancient Scotland?</p><br><p>In this episode, Tristan welcomes Professor Gordon Noble from the University of Aberdeen to shed light on the enigmatic culture of the Picts. By examining Imperial sources, ancient artwork, and even the earliest known form of daily 'tweets', what insights can we gather about the Picts?

This begs the question: how did Ravenna attain such significance, and what insights can we glean from the art and architecture that remain there today, particularly from the 5th and 6th centuries?</p><br><p>In this episode, Tristan invites Professor Judith Herrin on to the podcast, to delve into the rise and fall of Ravenna's prominence. Together, they explore its intricate connections with the Western Roman Empire, its interactions with notable entities like the Goths, and the awe-inspiring Christian architecture that adorned its landscape.

Sometime between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago in Sub-Saharan Africa, massive numbers of Proto-Bantu speaking peoples spread out around the continent from an unknown central location. As they moved into new areas, the Bantu brought with them their language, culture, and technology - displacing or absorbing many non-Bantu speaking groups of hunter-gatherers &amp; pastoralists. Today, Bantu languages are spoken by over 400 million people. So why aren't these events more widely known?</p><br><p>In this episode, Tristan is joined by historian Luke Pepera to help untangle the mysteries of this key event in both African and World History. But with limited archaeological sources, how do we know what really happened - and what role can genetic evidence play in solving this mystery?</p><br><p>The Senior Producer was Elena Guthrie</p><p>The Assistant Producer was Annie Coloe</p><p>Edited by Aidan Lonergan</p><br><p>For more Ancients content, subscribe to our Ancients newsletter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.historyhit.com/sign-up-to-history-hit/?utm_source=timelinenewsletter&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=Timeline+Podcast+Campaign\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>&nbsp;</p><br><p>If you'd like to learn even more, we have hundreds of history documentaries, ad free podcasts and audiobooks at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://access.historyhit.com/?utm_source=audio&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=Podcast+Campaign&amp;utm_id=Podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">History Hit</a>&nbsp;- enter promo code ANCIENTS for a free trial, plus 50% off your first three months' subscription.</p><br><p>To download, go to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.historyhit&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Android &gt;</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/history-hit/id1303668247\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple store &gt;</a></p>"

In this episode, Tristan Hughes is joined by Ancient Greek historian Dr Ellie Mackin Roberts of Kings College London&nbsp;to uncover the truth about Hera, find out where she came from, how she was worshipped and continued to be worshipped in her afterlives, and as a bonus why peacocks were sacred to her.</p><br><p>If you enjoyed this episode, you might also enjoy other episodes in the series: Zeus: King of the Gods. <a href=\"https://pod.fo/e/14ec89\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://pod.fo/e/14ec89</a></p><br><p>The Senior Producer was Elena Guthrie</p><p>The script was written by Andrew Hulse</p><p>The voice over was performed by Nichola Woolley</p><p>The Assistant Producer was Annie Coloe</p><br><p>For more Ancients content, subscribe to our Ancients newsletter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.historyhit.com/sign-up-to-history-hit/?utm_source=timelinenewsletter&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=Timeline+Podcast+Campaign\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>&nbsp;</p><br><p>If you'd like to learn even more, we have hundreds of history documentaries, ad free podcasts and audiobooks at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://access.historyhit.com/?utm_source=audio&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=Podcast+Campaign&amp;utm_id=Podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">History Hit</a>&nbsp;- enter promo code ANCIENTS for a free trial, plus 50% off your first three months' subscription.</p><br><p>To download, go to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.historyhit&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Android &gt;</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/history-hit/id1303668247\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple store &gt;</a></p>"

Otherwise erased from history, the tomb of this 18th Dynasty Pharaoh would go on to change the world. Undoubtedly cited as one of the greatest archaeological finds in human history, do we really know what happened in November 1922? Or is there more to the story?</p><br><p>In the second episode of our Tutankhamun series, Tristan is joined by Egyptologist and author Bob Brier a.k.a. \u201c<em>Mr Mummy</em>\u201d. Together they tell us the details of this groundbreaking discovery, and help illuminate the missing characters. How did Howard Carter stumble across a world changing archaeological find - and was it worth the breakdown in diplomatic relations that followed?</p><br><p>Content Warning: This episode contains references to miscarriages that some listeners may find upsetting.</p><br><p>For more Ancients content, subscribe to our Ancients newsletter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.historyhit.com/sign-up-to-history-hit/?utm_source=timelinenewsletter&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=Timeline+Podcast+Campaign\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.&nbsp;If you'd like to learn even more, we have hundreds of history documentaries, ad free podcasts and audiobooks at&nbsp;History Hit&nbsp;- <a href=\"https://access.historyhit.com/?utm_source=audio&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=Podcast+Campaign&amp;utm_id=Podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe today</a>!</p>"

But what has archaeology revealed about the Late Iron Age British societies they interacted with? Do we have any concrete evidence for the druids? Was human sacrifice a thing?

A small Persian force, entrenched in a formidable defensive position that blockaded Alexander\u2019s route to the Persian heartlands. A narrow pass through the Zagros Mountains that has gone down in history as the Persian, or Susian, Gates. Although nowhere near the size or scale of Alexander\u2019s previous pitched battles against the Persians at the Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela, this clash in the mountains deserves its moment in the spotlight.

A clash that occurred in mid/late December 218 BC, in northern Italy very close to the Po River. This clash was the Battle of the River Trebia, fought between the Roman consular army of Sempronius Longus and the conglomerate Carthaginian force under the leadership of the legendary Hannibal Barca.

Over the past couple of days, the last US and NATO troops have withdrawn from Bagram air base, which they have occupied for some 20 years. But this area of Central Asia, situated south of the Hindu Kush mountain range, also has some remarkable ancient history. In the area around Bagram lie the remains of ancient Begram (Kapisi). The city witnessed several waves of ancient superpowers. The Persians came here, as did Alexander the Great and his successors. But it was during the age of the Kushan Empire (1st \u2013 4th centuries AD) that it appears the rich, ancient city of Begram enjoyed its golden age. </p><br><p>In this fascinating podcast, University of Freiburg\u2019s Lauren Morris brilliantly guides us through Begram\u2019s ancient history and why this site is so extraordinary. Lauren also tells the remarkable story behind the excavations at Begram during the 1930s and how it could be a big hit Netflix show in its own right.Part 2 will be out soon and will be centred on the Begram\u2019s most remarkable archaeological discovery: the Begram Hoard.</p>"

Situated in the southern Peloponnese, this ancient Hellenic city-state has become ingrained in popular imagination as the home of unmatched Greek super soldiers, trained for war since youth and raised within a system unlike any other in the Classical Greek world. But away from common perception, what do we actually know about Spartan society? Especially during the city\u2019s \u2018golden age\u2019 in the 5th and early 4th centuries BC? What evidence do we have for some of the most renowned stories of Spartan lifestyle? How much of it can we believe? To provide a concise overview, Tristan was delighted to be joined by Professor Stephen Hodkinson, one of the leading authorities on ancient Sparta. Part 2 will be released in a couple of weeks."

They have been portrayed as a savage people, who contributed little to world history. But is this really the case? In this podcast, Tristan was joined by Professor Hyun Jin Kim to talk about the emergence of the Huns in the west in the late 4th century, and the striking geopolitical changes that their rapid expansion brought about. Hyun Jin dismantles the portrayal that all the Huns did was destroy and plunder and highlights the remarkable structure of this ancient empire. The first unified empire in Europe beyond Rome\u2019s borders.</p><p>Hyun Jin is a Professor in Classics at the University of Melbourne, Australia. He is the author of The Huns, published by Routledge in 2016.</p>"

Echoes of this battle, reportedly fought between a seven thousand strong Greek army and a Persian force of anywhere between 100 thousand and one million, can be found dotted across the literature and history of Ancient Greece and Rome. Professor Chris Carey from University College London has written a book on Thermopylae and, in this episode, he tells us how its shadow continues to the present day, where the battle and its heroes are referenced by those fighting for freedom, as well as in films and video games."

Covered walkways, street side shops and an ornate fountain are just a few of the structures that we know were present along this central road, now known as the Stanegate. Metres away, however, you have the remains of very different structures surviving. Military buildings, \u2018mini forts\u2019 that were slotted into Corbridge\u2019s bustling town landscape, when the legionaries returned here in the 2nd century.

With that in mind, it is perhaps no surprise that some periods of Ancient Egypt fall beneath the radar. The Late Period of Ancient Egypt, however, is not without drama. These final centuries are characterised by repeated invasions and leadership by foreign rulers. Chris Naunton is an Egyptologist, writer and broadcaster. He spoke to Tristan about the influence of external forces on Ancient Egyptian society from the Third Intermediate Period through the Late Period. This included Libyan, Assyrian, Persian and, notably, an Ancients\u2019 favourite, the Macedonian Alexander the Great."

For a start, where was it? Dr Joanne Ball, from the University of Liverpool is a battlefield archaeologist. In this episode she takes Tristan through this story of the betrayal and destruction of three of Emperor Augustus\u2019 Roman legions - under the leadership of Varus - by a Germanic alliance led by Arminius, a Germanic auxiliary officer brought up as a hostage of the Roman Empire. Together they explore the circumstances which led the Roman leaders to trust a Germanic subject against his fellow Germanic nationals. They also go through the evidence which places the ambush at Kalkriese and the battle\u2019s extensive legacy, some of which stems from conflicting accounts of its location.</p><br><p>Presented by Tristan Hughes (@ancientstristan)</p><p>Featuring Jo Ball (@DrJEBall)</p><p>Edited by Sophie Gee (@SophieGee12)</p>"

Near the town of Philippi in northern Greece the forces of Brutus and Cassius, the famous assassins of Julius Caesar and the last surviving cheerleaders of the Roman Republic, faced off against the armies of Marc Antony and young Octavian. Two separate battles were fought, the results of which decided the future direction of Rome. I was delighted to get the brilliant Steele Brand (@steele_brand) back on the podcast to talk me through these all-important battles. From the background to Brutus\u2019 pitiful demise Steele guided me through the final Roman attempts to restore the Republic and how they were ultimately squashed by a combination of political brilliance, suicidal blunders and outrageous luck.</p><br><p>Steele is the author of \u2018Killing for the Republic: Citizen Soldiers and the Roman Way of War\u2019.</p><br><p>Steele's Twitter: @steele_brand</p><p>Tristan's Twitter: @ancientstristan</p><br><p>Steele's previous appearance on The Ancients: https://play.acast.com/s/the-ancients/killingfortheromanrepublic</p><br><p>Quick note:</p><br><p>Lycia was a region in southwest Anatolia that bordered the Mediterranean Sea.</p>"

Mind-boggling and incredible. Later they would voyage even further into the Pacific, settling the likes of Easter Island, Vanuatu and New Zealand. So how did they do this? How were they able to reach these far-flung islands in their iconic canoes? What were the keys to their success? And perhaps most fascinating of all what drove groups of Polynesians to want to set sail in their iconic canoes into the vast and treacherous Pacific?</p><br><p>So many questions still surround the ancient history of Polynesia and their unparalleled voyaging across the vast Pacific Ocean and in this podcast I was delighted to be joined by Christina Thompson to talk me through this 'Puzzle of Polynesia'. From the iconic outrigger canoes to the canine animals they brought with them, she explains what we do know (and what are the theories) about the ancient Polynesians and their incredible voyages across the Pacific Ocean.</p><br><p>Christina is the author of: 'Sea Peoples: The Puzzle of Polynesia' and 'Come on Shore and We Will Kill and Eat You All'</p>"

Accompanied by a huge army and navy he crossed the Hellespont (modern day Dardanelles), intent on punishing the city-state of Athens and any other Hellenic powers that dared to resist. It was during this campaign that one of history's most famous battles was fought, at the Pass of Thermopylae in central Greece. King Leonidas, his 300 (or so) Spartans and their Hellenic allies fought off against King Xerxes' mighty Persian army for three days. To talk through this fascinating battle I'm chatting with Paul Cartledge, a professor from the University of Cambridge and one of the World's leading experts on ancient Sparta. In this fascinating chat, Paul sorts the fact from the fiction about the doomed Thermopylae defence. He starts by explaining the conflict's background, before moving on to the battle itself.

Accompanied by a huge army and navy he crossed the Hellespont (modern day Dardanelles), intent on punishing the city-state of Athens and any other Hellenic powers that dared to resist.

                "summary": "Plague in the ancient world was nothing unusual. Bouts of illness were common occurrences, but we do have accounts of some exceptional outbreaks: epidemics that brought powerful empires and city-states to their knees. One of the most infamous occurred in 430 BC: the Plague of Athens. Recently I was fortunate enough to interview Alastair Blanshard, a Professor of Classics and Ancient History at the University of Queensland, about this devastating episode in Athenian history."
