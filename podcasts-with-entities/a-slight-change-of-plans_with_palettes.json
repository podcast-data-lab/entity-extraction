Maya is no stranger to change. \u201cMy whole childhood revolved around the violin, but that changed in a moment when I injured my hand playing a single note,\u201d says Shankar, who was studying under Itzhak Perlman at the Juilliard School at the time. \u201cI was forced to try and figure out who I was, and who I could be, without the violin.\" Maya soon discovered a new path in the field of cognitive science, where she earned her PhD as a Rhodes Scholar studying how and why we change. Her insights into human behavior ultimately led her to create A Slight Change of Plans\u2014Apple Podcasts\u2019 Best Show of the Year in 2021. You\u2019ll hear intimate conversations with people like Tiffany Haddish, Kacey Musgraves, and Riz Ahmed, as well as real-life inspirations, like John Elder Robison, who undergoes experimental brain stimulation to deepen his emotional intelligence, Daryl Davis, a Black jazz musician who inspires hundreds of KKK members to leave the Klan, and Shankar herself, who had her own \u201cslight change of plans\u201d earlier this year. The show also explores the science of change with experts like Adam Grant and Angela Duckworth. \"What I love most about this show is that the content is evergreen,\" says Shankar. \"You can listen to episodes in any order and at any time.\"</p>",

Maya is no stranger to change. \u201cMy whole childhood revolved around the violin, but that changed in a moment when I injured my hand playing a single note,\u201d says Shankar, who was studying under Itzhak Perlman at the Juilliard School at the time. \u201cI was forced to try and figure out who I was, and who I could be, without the violin.\" Maya soon discovered a new path in the field of cognitive science, where she earned her PhD as a Rhodes Scholar studying how and why we change. Her insights into human behavior ultimately led her to create A Slight Change of Plans\u2014Apple Podcasts\u2019 Best Show of the Year in 2021. You\u2019ll hear intimate conversations with people like Tiffany Haddish, Kacey Musgraves, and Riz Ahmed, as well as real-life inspirations, like John Elder Robison, who undergoes experimental brain stimulation to deepen his emotional intelligence, Daryl Davis, a Black jazz musician who inspires hundreds of KKK members to leave the Klan, and Shankar herself, who had her own \u201cslight change of plans\u201d earlier this year. The show also explores the science of change with experts like Adam Grant and Angela Duckworth. \"What I love most about this show is that the content is evergreen,\" says Shankar. \"You can listen to episodes in any order and at any time.\""
