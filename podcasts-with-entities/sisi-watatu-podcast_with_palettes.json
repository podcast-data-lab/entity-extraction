At the end of each episode, you are assured of having a very new perspective, slightly weirded out perspective on some of life\u2019s bugging problems. Our motto? It\u2019s never that serious.",

Additionally, she works on production of a pop-show at Metropol Tv with the name E-magazine during the week and amazingly she is still booked during the weekend. Because apparently production isn\u2019t too amazing to us already, Evabrenda decided to be so good at editing content that she now works during the weekend with famous Kenyan comedian Nyambane (Walter Mong\u2019are) and Olive Gachara, CEO of Couture Africa. Under the two and a whole crew, they produce Nyambane\u2019s Kitchen, a show that creatively turns a cooking into an informative and entertaining talk show. Her past experience? Fam, that\u2019s just a lot. Listen to this episode as she narrates her incredible journey from doing theatre, to an intern at KUTV and is she 16 years or older?

At the end of each episode, you are assured of having a very new perspective, slightly weirded out perspective on some of life\u2019s bugging problems. Our motto?

She is currently working at Metropol TV, a premier business-focused Television station in the heart of Nairobi where she is involved in production of their daily live morning show. Additionally, she works on production of a pop-show at Metropol Tv with the name E-magazine during the week and amazingly she is still booked during the weekend. Because apparently production isn\u2019t too amazing to us already, Evabrenda decided to be so good at editing content that she now works during the weekend with famous Kenyan comedian Nyambane (Walter Mong\u2019are) and Olive Gachara, CEO of Couture Africa. Under the two and a whole crew, they produce Nyambane\u2019s Kitchen, a show that creatively turns a cooking into an informative and entertaining talk show. Her past experience? Fam, that\u2019s just a lot. Listen to this episode as she narrates her incredible journey from doing theatre, to an intern at KUTV and is she 16 years or older? Younger?\n\nABOUT THE HOST\nSisi Wata2 (The three of us) is a podcast curated and produced by three Kenyan millennials, Okayze, Lee and Jesse. In this space, we tackle issues that affect the Kenyan millennial. Every episode features a guest/guests who help the crew dissect key topics while gravitating towards the guests\u2019 career paths as a point of reference. At the end of each episode, you are assured of having a very new perspective, slightly weirded out perspective on some of life\u2019s bugging problems. Our motto? It\u2019s never that serious. www.sisiwatatu.com\n\nABOUT THE TITLE\nIn her Shoes is an episode where the crew tries to fit into Brenda\u2019s shoes as a producer to understand the creative geniuses behind production of content that we enjoy on a regular. You can as well call it an ode to her excellent work in the popular Kenyan TV show \u201cIn Your Shoes\u201d, that involves stepping into the daily life of a normal Kenyan at work to try and understand how they interact with the world around them.\n\nCREDITS\nProduced and Mixed by: Jesse Kimotho and Richard Okenye\nCreative Consultants: Lee Mwangi, Evabrenda Wathoni, Kelly Nyaboke\nVisuals and Sounds: Lilian Mora, Richard Okenye\nTheme Song: Jesse Kimotho, Richard Okenye, Lee Mwangi\nWebsite: Jesse Kimotho, Lee Mwangi\nSocial Media: Kelly Nyaboke, Lee Mwangi\nThanks: All Sisi Watatu Listeners.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/sisiwatatu/message",

In this space, we tackle issues that affect the Kenyan millenial. Every episode features a guest/guests who help the crew dissect key topics while gravitating towards the guests\u2019 career paths as a point of reference. At the end of each episode, you are assured of having a very new perspective, slightly weirded out perspective on some of life\u2019s bugging problems. Our motto? It\u2019s never that serious."
