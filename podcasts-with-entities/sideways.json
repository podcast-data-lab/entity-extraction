            "content": "James Campbell's family were unusual. They were the 'singing family'. Everyone on their street knew it - and heard it. They would sing at the drop of a hat and James' father had a barbershop quartet. \n\nEvery Monday evening James would listen attentively to the sumptuous close harmonies and his father taught him and his siblings to harmonise too. James took this into his adult years. It gave him a lifelong enjoyment and confidence to harmonise with other people, just for fun. One day, when his father is taken very ill, James realises the power of harmony at the hardest of times as he and his family join around his father's hospital bed to sing.\n\nIn this episode, Matthew Syed explores the importance of harmony and asks whether bringing in musical ideas could help bring us a little more harmony in our lives. We get a lesson in close harmony singing with folk trio Lady Maisery and consider how the principles of close listening could carry beyond a musical setting.\n\nAnd Matthew explores Plato's ideas about the soul in harmony with Professor Angie Hobbs, the Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield. And with Ian Cross, Emeritus Professor of Music and Science at the University of Cambridge, Matthew unravels the ways we communicate musically in conversation to signal agreement and to bond, showing the vital importance of musical interaction in bonding.\n\nPresenter: Matthew Syed\nProducer and Series Editor: Katherine Godfrey\nExecutive Producer: Max O'Brien\nMusic, Sound Design and Mix: Rob Speight\nTheme music by Ioana Selaru.\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4.",

Destined initially for agriculture or industry, when nature begins to take over, authorities decide to protect the new Earth as a nature reserve - the Oostvaardersplassen.\n\nIn this episode of Sideways, Matthew Syed uses the story of this pioneering nature reserve to reveal our conceptions, and misconceptions of the wild.\n\nRich with reedbeds, the oostvaardersplassen soon becomes a haven for rare birds. But Dutch ecologist Frans Vera wants to take the oostvaardersplassen further. He wants to test the theory that Europe wasn\u2019t covered with forest before humans arrived, but instead had vast grassy plains, much like the savannas of Africa. And so begins the introduction of herds of cattle, horses and deer to the reserve - a pioneering environmental effort which pre-dates the now familiar idea of rewilding.\n\nBut when the project stumbles into controversy, it tests our understanding of the wild and how we look after it. And as opposition to the Oostvaardersplassen begins to shape its future, the heady dream of a self-sufficient Dutch serengeti is abandoned.

Stopping a moment to take a look, Bill beheld a sight that would change the course of his life. At the wheel was a ceramics teacher, Mr Frank Ross, spinning a lump of clay into a beautiful bowl. He was witnessing a profound metaphor - he could make his life into something beautiful as Mr Ross made bowls from clay. \n\nMr Ross had lit a fuse within Bill. He went onto university and eventually set up the Manchester Craftsmen\u2019s Guild, an afterschool arts programme in his neighbourhood of North Side, Pittsburgh. The programme is designed to intercept the often difficult lives of teenagers in the area, to put them on a path toward a positive future with the help of inspirational teachers. \n\nAnd it works. Thousands of kids come through the programme each year and Bill\u2019s work has been recognised by the White House, among others. \n\nMatthew Syed explores how teachers have the power to transform the world, one student at a time. It\u2019s a big responsibility taken seriously by the likes of history teacher Shalina Patel.

Struggling with mental health issues, feeling like they had to suppress their femininity in some contexts, their Arab identity in others, it was a relief to take a break from it all and get into the mindset of a fearless woman who didn\u2019t give a damn. But soon, Glamrou became so much for than an act. \n\nAs Matthew discovers, alter egos might start out feeling like role play, but they have the power to transform us in profound and lasting ways. And it turns out that some of the most successful people around have used them to get the edge, from Beyonc\u00e9 to Rafael Nadal.\n\nBut the benefits of alter egos aren\u2019t limited to the stage or the sports field.

His new book lies ready to be pulped.\n\nIn the first of a new series of Sideways, Matthew Syed asks why we\u2019re doomed to be unoriginal and why it hurts so much to be, well, not that special.\n\nIn 1998, Hollywood directors Matthew Bay and Mimi Leder went head to head with suspiciously similar disaster movies -  Armageddon and Deep Impact. Allegations of late-night spying flew around. But could there have just been something in the air? Matthew reveals that, four years earlier, fragments of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 Comet smashed into Jupiter and right into the American consciousness.\n\nThis is the thing... As Matthew discovers, our brains are wired for unoriginality, we evolve as a collective brain, absorbing our shared cultural cues and looking for what has worked in the past. But if that\u2019s the norm, why do we feel so disappointed when our ideas seem unoriginal, when someone else beats us to it? And is there a way out of this - to rekindle our originality?\n\nWith author Ian Leslie, Kristen Lopez, TV editor for Indiewire and pop culture critic, Dr Michael Muthukrishna, Associate Professor of Economic Psychology at the London School of Economics and Nick Groom, Professor of Literature in English, University of Macau.\n\nPresenter: Matthew Syed\nProducer/Series Editor: Katherine Godfrey\nExecutive Producer: Max O'Brien\nMusic, Sound Design and Mix: Nicholas Alexander\nResearch and Development: Gavin Haynes and Madeleine Parr\nTheme Music: Seventy Times Seven by Ioana Selaru\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4",
