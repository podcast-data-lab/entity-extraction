                "summary": "SUMMARY\nThe Sandbox's Sebastien Borget joins Kevin to discuss the practical use of blockchains and NFTs for securing digital property and rewarding creators in virtual gaming worlds.\n\nBIO\nSebastien Borget @borgetsebastien is the Co-Founder and COO of The Sandbox, a decentralized gaming virtual world, and President of The Blockchain Game Alliance, advocating for NFTs and blockchain in games.\n\nLINKS\nAll episode links can be found here.\n\nSHOW NOTES\nHow two big shifts in the gaming world are being addressed by blockchains and NFTs. [00:46]\nSebastien shares his background of nearly 14 years as a serial entrepreneur, and what catalyzed his work to merge gaming with the decentralized world of crypto that resulted in The Sandbox we see today. [03:04]\nCurrently, what parts of The Sandbox are centralized and decentralized, and how long does Sebastien project it will take for full decentralization? [05:51]\nIn The Sandbox, to what extent can a creator give life to what their imagination dreams up? [06:45]\nHow are additional attributes (like speed, power, and defense) extended onto a static, LEGO block-style creation in The Sandbox, and who defines these attributes? Is there a way for a community to be involved in these definitions if the creator wishes to allow it? [08:39]\nThe unforeseen benefits of opening up feature definition to a community. [11:31]\nWhat kind of game is a first-timer to The Sandbox expected to play, and how can this be modified? For instance, is participation in player-vs-player content mandatory, or are there places in The Sandbox where a player can choose to opt-out? [12:36]\n\u00a0How does real estate ownership and property value work in The Sandbox? Will new land be generated over time, or has a limited inventory been established? [14:51]\nHow big are parcels of land in The Sandbox, and how long would it take to \"walk\" across one of these parcels? Does this size in any way limit an owner's capacity to create? [17:32]\nWhat was the base price for a new parcel of land when The Sandbox began, how has it fluctuated, and what factors might have an impact on a parcel's value? [19:08]\nHow is the $SAND token being used, and how can it be acquired? [20:33]\n\u00a0What is a game jam, how can interested parties participate in The Sandbox's game jam, and what coding languages do they need to know? [22:26]\nIn what ways can people start interacting, creating, and trading in The Sandbox today? When will The Sandbox officially go live? [23:48]\nWill creators be able to bring external projects into The Sandbox, like existing NFTs (e.g. CryptoPunks)? [26:07]\nHow does The Sandbox differentiate itself from competing projects in this space? [26:48]\nDoes someone need to own land in The Sandbox today to begin creating content for it, and will that content vanish when the official launch takes place? [29:39]\nWill everything in The Sandbox be tied to the Ethereum blockchain, or is this expected to change? [30:18]\nWhat's the best way for someone to stay up to date with The Sandbox's developments? [31:50]\nWhy I reached out to Sebastien to share what's going on with The Sandbox, how you can keep in touch with him, and parting thoughts. [33:27]"

Here's how. [01:08]\n\nBram's original concept for Chia. [02:56]\n\nProof of work vs. proof of space and time in cryptocurrency, and why Bram favors one over the other. [04:15]\n\nUnderstanding the mechanics of how this works in layman's terms. [06:10]\n\nBitcoin mining, ASIC chips, and the cost of electricity. [07:25]\n\nHow Chia farming is more sustainable and available to the average user than Bitcoin mining, and what it's doing in the process. [08:30]\n\nWhat is the plot file, and what\u2019s in it? [09:57]\n\nBram explains how \"Timelords\" operate in Chia farming. [10:30]\n\nWhere do the winning \u201cbingo\u201d numbers come from? [12:45]\n\nWhat\u2019s the smallest amount of hard drive space someone needs to start farming Chia? [13:19]\n\nWhat is the mechanism behind Chia farming? What happens to the data? [14:21]\n\nHow is a farmer rewarded for their contribution? [15:52]\n\nHow does the network process and handle transactions? [16:39]\n\nHow should people think of this coin? What is it used for? [17:59]\n\nThere won't be any transactions at mainnet launch. Here's why. [19:22]\n\nHow many transactions per second will the Chia network eventually be able to support? [20:48]\n\nHow Chia will be able to support smart transactions better than Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. [22:25]\n\nWhat is a colored coin?
