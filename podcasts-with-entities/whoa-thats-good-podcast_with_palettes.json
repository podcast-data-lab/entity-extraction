Nate remembers the early days in Atlanta where Housefires began and the moment he says was \"the most special moment in worship he's ever seen\" when \"Good Good Father\" was first spoken \u2014 and he has Sadie saying, \"That's SO good\" many times when he explains the origin of his first tattoo and how a two-degree shift can change EVERYTHING for you in your life!\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.trymiracle.com/whoa \u2014 Get 40% off + 3 FREE towels with code WHOA at checkout!\nhttps://athleticgreens.com/whoa \u2014 Get a FREE 1-year supply of Vitamin D & 5 FREE travel packs with your first purchase!\nhttps://www.auraframes.com \u2014 Get up to $30 off on Aura\u2019s best-selling frames when you use code WHOA at checkout!\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.

But the good news is that owning those mistakes \u2014 those vulnerabilities \u2014 is a way to reclaim your own life, and when you can, share those struggles with others! Sadie has a good method for determining if you're oversharing on social media. JP encourages us to turn our struggles into our story and turn our messes into our messages. You're not alone in whatever it is that looms large in your life, whether in secret or not. Sadie and JP share how their anxieties physically manifested in each of their lives and how far they've come to be able to talk freely and encourage others. Plus, can some forms of anxiety actually be a product of pride?

Sadie takes a closer look at all *those* analogies you might have heard in church, youth group, or even in Christian school. Wherever you are and whatever you've done in your past \u2014 or whatever has been done to you \u2014 Sadie and Korie encourage us that we are all made clean before God when we repent and trust in Him and accept His love and grace.

Tay speaks candidly about her time working as a nurse in recent years, how she realized she'd become so anxious and depressed that she needed to stop, and how she turned that experience, and subsequent PTSD, into a passion for helping other people with their mental health by starting Lemons by Tay. Sadie and Tay both share the moments they realized they were in a bad place and needed help and how to summon courage to ASK for help. Tay encourages us to celebrate small victories in BIG ways, and Sadie challenges us to choose to find joy in whatever situation you're in and, when possible, make bad things good!\u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.
