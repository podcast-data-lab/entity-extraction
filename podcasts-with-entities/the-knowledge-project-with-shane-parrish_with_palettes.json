            "contentSnippet": "In this episode of The Knowledge Project, I have the brilliant Robert Greene. Robert is the\n author of 5 New York Times bestsellers, including The 48 Laws of Power and The 33 Strategies of War. He's also written on mastery and seduction.\n Robert\u2019s books have been somewhat controversial over the years and have been called amoral, cunning, and even ruthless for what they reveal. Yet millions of readers, from mid-level managers to hip-hop royalty and corporate executives have revered his work as a sort of canonized scripture for the ambitious.\n In this conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including:\n  \nWhy Robert believes his first book, 48 Laws of Power has continued to sell steadily for over two decades.\n What Robert calls \u201calive time\u201d and \u201cdead time\u201d and how we can optimize each day to be filled with \u201calive time\u201d and live the life we\u2019re proud of\n The one skill that determines how far you\u2019ll get in life, no matter how talented you are in anything else\n Robert\u2019s research method and how he finds such unique and interesting examples\n What Robert looks for when he reads, and what qualities separate good books from excellent books\n How Robert developed his famous note card system to extract the meat out of anything he reads\n Why Robert insists on writing all his notes longhand even though it\u2019s less convenient and less accessible than taking notes digitally\n What Robert\u2019s daily routine looks like, particularly when he\u2019s writing and researching for a new book\n What Robert considers to be the single greatest power any human has, and what we can do to strengthen it\n How having unfettered access to information is actually making us dumber in very important ways and what we can do about it\n How to fine tune your \u201cbullshit detector\u201d so you\u2019re able to tell the difference between pretenders and performers. (As a bonus, Robert shares a few ways you can improve your bullshitting skills when it becomes necessary)\n  \nAnd a lot more.\n Plus, Robert gives us a sneak peek into his newest project,  The Laws of Human Nature, which explores the hidden motivations that drive what we do and say.\n This interview is packed to the brim with interesting and actionable insights that I think you\u2019re going to love. Grab a pen, a notebook, and a glass of wine and enjoy!\n \u00a0\n Go Premium: Members get early access, ad-free episodes, hand-edited transcripts, searchable transcripts, member-only episodes, and more.

If you\u2019ve purchased anything online recently, there\u2019s a good chance that Stripe facilitated the transaction.\n What is now an organization with over a thousand employees and handling tens of billions of dollars of online purchases every year, began as a small side experiment while Patrick and his brother John were going to college. \u00a0\n During our conversation, Patrick shares the details of their unlikely journey and some of the hard-earned wisdom he picked up along the way. I hope you have something handy to write with because the nuggets per minute in this episode are off the charts. Patrick was so open and generous with his responses that I\u2019m really excited for you to hear what he has to say.\n Here are just a few of the things we cover:\n  \nThe biggest (and most valuable) mistakes Patrick made in the early days of Stripe and how they helped him get better\n The characteristics that Patrick looks for in a new hire to fit and contribute to the Stripe company culture\n What compelled he and his brother to move forward with the early concept of Stripe, even though on paper it was doomed to fail from the start\n The gaps Patrick saw in the market that dozens of other processing companies were missing \u2014 and how he capitalized on them\n The lessons Patrick learned from scaling Stripe from two employees (he and his brother) to nearly 1,000 today\n How he evaluates the upsides and potential dangers of speculative positions within the company\n How his Irish upbringing influenced his ability to argue and disagree without taking offense (and how we can all be a little more \u201cIrish\u201d)\n The power of finding the right peer group in your social and professional circles and how impactful and influential it can be in determining where you end up.\n The 4 ways Patrick has modified his decision making process over the last 5 years and how it\u2019s helped him develop as a person and as a business leader (this part alone is worth the listen)\n Patrick\u2019s unique approach to books and how he chooses what he\u2019s going to spend his time reading\n  \n...life in Silicon Valley, Baumol\u2019s cost disease, and so, so much more.\n Patrick truly is one of the warmest, humblest and down-to-earth people I\u2019ve had the pleasure to speak with and I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation together.

We geek out on decision making, luck vs. skill, work life balance, and so much more.\n ***\n Michael Mauboussin is back as a returning guest on the Knowledge Project!\n He was actually the very first guest on the podcast when it was still very much an experiment. I enjoyed it so much, I decided to continue with the show. (If you missed his last interview, you can listen to it  here, or if you\u2019re a member of The Learning Community, you can download a transcript.)\n Michael is one of my very favorite people to talk to, and I couldn\u2019t wait to pick up right where we left off.\n In this interview, Michael and I dive deep into some of the topics we care most about here at Farnam Street, including:\n  \nThe concept of \u201cbase rates\u201d and how they can help us make far better decisions and avoid the pain and consequences of making poor choices.\n How to know where you land on the luck/skill continuum and why it matters\n Michael\u2019s advice on creating a systematic decision-making process in your organization to improve outcomes.\n The two most important elements of any decision-making process\n How to train your intuition to be one of your most powerful assets instead of a dangerous liability\n The three tests Michael uses in his company to determine the health and financial stability of his environment\n Why \u201calgorithm aversion\u201d is creating such headaches in many organizations and how to help your teams overcome it, so you can make more rapid progress\n The most impactful books that he\u2019s read since we last spoke, is reading habits, and the strategies he uses to get the most of every book\n The importance of sleep in Michael's\u2019 life to make sure his body and mind are running at peak efficiency\n His greatest failures and what he learned from them\n How Michael and his wife raised their kids and the unique parenting style they adopted\n How Michael defines happiness and the decisions he makes to maximize the joy in his life\n  \nAny one of those insights alone is worth a listen, so I think you\u2019re really going to enjoy this interview.\n Go Premium: Members get early access, ad-free episodes, hand-edited transcripts, searchable transcripts, member-only episodes, and more.
