    "description": "On 29th July 1981, while the eyes of the world are on London and captivated by the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, an eight-year-old boy disappears on his way home from the celebrations.  Despite a huge police search he is never seen alive again.  Seven months later his partial remains are discovered in a small patch of woodland in rural Sussex, many miles from home.  Forty years on, and despite the emergence of new evidence, no-one has been brought to justice for the abduction and death of Vishal Mehrotra and the police appear to have exhausted all their leads. Then one day, as the world is going into lockdown in 2020, a BBC local reporter receives a secretive message from a person who has worked within the police \u2013 they tell him they\u2019ve seen something extraordinary that could blow the case wide open. \n\nThat call sets in motion an epic true story - an astonishing podcast investigation, three years in the making, that has consequences no-one could have imagined.  As the team investigate they track down and question a convicted paedophile, a teacher who fled the UK while being questioned by police in relation to child sexual abuse in the 1990s and has been on the run across the world for over 25 years.  Most shocking of all, the series discovers that a UK police force had been aware for years he\u2019d been at the address and had decided not to try to bring him back - while telling Vishal\u2019s family that he hadn\u2019t been located.\n\nThe disappearance of Vishal Mehrotra is a case that haunts our age: a case that has repeatedly fallen through the cracks over 40 years \u2013 the cracks of our justice system, of our collective attention, of who we choose to listen to and who we don\u2019t. In this extraordinary podcast series, Vishal\u2019s 30 year old half-brother Suchin Mehrotra and investigative reporter Colin Campbell set out to gather the pieces and try to get answers.  What they uncover takes them deep into the disturbing underworld of what appears to be a completely separate crime - and sends them halfway across the globe in a search for the truth. Alongside a deeply moving personal story about the toll of this tragedy on one family across generations, what also emerges is a picture of all of us and the world we live in now.",

        "summary": "On 29th July 1981, while the eyes of the world are on London and captivated by the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, an eight-year-old boy disappears on his way home from the celebrations.  Despite a huge police search he is never seen alive again.  Seven months later his partial remains are discovered in a small patch of woodland in rural Sussex, many miles from home.  Forty years on, and despite the emergence of new evidence, no-one has been brought to justice for the abduction and death of Vishal Mehrotra and the police appear to have exhausted all their leads. Then one day, as the world is going into lockdown in 2020, a BBC local reporter receives a secretive message from a person who has worked within the police \u2013 they tell him they\u2019ve seen something extraordinary that could blow the case wide open. \n\nThat call sets in motion an epic true story - an astonishing podcast investigation, three years in the making, that has consequences no-one could have imagined.  As the team investigate they track down and question a convicted paedophile, a teacher who fled the UK while being questioned by police in relation to child sexual abuse in the 1990s and has been on the run across the world for over 25 years.  Most shocking of all, the series discovers that a UK police force had been aware for years he\u2019d been at the address and had decided not to try to bring him back - while telling Vishal\u2019s family that he hadn\u2019t been located.\n\nThe disappearance of Vishal Mehrotra is a case that haunts our age: a case that has repeatedly fallen through the cracks over 40 years \u2013 the cracks of our justice system, of our collective attention, of who we choose to listen to and who we don\u2019t. In this extraordinary podcast series, Vishal\u2019s 30 year old half-brother Suchin Mehrotra and investigative reporter Colin Campbell set out to gather the pieces and try to get answers.  What they uncover takes them deep into the disturbing underworld of what appears to be a completely separate crime - and sends them halfway across the globe in a search for the truth. Alongside a deeply moving personal story about the toll of this tragedy on one family across generations, what also emerges is a picture of all of us and the world we live in now."
