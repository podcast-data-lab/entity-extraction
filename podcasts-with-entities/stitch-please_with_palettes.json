This opened up the conversation as we talked about the exploitative nature of the fashion industry, why transparency doesn\u2019t equal sustainability, and the interlocking systems of oppression that coincide with capitalism. Aja also shares how consumers can use their collective power for positive change and why we need to start investigating our shopping habits so we can change how we participate in the system.This episode is an insightful lesson on the perils of fast fashion, the reasons why,as a society, we tie our happiness to consumerism, and how to make more sustainable and ethical choices with our clothes.

Kianga also talks about the opportunities she\u2019s received to travel around the world, furthering her craft in Ghana and South Africa. This opened up our conversation as we discussed Kianga\u2019s curiosity and hunger not just for living her everyday life as a Black woman, but also to learned and rediscover her ancestry and legacy through the mediums of art and literature. This episode is a true exploration of art, culture, and legacy. So tune in, get curious, and get inspired by this truly powerful conversation.",

The three of us reviewed what went well and what we could do better, so here\u2019s what you can expect from the 2022 mystery:</p><ul><li><strong>A Special Collector\u2019s Edition Tool Box with Swag (while supplies last)</strong> \u2013 <i>we know that getting something in the mail makes people feel more connected to the experience, and we want YOU to know that you\u2019re special to us too!

It was a magic moment, and her desire to trace the history and story of those quilts connected the invisible threads of time and the artistic revelation that happened in her family during the dark times of slavery. The \u201cThreads Across Time\u201d episode with Sarah Bond travels through time to more than a century ago and brings back a legacy of Quilt art by her enslaved ancestors. The fact that Sarah Bond still preserves those quilts portrays that they were not created just for utilitarian purposes. They were a product of love and expression.

My body confidence grew when I started sewing because I stopped limiting my wardrobe and made clothes that fit me well. I love to bring my Blackness and power in my photos of my makes. I am proud of my Blackness and being apart of the African Diaspora. In my makes and photoshoots I try my best to embody that pride because it shows the world who I am. Changing my name to reflect my ancestors roots was/is the most important thing I have ever done. When I changed my name to one that reflected who I am, and who I am to become, I felt whole. Like my pride, mindset, and personality matched with my name.\"</p>\n",

I am proud of my Blackness and being apart of the African Diaspora. In my makes and photoshoots I try my best to embody that pride because it shows the world who I am. Changing my name to reflect my ancestors roots was/is the most important thing I have ever done. When I changed my name to one that reflected who I am, and who I am to become, I felt whole.

If you know Kamali Obiagu from Instagram, you know that she radiates confidence in photos where she wears her impeccably stitched creations. Lisa talks with her about what it took to get to that place - discovering a sewing community (and PDF patterns!) and learning to love the body she\u2019s in today.

So, everyday I get to be a Therapist is a day that is both meaningful, and heavy to me. Sewing, on the other hand provides me with the freedom to be myself. It gives me a space to make mistakes and say exactly what I have to say, in the way I want to say it without consequence. That experience is so meaningful to my emotional and mental health. I have been a Marriage and Family Therapist, in private practice for 10 years By far, branching out on my own to become an entrepreneur of a sustainable business has been an awe inspiring event for me. Over the years, I/my business has been featured in publications like Parenting Magazine, Heart and Soul magazine, Counseling Today magazine, but my greatest accomplishment is the work that happens behind closed doors, with my people. I have only been sewing for 5 years but my sewing journey has provided me with so many opportunities to learn who I really am through the process of building my own self-esteem. I never would have imagined that 5 years ago, when my client gifted me an old sewing machine of hers, that I would become a Janome maker, be featured in Sewn magazine, have an opportunity to speak on a sewing related podcast or even become a coalition member of Black Makers Matter. I have learned that my perspective matters and I don't want to squander the opportunity to positively affect people, either through sewing or through my therapeutic intervention. To me, there is nothing more meaningful than that!\"</p><p>Her upcoming project is the relaunch of Relationship Rocket Science: I am so excited to be relaunching my Relationship Rocket Science brand which is geared toward teaching people how to create the lives they want through their relationships. I am an educator at heart, so it is very important to me that my people walk away from me with tools and skills that will allow them to execute what they have learned successfully. For this reason, I will soon be releasing a series of workbooks that will address healing oneself, communication skill building and, dating and marriage tools for success. I realize that I cannot be everyone's therapist, so I'm using Relationship Rocket Science to touch as many people as I can in a variety of ways. I love to answer people's questions about love and all kinds of relationships, so My Relationship Rocket Science advice column podcast is in the planning stages and will be up and running soon. I'm so excited about all of it!</p>\n",

I put my family and job ahead of my own needs, got real efficient at \"running shit\", and further away from my creativity. Garment sewing and writing stories about it on my blog had become my main self-care practice because it was freeing me from an adulthood of ill-fitting ready-to-wear (I am short and curvy) and fully engaged my brain and hands in something meant just for me. When I stopped keeping and making sewing promises to myself, I was determined to find out why and began a quiet journey of self-examination. I re-read the book by bell hooks that saved me in college, Sisters of the Yam: Black Women & Self-Recovery and began some much needed inner work and healing. The process is on-going. When the pandemic hit, I was triggered back into SBM mode. This time I recognized it! Those lost sewjo feelings were my call to action. I reached out to the sewing community, found out I wasn't alone and started writing, plugging holes in my self-care, and therapy-sewing my way out of the shadows. I called it my Sewjo Reclamation Project and immediately created my first sewing social media meme with an image from the movie, How Stella Got Her Groove Back. From there, I decided to self-publish my first writings as a for-profit ebook instead of on my blog. This is a transition for my platform that aligned with my 2019 transition to independent consulting from 20 years in the tech industry. The first chapter of my ebook is called \"3 Reasons Why Passionate Women Lose Their Sewing Mojo\" and is available for free download by my email subscribers. They will be the first to know when the ebook is available for purchase in September. To bring awareness to my Sewjo Reclamation Project, I have also begun live-streaming answers to questions from the sewing community about sewjo reclamation to my Instagram followers. Sharing my ideas, stories, and vulnerabilities has been its own healing experience. My intention is to help other passionate women reclaim their sewjo by transforming their craft into a ritual of self-care.</p>\n",

I put my family and job ahead of my own needs, got real efficient at \"running shit\", and further away from my creativity. Garment sewing and writing stories about it on my blog had become my main self-care practice because it was freeing me from an adulthood of ill-fitting ready-to-wear (I am short and curvy) and fully engaged my brain and hands in something meant just for me. When I stopped keeping and making sewing promises to myself, I was determined to find out why and began a quiet journey of self-examination. I re-read the book by bell hooks that saved me in college, Sisters of the Yam: Black Women & Self-Recovery and began some much needed inner work and healing. The process is on-going. When the pandemic hit, I was triggered back into SBM mode. This time I recognized it! Those lost sewjo feelings were my call to action. I reached out to the sewing community, found out I wasn't alone and started writing, plugging holes in my self-care, and therapy-sewing my way out of the shadows. I called it my Sewjo Reclamation Project and immediately created my first sewing social media meme with an image from the movie, How Stella Got Her Groove Back. From there, I decided to self-publish my first writings as a for-profit ebook instead of on my blog. This is a transition for my platform that aligned with my 2019 transition to independent consulting from 20 years in the tech industry. The first chapter of my ebook is called \"3 Reasons Why Passionate Women Lose Their Sewing Mojo\" and is available for free download by my email subscribers. They will be the first to know when the ebook is available for purchase in September. To bring awareness to my Sewjo Reclamation Project, I have also begun live-streaming answers to questions from the sewing community about sewjo reclamation to my Instagram followers. Sharing my ideas, stories, and vulnerabilities has been its own healing experience. My intention is to help other passionate women reclaim their sewjo by transforming their craft into a ritual of self-care.</p>\n",
