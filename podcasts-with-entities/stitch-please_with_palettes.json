The idea that you could look at clothes in a store and say I like this thing about it, but I don't like that thing about it. Instead of saying, let me see if I can buy another thing that looks like what I want, you said, let me see if I can make it.\u201d - Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #208</li><li>\u201cThat's how I think I sort of look at sewing patterns, right? Like you have a pattern and you have this 2D piece of tissue or paper or 2D flat fabric and then you turn it into this three-dimensional object. And so I think that transfers very similarly to me. Like when we look at someone's outfit and we say, oh my God, that's so cute and we immediately start like deconstructing it in our heads so we can put it back together for us later. I think my engineering brain is just very attuned to doing that.\u201d - Tiffany Turner, Stitch Please, Episode #208</li><li>\u201cI feel like one of the contributions that I appreciate about your work, Tiffany is how you are. Like, it's like you're a big cheerleader for sewing and you're not, yeah, you're not just gonna say ra ra, I love sewing. You say all that, but then you also equip people for success. and I see that in your channel.\u201d - Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #208</li><li>\u201cI really love the way you think about structure and the way you think about planning. I love all of that. I love templates. I love like, OK, these are the three steps I know I have to do every single time, that just makes me, it just gives me a sense of confidence, you know, like I might not be able to get to the exact outcome as I might envision it right now.

Like you have a pattern and you have this 2D piece of tissue or paper or 2D flat fabric and then you turn it into this three-dimensional object. And so I think that transfers very similarly to me. Like when we look at someone's outfit and we say, oh my God, that's so cute and we immediately start like deconstructing it in our heads so we can put it back together for us later.

Grace shares her journey into sewing, which began as a way to keep her mind active after moving to the United States (US) with her one-year-old child. Growing up in Nigeria, Grace had been exposed to her mother's sewing, but it wasn't until later that she truly delved into the craft.\u00a0</p><p>Grace's sewing journey began with an old treadle machine but when she moved to the US, she acquired an electric sewing machine, making her sewing experience more accessible. Her early projects were primarily for herself and her son, driven by a desire to connect with her Nigerian heritage.\u00a0</p><p>As Grace's sewing skills grew, so did her interest in different types of fabrics. She now offers a wide range of fabrics on her website, including Knit Ankara, Silk Adire, and Kampala. Grace provides insights into the cultural significance and unique characteristics of each fabric type, shedding light on their origins and traditional uses.\u00a0</p><p>Grace's approach to designing garments is influenced by her desire to celebrate the diversity of African fashion. She emphasizes the importance of allowing the fabric to speak for itself and encourages people to experiment with different styles and fabric combinations. Grace actively builds a sense of community among her customers through sew-alongs and challenges. These events provide opportunities for individuals to explore their creativity and gain confidence in working with African fabrics.\u00a0</p><p>The podcast episode concludes with Grace expressing her aspiration to flood the streets with African prints and her dedication to empowering others to embrace and incorporate these fabrics into their own creations.

Do not miss out on your chance to \u00a0and get your stitch together with a year of artistic inspiration!\nIn this episode of the Stitch Please podcast, Lisa interviews Grace Christopher, the creative genius behind African Zesty Couture. Grace shares her journey into sewing, which began as a way to keep her mind active after moving to the United States (US) with her one-year-old child. Growing up in Nigeria, Grace had been exposed to her mother's sewing, but it wasn't until later that she truly delved into the craft.\u00a0\nGrace's sewing journey began with an old treadle machine but when she moved to the US, she acquired an electric sewing machine, making her sewing experience more accessible. Her early projects were primarily for herself and her son, driven by a desire to connect with her Nigerian heritage.\u00a0\nAs Grace's sewing skills grew, so did her interest in different types of fabrics. She now offers a wide range of fabrics on her website, including Knit Ankara, Silk Adire, and Kampala. Grace provides insights into the cultural significance and unique characteristics of each fabric type, shedding light on their origins and traditional uses.\u00a0\nGrace's approach to designing garments is influenced by her desire to celebrate the diversity of African fashion. She emphasizes the importance of allowing the fabric to speak for itself and encourages people to experiment with different styles and fabric combinations. Grace actively builds a sense of community among her customers through sew-alongs and challenges. These events provide opportunities for individuals to explore their creativity and gain confidence in working with African fabrics.\u00a0\nThe podcast episode concludes with Grace expressing her aspiration to flood the streets with African prints and her dedication to empowering others to embrace and incorporate these fabrics into their own creations. The conversation exemplifies the rich cultural tapestry that sewing can encompass, and the potential for creativity to connect people across continents.\nSign up for the Black Women Stitch quarterly newsletter\nCheck out our merch here\nLeave a BACKSTITCH message and tell us about your favorite episode.\nJoin the Black Women Stitch Patreon\nCheck out our Amazon Store\n\nGrace Christopher\nGrace Christopher's journey is an extraordinary fusion of law and creative passion. Initially drawn to law, she devoted years to her legal career. However, her early exposure to her mother's sewing ignited a lasting passion. From her mother's vintage machine to crafting her own garments as a teenager, Grace's creativity found its roots. A move to the US and motherhood rekindled her love for sewing, inspiring her to blend her Nigerian heritage with her creative passion for sewing. Grace's designs breathe life into African fabrics, infusing them with modern flair. Through approachable teaching and challenges, she cultivates a community of creatives, aiming to saturate the streets with African fashion. As a mother, business owner, and designer, Grace exemplifies the transformative power of self-expression and celebrates the beauty of diversity.\n\u00a0\nLisa Woolfork\nLisa Woolfork is an associate professor of English specializing in African American literature and culture. Her teaching and research explore Black women writers, Black identity, trauma theory, and American slavery. She is the founder of Black Women Stitch, the sewing group where Black lives matter. She is also the host/producer of Stitch Please, a weekly audio podcast that centers on Black women, girls, and femmes in sewing. In the summer of 2017, she actively resisted the white supremacist marches in her community, Charlottesville, Virginia. The city became a symbol of lethal resurging white supremacist violence.

Imagine walking around and only feeling good enough to wear a sack... as opposed to being able to see your body as being beautiful enough to actually adorn it.\" - Aaronica B. Cole, Stitch Please, Episode #206\n\"I think what I've been thinking a lot about is a lot of the knowledge systems that have been developed for sewing in particular and for fashion by extension, were never made with black bodies in mind, period done. And it is, I think a flaw, a type of little flaw in the industry that started as something small in the 1940s but has never changed.\" - Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #206\n\"And so it's become in my mind malignant. I find it malignant and I find it very negative, right? When we look at size charts, when we look at what proportions are supposed to be, but those were designed by, they looked only at the bodies of white women.\" - Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #206\n\"Why should I look at this mainstream over here when, in fact, I am the mainstream.\" - Aaronica B. Cole, Stitch Please, Episode #206\n\"I think that for too long marginalized people, the process of marginalization requires that we set aside what feels good and right to us because it's not what the majority does but that it's ridiculous. It's kind of like trying to make sure that you can fit in somebody else's clothes, right? We, we make our own clothes because we want things to fit us.\" - Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #206\n\"I'm always talking about possibility models. It is important. It is hard for you to become that which you have never seen and you are visible out in the world doing amazing things and the victory is in the visibility and you have absolutely every right to be.\" - Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #206\n\u00a0\nResources Mentioned:\n\nPatterns for Pirates\nBernina (Sewing machine brand)\nAfros & Audio (Organization)\nBlack Podcasters Association\nBlack Podcast Awards\nWomen of Color Podcast (Organization)\n\nStay Connected:\nYouTube: Black Women Stitch\nInstagram: Black Women Stitch\nFacebook: Stitch Please Podcast\nLisa Woolfork\nInstagram: Lisa Woolfork\nTwitter: Lisa Woolfork\n\u00a0\nAaronica B.

You\u2019re using different fabrics and even if you use some of the same fabrics, it would be different outcomes. If you use some of the same shapes, it will look a bit different\u201d \u2013 <strong>Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #204</strong></li><li>\u201cJust do it! Just try it! Even if you are scared, like, I was scared to death to start bags, but I just did it. The first one, very questionable, but I did it. And the second part to that, is \u201cTake your time!\u201d. I am doing a bag right now and it\u2019s taking me forever. I think Nikki asked about it on one of my Tiktoks. It\u2019s fifty million pieces, but I\u2019m not a quitter, so I\u2019m gonna finish that bag.

Clemons is a YoungArts alumni and is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree from Rhode Island School of Design.\nInsights from this episode:\n\nHow to go from \u2018sketch\u2019 to \u2018stitch\u2019\nThe techniques behind textile manipulation\nThe importance of defining your purpose when doing creative work\nTips for overcoming your fear of making mistakes and taking chances\nBeing creative when you don\u2019t have a lot of resources\n\nQuotes from the show:\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m a very conceptual person when it comes to making, and I think it always starts off with the story. Mainly I think the core aspect of that is making it personal and authentic to my journey as not just an artist, but as a person.\u201d \u2013 Sahara Clemons, Stitch Please, Episode #202 [05:53]\n\u201cI think too often we think about sewing or fashion and manufacturing, but that\u2019s not all that you\u2019re doing and this is one of the reasons I think that fashion is art. The same things that we see in art, or the things that go into making art, go into making the garments that we ultimately see.\u201d \u2013 Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #202 [08:51]\n\u201cWhat I appreciate about fashion is that idea of community-building and bringing people into the clothing.\u201d \u2013 Sahara Clemons, Stitch Please, Episode #202 [11:35]\n\u201cI wanted the collection to go through the transition of a person\u2019s mindset when it comes to body exploration\u2026 knowing that it is a healing process rather than, \u2018this is okay, my scars are okay.\u2019 With all of society and you yourself, it\u2019s hard to feel that way and it\u2019s really challenging to go through that process, and that\u2019s what I wanted to share. That it\u2019s more about this healing and embracing a new perspective of yourself rather than an immediate dopamine rush of what it is, because it is hard sometimes to let go.\u201d \u2013 Sahara Clemons, Stitch Please, Episode #202 [25:40]\n\u201cI paralleled [pearls] with this idea of feeling like your body is an antagonizing force. Seeing how you can turn that around and how that creates in yourself this beauty and thing you have to overcome with yourself is a powerful journey that ends up being very beautiful.\u201d \u2013 Sahara Clemons, Stitch Please, Episode #202 [35:40]\n\nResources Mentioned:\n\nSahara\u2019s first appearance on the Stitch Please podcast\nSupima Design Competition\nCLO computer-assisted 3D design program\n\nThis week\u2019s episode is sponsored by AccuQuilt\nStay Connected:\nYouTube: Black Women Stitch\nInstagram: Black Women Stitch\nFacebook: Stitch Please Podcast\nLisa Woolfork\nInstagram: Lisa Woolfork\nTwitter: Lisa Woolfork\nSahara Clemons\nWebsite: Sahara Clemons\nInstagram: sgcoriginals\nSubscribe to our podcast + download each episode on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.\nThis episode was produced and managed by\n\u00a0Podcast Laundry\n.",

Her teaching and research explore Black women writers, Black identity, trauma theory, and American slavery. She is the founder of Black Women Stitch, the sewing group where Black lives matter. She is also the host/producer of Stitch Please, a weekly audio podcast that centers on Black women, girls, and femmes in sewing. In the summer of 2017, she actively resisted the white supremacist marches in her community, Charlottesville, Virginia. The city became a symbol of lethal resurging white supremacist violence. She remains active in a variety of university and community initiatives, including the Community Engaged Scholars program. She believes in the power of creative liberation.\n\u00a0\nBisa Butler\nBisa Butler is an award winning African American textile artist known for her vibrantly stunning larger than life sized quilted portraits that captivate viewers around the world. Formally trained, Butler graduated Cum Laude from Howard University with a Bachelor\u2019s in Fine Art degree and it was during this time that she began to experiment with fabric as a medium and became interested in collage techniques. She then went on to earn a Master\u2019s in Art from Montclair State University in 2005. While in the process of obtaining her Master\u2019s degree, Butler took a Fiber Arts class where she had an artistic epiphany and she finally realized how to express her art.\u00a0 \u201cAs a child, I was always watching my mother and grandmother sew, and they taught me. After that class, I made a portrait quilt for my grandmother on her deathbed, and I have been making art quilts ever since.\u201d\nAfter working as a high school art teacher for thirteen years, Butler was awarded a Gordon Parks Foundation Fellowship in 2002 and exhibited in Switzerland during Art Basel with the Jeffrey Deitch Gallery. Many institutions and museums have acquired Butler\u2019s work including the Art Institute of Chicago for a solo exhibition, The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, and The Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\n\u00a0\nInsights from this episode:\n\nWhy it\u2019s important to uplift and encourage each other, starting with the children in our lives\nHow Bisa uses her art to affirm the dignity of historical figures\nThe process of researching historical figures and time periods to accurately portray them through art\nHow different colors play into the meaning expressed in her art\nHow Bisa infuses her quilts with the music she\u2019s listening to as she creates\nWhat happens when you stop starting with \u2018white\u2019 as a default\nInsights into the difference between studying art education (teaching people how to make art) vs. learning how to make art yourself\n\nQuotes from the show:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always seeking for truth and to find those essential truth elements about Black people.\u201d \u2013 Bisa Butler, Stitch Please, Episode #200\n\u201cI have had people ask me, people who don\u2019t necessarily look like us so they don\u2019t have a full understanding, \u2018I notice that you make all of your subjects look regal. Why, or what\u2019s the process of that?\u2019 I would say I\u2019m just looking at them and this is the way they appear to me. I\u2019m not trying to make them look regal; if anything maybe it\u2019s just that you\u2019re looking at them more carefully. The dignity or that inner regality, I can\u2019t give it to them; they have it already.\u201d \u2013 Bisa Butler, Stitch Please, Episode #200\n\u201cMy interest in colorism is why the features look very African American. I don\u2019t want to dilute that in any way. I\u2019m loving our full lips, broad noses, or whatever the case may be.\u201d \u2013 Bisa Butler, Stitch Please, Episode #200\n\u201cI love that word \u2018talisman\u2019 because it acknowledges that spiritual resonance and also having a mantra. We\u2019ve always been very spiritual people and we\u2019ve always been people who have to think hopefully and we have to think about the world beyond us or even after us. A lot of times we have to pray for our living relatives who we may not be able to protect in the way that we want to.\u201d \u2013 Bisa Butler, Stitch Please, Episode #200\n\u201cMusic is such a strong form of communication; it\u2019s such a strong form of art because you don\u2019t need words, you just need to hear the sound to understand somebody\u2019s emotional output. The composer, musician, they can make you feel sad, they can make you feel happy, they can make your heartbeat go faster, they can make you go to sleep. That\u2019s a control of power that can be passed down through the ages. The music, as long as it\u2019s in a form that you can hear, you can hear how somebody felt hundreds of years before you.\u201d \u2013 Bisa Butler, Stitch Please, Episode #200\n\u201cThe music to me is more than an aid; it\u2019s the explanation.\u201d \u2013 Bisa Butler, Stitch Please, Episode #200\n\u201cFor Black Women Stitch and the Stitch Please podcast we center Black women, girls, and femmes in sewing to make a deliberate choice to center Blackness.

Sarah shares her poignant journey of collaboration; connecting with living family members like e bond, and also honoring the powerful legacies of ancestral women, such as Lavinia, her great-great-grandmother born into slavery in 1858, and Jane, born in 1828. Through the art of quilting, both navigate visual and auditory dialogues, reflecting on the essence of Black aliveness in a world that often places demands on Black identity. Highlighted in the episode is the Lavinia Unbound quilt, as well as e bond's \"Glyphs\" collection, an ode to sci-fi genius, Octavia Butler. The episode's pinnacle is the discussion of an 1870s basket quilt, capturing the spirit and audacity of Black women.

As a podcast geek with a commitment to increasing visibility and access for people of color, she co-founded #PodinLiveNYC, the largest annual Black podcast meetup in the world.

In the summer of 2017, she actively resisted the white supremacist marches in her community, Charlottesville, Virginia. The city became a symbol of lethal resurging white supremacist violence.

On purpose you\u2019re made to think there\u2019s not enough for everyone, so you don\u2019t ask for more. If there\u2019s not enough, you won\u2019t ask for more. If there\u2019s not enough, you won\u2019t require more. If there\u2019s not enough, you won\u2019t expect more. That\u2019s just what is stuck down your throat as a marginalized person. So it is really important for us to remind everyone that the market can never be saturated. That language in itself is exclusionary to make you not want to do this, to make you think it\u2019s not possible for you to be in a space.\u201d \u2013 Queen, Stitch Please, Episode #195</li><li>\u201cPeople don\u2019t think of all the players in capitalism and how invested corporations are in keeping independent creators, entrepreneurs, out of this space\u2026 They want to control the market, so they will tell you the market is flooded until they\u2019re ready to play. There\u2019s a lot at work to keep individuals from playing whatever the game is.\u201d \u2013 J., Stitch Please, Episode #195</li><li>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of that trying to maintain the status quo, and that is a symptom and a function of maintaining the capitalisty, and all of these little things work to the benefit of those on top of the financial hierarchy that we have, and that is power.\u201d \u2013 J., Stitch Please, Episode #195</li><li>\u201cI think the question to ask is \u2018who benefits?\u2019. If you count yourself out, if you take yourself out of the game before you give yourself a chance, who benefits from that? You are not benefitting, because you're not following something you\u2019re excited about. Don\u2019t count yourself out. Don\u2019t push yourself out because you\u2019re afraid.\u201d \u2013 Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #195</li><li>\u201cWhen I started this podcast, it was just like when I created Black Women Stitch. I built what I needed. I needed to know that there were other Black women, girls, and femmes out in the world doing things with needle and thread, that I did not have to turn to these sources that were crafted by white people for the benefit of other white people but told to me like \u2018yes, you can do it too, but if it doesn\u2019t fit you, then something\u2019s wrong.\u2019 None of that is the case. There absolutely is not just a history of us in this tradition, but also us being great innovators and making things that are completely new. And to also leave something behind for those who will come next and make sure that door is propped wide open for more flourishing to continue beyond just what\u2019s happening right now. I think that anything we can do to make that more of a regular practice would be to the good. I really do.\u201d \u2013 Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #195</li><li>\u201cNone of us are free unless all of us are free. I don\u2019t understand how we don\u2019t appreciate that. You don\u2019t get to just be a little bit racist. You don\u2019t get to be a little bit oppressive of other people because it makes you feel better or because you think you have good reason for it. That is not the way to wholeness.

Creating safe, nourishing spaces for Black femmes and folks impacted by misogynoir through digital media and live events is her style of activism. She is one half of The Tea with Queen and J. podcast and centers dismantling white supremacist patriarchal capitalism, because why the fuck not! Always encouraging healthy community building, her podcast\u2019s annual Black podcast meetup, #PodinLiveNYC, has grown into the largest Black podcaster meetup in the world! Ms.Vixen, her online magazine, has been running 7 years strong, and with the addition of live events and workshops through the Ms.Vixen IRL series, plus Ms. Vixen The Podcast, she continues to deliver incisive, witty, lit womanist perspectives on pop culture, media, and politics. Queen\u2019s work has also been featured at Afropunk.com, AMny, and you can catch her as a panelist on the youtube series, The Grapevine. Always someone with something to say, her goal is media domination, to always have huge hair, and to always stay fly.\n\u00a0\nJ.\nJ. is a cultural critic, podcast producer, and a womanist race nerd from the Bronx focused on dismantling white supremacist patriarchal capitalism while laughing, drinking tea, and indulging in various forms of Black joy. For over five years she's created audio content centering Black women and Black femme-identifying individuals, exploring America's caste system, allowing herself to learn and be challenged publicly, and sharing her journey through mental health. As a podcast geek with a commitment to increasing visibility and access for people of color, she co-founded #PodinLiveNYC, the largest annual Black podcast meetup in the world. In addition to freedom and liberation, Janicia loves cosplay, believes there's a special place in her heart (and hell) for body paint, and lovingly asks that you do not call her a \"lady\".\n\u00a0\nLisa Woolfork\nLisa Woolfork is an associate professor of English specializing in African American literature and culture. Her teaching and research explore Black women writers, Black identity, trauma theory, and American slavery. She is the founder of Black Women Stitch, the sewing group where Black lives matter. She is also the host/producer of Stitch Please, a weekly audio podcast that centers on Black women, girls, and femmes in sewing. In the summer of 2017, she actively resisted the white supremacist marches in her community, Charlottesville, Virginia. The city became a symbol of lethal resurging white supremacist violence. She remains active in a variety of university and community initiatives, including the Community Engaged Scholars program. She believes in the power of creative liberation.\n\u00a0\nInsights from this episode:\n\nMaking spaces like music festivals feel more welcoming to queer folks\nCreating intergenerational events that appeal to everyone and avoid ageism\nThe effect of marginalized people thinking from a scarcity mindset\nWho gets their work published and why\nWhy it\u2019s important to remember that there is always room for your voice and your story\nThe role of capitalism in holding us back from pursuing our interests\n\n\u00a0\nQuotes from the show:\n\n\u201cThe community activated to provide a kind of care, and I think that is something that you really can\u2019t harness or you can\u2019t force.\u201d \u2013 Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #195\n\u201cI think as a marginalized person you\u2019re always thinking about the deficit; you\u2019re always thinking about the scarcity. On purpose you\u2019re made to think there\u2019s not enough for everyone, so you don\u2019t ask for more. If there\u2019s not enough, you won\u2019t ask for more. If there\u2019s not enough, you won\u2019t require more. If there\u2019s not enough, you won\u2019t expect more. That\u2019s just what is stuck down your throat as a marginalized person. So it is really important for us to remind everyone that the market can never be saturated. That language in itself is exclusionary to make you not want to do this, to make you think it\u2019s not possible for you to be in a space.\u201d \u2013 Queen, Stitch Please, Episode #195\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t think of all the players in capitalism and how invested corporations are in keeping independent creators, entrepreneurs, out of this space\u2026 They want to control the market, so they will tell you the market is flooded until they\u2019re ready to play. There\u2019s a lot at work to keep individuals from playing whatever the game is.\u201d \u2013 J., Stitch Please, Episode #195\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of that trying to maintain the status quo, and that is a symptom and a function of maintaining the capitalisty, and all of these little things work to the benefit of those on top of the financial hierarchy that we have, and that is power.\u201d \u2013 J., Stitch Please, Episode #195\n\u201cI think the question to ask is \u2018who benefits?\u2019. If you count yourself out, if you take yourself out of the game before you give yourself a chance, who benefits from that? You are not benefitting, because you're not following something you\u2019re excited about. Don\u2019t count yourself out. Don\u2019t push yourself out because you\u2019re afraid.\u201d \u2013 Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #195\n\u201cWhen I started this podcast, it was just like when I created Black Women Stitch. I built what I needed. I needed to know that there were other Black women, girls, and femmes out in the world doing things with needle and thread, that I did not have to turn to these sources that were crafted by white people for the benefit of other white people but told to me like \u2018yes, you can do it too, but if it doesn\u2019t fit you, then something\u2019s wrong.\u2019 None of that is the case. There absolutely is not just a history of us in this tradition, but also us being great innovators and making things that are completely new. And to also leave something behind for those who will come next and make sure that door is propped wide open for more flourishing to continue beyond just what\u2019s happening right now. I think that anything we can do to make that more of a regular practice would be to the good. I really do.\u201d \u2013 Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #195\n\u201cNone of us are free unless all of us are free. I don\u2019t understand how we don\u2019t appreciate that. You don\u2019t get to just be a little bit racist. You don\u2019t get to be a little bit oppressive of other people because it makes you feel better or because you think you have good reason for it.

Lisa and Jennifer discuss the therapeutic aspects of sewing, setting boundaries, creating for yourself, and the importance of making time for play!"

But I can cater to myself if I sew, and that became the key thing. The feeling of making a thing that fits is unmatched.\u201d \u2013 Janet Hensell, Stitch Please, Episode #191\n\u201cIt really is this vicious circle of consumption and discarding. Buy it, wear it, throw it away. And this is another thing that sewing can reduce. It is a form of sustainability because the pieces that you end up making, you tend to hold onto them longer.\u201d \u2013 Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #191\n\u201cCrafting is self-care. Whether you\u2019re a carpenter, a seamstress, a dancer, whatever you do for your mental health and fun, it is self-care. For me that was sewing.\u201d \u2013 Janet Hensell, Stitch Please, Episode #191\n\u201cKnow what fits your lifestyle and fits your body. And when I say fit, know to fit your garments to fit you. Even if the garment is made from a cheaper fabric, once it fits you, people won\u2019t even notice.\u201d \u2013 Janet Hensell, Stitch Please, Episode #191\n\n\u00a0\nResources Mentioned:\n\nStitch Please Podcast episode: Pattern Cutting Deconstructed with Monisola Omotoso\nLondon Reign pattern and discount code: STITCHPLEASE35 valid on the London Reign dress pattern for 35% off.

After recording her cooking journey on her food blog Runaway Apricot for over 7 years, Robyn decided to expand her love of learning by taking on the art of sewing. She began her fashion design and sewing journey in 2015 to build a wardrobe of quality garments that fit her inseam and show off her bold style, and in 2019 started Styles InSeams to record her sewing journey and share information with others in the #sewingtall struggle. Robyn is an organizer of NYC Frocktails, a cocktail party for sewists, has created a 5-class learning path on sewing skills for Skillshare, and is currently preparing to launch her new clothing line for tall women in summer 2023, Robyn Bandele.\n\u00a0\nLisa Woolfork\nLisa Woolfork is an associate professor of English specializing in African American literature and culture. Her teaching and research explore Black women writers, Black identity, trauma theory, and American slavery. She is the founder of Black Women Stitch, the sewing group where Black lives matter. She is also the host/producer of Stitch Please, a weekly audio podcast that centers on Black women, girls, and femmes in sewing. In the summer of 2017, she actively resisted the white supremacist marches in her community, Charlottesville, Virginia. The city became a symbol of lethal resurging white supremacist violence. She remains active in a variety of university and community initiatives, including the Community Engaged Scholars program.

You have to work at it.\u201d \u2013 Queenora Irvin, Stitch Please\n\u201cWhen the idea came across [for Black Magic Leopard], I was like, \u2018Oh yeah, that makes total sense.\u2019... I don\u2019t always get them very quickly, but I saw this one pretty quickly and it just became a matter of how do I take the standard shapes, me understanding different hairstyles and textured hair, and how do I use particular ones to translate this overall look. I feel like it came together very fast.\u201d \u2013 Janine Lecour, Stitch Please\n\u201cIt really does feel like I\u2019m looking at a community; I\u2019m looking at a group of people who have affinity and relation with one another. The diversity\u2026 their skin colors are different, their hairstyles are different, some of the textures seem a little different from the other\u2026 the detail really pays off.\u201d \u2013 Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please\n\u201cWhen it comes to creativity and artistry and putting it out there, you really are putting a piece of yourself out there.\u201d \u2013 Queenora Irvin, Stitch Please,\n\u201cI think that there has long been a need for some equity around who gets represented on fabric, just like who gets represented anywhere.\u201d \u2013 Lisa Woolfork\n\u201cEnjoy the process. Enjoy where you are now... I think sometimes we look to where we want to be with such anticipation\u2026 just enjoy where you are, and it will make the journey so much more fulfilling.\u201d \u2013 Queenora Irvin, Stitch Please\n\nStay Connected:\nYouTube: Black Women Stitch\nInstagram: Black Women Stitch\nFacebook: Stitch Please Podcast\nLisa Woolfork\nInstagram: Lisa Woolfork\nTwitter: Lisa Woolfork\nQueenora Irvin\u00a0\nWebsite: Queenora Renee Fabrics\nInstagram: Queenora Renee\nFacebook: Queenora Renee Fabrics\nYouTube: Queenora Renee Fabrics\nPinterest: Queenora Renee\nJanine Lecour\nWebsite: Janine Lecour\nInstagram: Janine Lecour\u00a0\nSubscribe to our podcast + download each episode on Stitcher, Apple Podcasts, and Spotify.\nThis episode was produced and managed by Podcast Laundry.",

Her exhibition \u201cSay Your Piece- Black Women: Mothers, Martyrs, and Misunderstood\" is the first installation of the Say Your Piece three-part series. It has been described as \u201ca visual journey that includes a combination of symbolism and inspiration attached to the African diaspora, heightening our sense of cultural awareness.

So, I design primarily fabric and I have been doing that since 2018. I am on my third or fourth fabric collection at this point\u201d \u2014Jen Hewett in \u201cStitch Please\u201d</li><li>\u201cI have done a lot of textile art and didn\u2019t call myself a textile artist. I always say I am a printmaker first and everything flows from that, but I am owning it now, that I am a person who does and likes many things\u201d \u2014Jen Hewett in \u201cStitch Please\u201d</li><li>\u201cWith printmaking, you do one thing and you do it over and over again, unlike being a painter who does a one-of-a-kind one thing. A printmaker is already set up operationally, it makes sense to do the same thing over and over again\u201d \u2014Jen Hewett in \u201cStitch Please\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhat\u2019s the saying like \u2018walk around with the confidence of a white man and you will get what you want\u2019?\u201d \u2013Nicole Angeline\u00a0 in \u201cStitch Please\u201d</li><li>\u201cThe nice thing about the work that I do is that it is replicable. So it feels in many ways, low stakes. That I am constantly putting things out there, some will stick, some won\u2019t\u201d \u2014Jen Hewett in \u201cStitch Please\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhen I find books like this one, that are good and I like them, and I like to go back to them, because not every book you get that you are gonna go back to, but this one is nice and it's very digestible\u201d \u2014Ada Chen in \u201cStitch Please\u201d</li><li>\u201cThe overall consensus seems to be celebratory and gratitude, if I can put it in two words. Folks who are celebrating that this book exists and that women of color are having their voices centred and amplified, and talking to a variety of people. And then the gratitude which extends towards you for creating and pulling this together\u201d \u2014Lisa Woolfork in \u201cStitch Please\u201d</li><li>\u201cI wanted it to be representative. Not necessarily everybody because that\u2019s impossible, but to include people who are not included\u201d \u2014Jen Hewett in \u201cStitch Please\u201d</li><li>\u201cIn many ways, writing this book didn\u2019t feel like a race because I had this really strong sense that the community would have my back. But then I had to do everybody\u2019s story\u2019s justice in order for people to have my back\u201d\u00a0 \u2014Jen Hewett in \u201cStitch Please\u201d</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Resources Mentioned</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/asian-sewist-collective-with-ada-chen-and-nicole-angeline/id1271167671?i=1000560205060\">Asian Sewist Collective</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Stay Connected:</strong></p><p><strong>Lisa Woolfork</strong></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/blackwomenstitch/?hl=es\">Lisa Woolfork</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lwoolfork\">Lisa Woolfork</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Jen Hewett</strong></p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://jenhewett.com/\">Jen Hewett</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jenhewett/?hl=en\">Jen Hewett</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>This episode was produced and managed by<a href=\"http://www.podcastlaundry.com/\"> Podcast Laundry</a>.</p>\n",

This opened up the conversation as we talked about the exploitative nature of the fashion industry, why transparency doesn\u2019t equal sustainability, and the interlocking systems of oppression that coincide with capitalism. Aja also shares how consumers can use their collective power for positive change and why we need to start investigating our shopping habits so we can change how we participate in the system.This episode is an insightful lesson on the perils of fast fashion, the reasons why,as a society, we tie our happiness to consumerism, and how to make more sustainable and ethical choices with our clothes. So tune in and be inspired by this impactful episode. [Photo Credit for Aja's podcast cover photos: Stephen Cunningsworth]",

The \u201cThreads Across Time\u201d episode with Sarah Bond travels through time to more than a century ago and brings back a legacy of Quilt art by her enslaved ancestors. The fact that Sarah Bond still preserves those quilts portrays that they were not created just for utilitarian purposes. They were a product of love and expression.

My body confidence grew when I started sewing because I stopped limiting my wardrobe and made clothes that fit me well. I love to bring my Blackness and power in my photos of my makes. I am proud of my Blackness and being apart of the African Diaspora. In my makes and photoshoots I try my best to embody that pride because it shows the world who I am. Changing my name to reflect my ancestors roots was/is the most important thing I have ever done. When I changed my name to one that reflected who I am, and who I am to become, I felt whole. Like my pride, mindset, and personality matched with my name.\"",

This episode is all about Intentional Sewing and Intentional Living. Our special guest truly embodies this topic. If you know Kamali Obiagu from Instagram, you know that she radiates confidence in photos where she wears her impeccably stitched creations. Lisa talks with her about what it took to get to that place - discovering a sewing community (and PDF patterns!) and learning to love the body she\u2019s in today.

So, everyday I get to be a Therapist is a day that is both meaningful, and heavy to me. Sewing, on the other hand provides me with the freedom to be myself. It gives me a space to make mistakes and say exactly what I have to say, in the way I want to say it without consequence. That experience is so meaningful to my emotional and mental health. I have been a Marriage and Family Therapist, in private practice for 10 years By far, branching out on my own to become an entrepreneur of a sustainable business has been an awe inspiring event for me. Over the years, I/my business has been featured in publications like Parenting Magazine, Heart and Soul magazine, Counseling Today magazine, but my greatest accomplishment is the work that happens behind closed doors, with my people. I have only been sewing for 5 years but my sewing journey has provided me with so many opportunities to learn who I really am through the process of building my own self-esteem. I never would have imagined that 5 years ago, when my client gifted me an old sewing machine of hers, that I would become a Janome maker, be featured in Sewn magazine, have an opportunity to speak on a sewing related podcast or even become a coalition member of Black Makers Matter. I have learned that my perspective matters and I don't want to squander the opportunity to positively affect people, either through sewing or through my therapeutic intervention. To me, there is nothing more meaningful than that!\"</p><p>Her upcoming project is the relaunch of Relationship Rocket Science: I am so excited to be relaunching my Relationship Rocket Science brand which is geared toward teaching people how to create the lives they want through their relationships. I am an educator at heart, so it is very important to me that my people walk away from me with tools and skills that will allow them to execute what they have learned successfully. For this reason, I will soon be releasing a series of workbooks that will address healing oneself, communication skill building and, dating and marriage tools for success. I realize that I cannot be everyone's therapist, so I'm using Relationship Rocket Science to touch as many people as I can in a variety of ways. I love to answer people's questions about love and all kinds of relationships, so My Relationship Rocket Science advice column podcast is in the planning stages and will be up and running soon. I'm so excited about all of it!</p>\n",

Garment sewing and writing stories about it on my blog had become my main self-care practice because it was freeing me from an adulthood of ill-fitting ready-to-wear (I am short and curvy) and fully engaged my brain and hands in something meant just for me. When I stopped keeping and making sewing promises to myself, I was determined to find out why and began a quiet journey of self-examination. I re-read the book by bell hooks that saved me in college, Sisters of the Yam: Black Women & Self-Recovery and began some much needed inner work and healing. The process is on-going. When the pandemic hit, I was triggered back into SBM mode. This time I recognized it! Those lost sewjo feelings were my call to action. I reached out to the sewing community, found out I wasn't alone and started writing, plugging holes in my self-care, and therapy-sewing my way out of the shadows. I called it my Sewjo Reclamation Project and immediately created my first sewing social media meme with an image from the movie, How Stella Got Her Groove Back. From there, I decided to self-publish my first writings as a for-profit ebook instead of on my blog. This is a transition for my platform that aligned with my 2019 transition to independent consulting from 20 years in the tech industry.

To bring awareness to my Sewjo Reclamation Project, I have also begun live-streaming answers to questions from the sewing community about sewjo reclamation to my Instagram followers.

And even her college student has reclaimed The Podcast Studio (formerly known as \"his bedroom\")! These inconveniences pale in comparison to the life-or-death situations faced regularly by the nation's health care workers in this pandemic.  Lisa talks about making what health care providers call PPE, personal protective equipment. Calls for sewists to make masks are increasing. Patterns, sew-a-longs, tutorials, online classes--some paid, others for free--are on the rise. Lisa explores the construction, benefits, liability, and ethical issues in the push for homemade masks. The episode includes commentary from a nurse currently providing care in the context of COVID9.
