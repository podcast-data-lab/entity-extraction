                "summary": "This week\u2019s guest is Safi Rauf, an Afghan refugee who came to the U.S. as a teen and is now the president and founder of Human First Coalition. Also a veteran, he tells us about his work in Afghanistan helping to evacuate local interpreters who worked with American troops. He shares the astonishing story of how he was taken hostage\u2014and eventually released\u2014by the Taliban while working there. He also talks about the Afghan Adjustment Act and the obstacles he\u2019s run into while advocating for it. Plus, writers Rob Christensen and Tocarra Mallard stop by for a little schadenfreude about Trump\u2019s very bad midterms week.\n\nUpdate: Since the recording of this podcast, allegations of fraud and mistreatment have surfaced against Safi Rauf and his organization Human First Coalition. We are watching closely and will keep our audience posted on any developments related to these claims.\n\nStream our newest episode, \u201cElection Wrap-Up Special,\u201d now on Apple TV+.\n\n\n\n\nCredits:\n\nHosted by: Jon Stewart\n\n\n\n\nFeaturing, in order of appearance: Tocarra Mallard, Rob Christensen, Safi Rauf\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Produced by Jon Stewart, Brinda Adhikari, James Dixon, Chris McShane, and Richard Plepler.\n\nLead Producer: Sophie Erickson\n\nProducers: Zach Goldbaum, Caity Gray\n\nAssoc.
