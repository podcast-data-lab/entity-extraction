It inspires an incredible range of answers and a variety of interpretations. It\u2019s because that word\u2014\"Freedom\"\u2014means so many different things to different people.\r\r\n\r\r\nSo many of the answers I\u2019ve heard about freedom have had to do with daring, going beyond a threshold, but there\u2019s always a secondary experience of safety.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn this workshop, we\u2019ll explore how we can find small moments of freedom in the face of the things that shake our sense of safety and security. We\u2019ll come together to share how we experience the feeling of freedom and inspire each other to take care of ourselves.\r\r\n\r\r\nI\u2019ll be discussing this month\u2019s newsletter on the feeling of freedom.\r\r\n\r\r\nLetters from Esther Perel is a monthly newsletter and free workshop series created to help you deepen your connections through reflection and action.

It is not a chance to do all the things we've been neglecting but an opportunity to just be, to release the need to produce and optimize, and instead allowing life to happen around us. By relinquishing agency, we can truly relax and restore our bodies.\r\n\r\nThis month, we will be skipping our virtual workshop to rest and prepare for the month to come as we plan to focus on healing and recovery in the fall.

David Ley discusses how men have few role models for expressing healthy sexuality. Men today are struggling to navigate the complex social landscape of sexuality, and often, their only role models are males whose sexual behaviors have resulted in public scandals or accusations. Based on decades of work with men struggling with their sexuality, Dr. Ley explores ways in which he has assisted them in understanding, accepting and expressing their erotic interests as gentlemen.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSessions Live is an annual event hosted by Esther Perel for therapists and coaches.

On a global level, the stakes seem impossibly high. But how about in your bedroom, or living room? Can we as therapists, coaches, relieve men's suffering - both individual symptoms and interpersonal difficulties - by helping them reconstruct who they are as men, what kind of man to be?

Shame may obstruct the formations of an integrated erotic identity development. Shame does not extinguish sexual and erotic desire.  Psychotherapy cannot perform erotic-ectomies.  Shame avoidance becomes a masculine strategy for living with an erotic conflict.  \r\nHow do men explore their erotic orientation without slipping into judgments and narratives that enforce masculinity upon the erotic?\r\nIs erotic literacy a masculinity transgression?\r\nIs a sexual behavior disease/label the solution for men to find empathy for their erotic diversity that transgresses masculine scripts?\r\n\r\nErlanger Turner\r\nAddressing Masculinities and Cultural Expectations in Therapy\r\n\r\nDr. Turner will discuss masculinity norms and how they pose challenges for engaging men in therapy.
