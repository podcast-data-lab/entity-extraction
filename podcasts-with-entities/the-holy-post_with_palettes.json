First, a new documentary about reality TV\u2019s Dugger family is exposing the ugly side of the Christian fundamentalism, patriarchy, and legalism taught by Bill Gothard\u2019s ministry. And, Christian broadcaster and pillar of the Religious Right, Pat Robertson, died this week at 93. Was there a link between the popularity of Gothard and Robertson for a whole generation of American Christians? Then, New Testament scholar Nijay Gupta talks about his new book \u201cTell Her Story: How Women Led, Taught, and Ministered in the Early Church.\u201d And he participates in an unexpected therapy session with Skye about their shared background.

In Part 1 of an interview about this new book, historian Daniel G. Hummel explains to Phil how this rapture theology isn\u2019t rooted in church history, but was invented by a British layman less than 200 years ago. And why it was embraced by American pastors during the Civil War who wanted to avoid talking about slavery, race, and reconstruction. Also this week\u2014paganism is on the rise. Who is really killing public schools?

There will be a tribulation period with the rise of the Antichrist, mark of the beast, war, famine, earthquakes, etc. before Christ eventually comes and rules on earth for 1,000 years during which peace will reign. After one final rebellion, God will crush evil forever, offer a final judgment, and establish heaven and hell for eternity.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <ul> <li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Postmillennialism - The millennium will come from the spiritual and moral influence of the Church through preaching and teaching.

The so-called \u201cindependent prophets'' are predicting God will kill Donald Trump\u2019s opponents next month. Why are they still supporting him when there are alternatives?

Jonathan Haidt says three untruths that fuel depression were embraced by progressives ten years ago, but now they\u2019re commonplace among conservatives too. Then, in 1976, Jimmy Carter represented a biblically-rooted evangelicalism that was also politically progressive. So, why did white evangelicals abandon him\u2014or did they? And former Facebook executive, Nona Jones, explains why social media companies say their mission is to create community but their business models do the opposite.

Then, new data finds liberal teens are struggling with depression at higher rates on average than conservative teens. What\u2019s the explanation?

And social psychologist Jonathan Haidt says the evidence is abundant that social media is the cause, but the tech industry is resisting any changes. Phil, Kaitlyn, and Skye discuss the social, political, and spiritual dimensions of the crisis. They also revisit the Asbury revival and how previous revivals in America produced both good and bad fruit. New Testament professor, Scot McKnight, talks about his latest book, \u201cRevelation for the Rest of Us.\u201d He argues that a literal reading of the book isn\u2019t just wrong but dangerous.

One side says the ads did not present the gospel. The other says the campaign\u2019s funders are bigots. And everyone is wondering if the $20 million could have been spent more effectively. Phil, Skye, and Kaitlyn offer their takes. Then, Tim Keller has a new article with his prescription for how Christianity can thrive again in America, but does it all come down to overcoming political idolatry? And a new report from PRRI looks at the sobering data about Christian Nationalism. One-third of Americans are either committed Christian Nationalists or very sympathetic to it, and the majority of them are white evangelicals. Historian Kristin Kobes Du Mez is back to discuss the data and explain the link between Christian Nationalism, patriarchy, and authoritarianism.

Drawing from the words of Jesus, the Apostles, and the early church, Shane Claiborne says most American Christians have gotten it wrong. His new book, \u201cRethinking Life: Embracing the Sacredness of Every Person,\u201d argues for the value of the unborn, but also for combating poverty, racism, and other dehumanizing evils.

Esau McCaulley\u2019s editorial explains how King\u2019s current popularity comes from the tendency to cherry pick a few MLK quotes about race, but conveniently overlook his more controversial sermons about poverty, justice, and reparations. What does it mean to take King\u2019s words seriously today?

We also saw a flood of vaccine conspiracy theories hit social media. Phil asks, why are conservative Christians so distrustful of experts and enamored with fringe conspiracies? Then, David French has joined The New York Times. Progressives are upset about his Christian views, and conservatives are accusing him of selling out for acceptance among liberal elites. This launches the hosts into a broader discussion about the difference between principled pluralism and cultural accommodation. And Christian theologians universally agree that the God revealed in the Bible is neither male nor female, but Jesus was a man and he taught us to pray to \u201cOur Father.\u201d How do we reconcile these facts?

They also debate what responsibility social media companies do have for the speech they allow on their platforms, as well as court cases in Texas and Florida that could dramatically change how social media functions for all Americans.\n 0:00 - Intro\n 2:15 - Free speech and social media\n 53:24 - Free speech and journalism\n 1:05:10 - Credits\n \"Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson Don't Understand the First Amendment\" by David French (The Atlantic) - https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/elon-musk-and-tucker-carlson-dont-understand-the-first-amendment/672352/\n \u00a0\n \"The 'Twitter Files' Show It's Time to Reimagine Free Speech Online\" by David French (The Dispatch)\n https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/frenchpress/the-twitter-files-show-its-time-to-reimagine-free-speech-online/\n David French:\u00a0https://twitter.com/DavidAFrench\n Holy Post website:\u00a0https://www.holypost.com/\n Holy Post Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/holypost",

            "contentSnippet": "A Texas megachurch is facing criticism after a viral TikTok video showed a rehearsal of its Christmas production with drummers flying over the crowd on wires. The church says it\u2019s simply offering its best to celebrate the birth of Jesus. Critics say it\u2019s an extravagant violation of Jesus\u2019 humble spirit. Who\u2019s right? New data says Americans are far more isolated and lonely than ever before, and it\u2019s not because of Covid. Is the church the solution or part of the problem? And a researcher offers three surprising explanations for why the decline of religion in the U.S. didn\u2019t start until the 1990s. Then, Old Testament scholar Carmen Imes answers questions about the book of Exodus. Why did God harden Pharaoh\u2019s heart? What does it really mean to take God\u2019s name in vain?

The Holy Post crew asks if the political side of the pro-life movement has hit a wall, and if the Republican Party is really moving on from Donald Trump. Then, new data shows a sharp rise among evangelicals who didn\u2019t attend college and who don\u2019t attend church identifying as Republicans. What does it mean? And a new book chronicles the rise of Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens, and the rage-fueled conservative youth culture. Then, Skye talks to Christianity Today\u2019s Morgan Lee about what global Christian leaders think about guns and self-defense.

But does Jesus really have a PR problem, or does the church have a discipleship problem? Then, culture war issues are fracturing evangelical colleges into 5 distinct groups. What does it mean for the future of the church?</p> <p>Phil talks to pastor and podcaster Mike Erre about how to think biblically about the culture wars. Does the New Testament call the church to have power over the culture, how did Jesus influence others, and what about the presence of real evil in the world?

            "content": "<p>In a recent article, Russell Moore lamented the captivity of evangelicals to conspiracy theories and political radicalization, but he argued \u201cthe problem is not in the pulpit\u201d and \u201cthe problem isn\u2019t primarily in the pews either.\u201d Instead, he believes the radicalization is happening outside the church. David French and Skye Jethani agree that radicalization is happing outside the church, but say there is also a real problem in the pews. What role do churches and pastors have in de-radicalizing evangelicals, and what\u2019s preventing them from speaking up and doing more?

Today's episode navigates this tension. First, a recent article by Helen Lewis says non-believers still have religious impulses that are now being expressed through political activism. Is Christian faith being replaced by Wokism on the left and Nationalism on the right? Then, David French asks why our politics are so toxic and hateful if both parties are still dependent on devoutly Christian voters. What will it take for believers on both sides to put Christian virtue ahead of just winning elections? And Kaitlyn Schiess talks to Lore Ferguson Wilbert about her new book, \u201cA Curious Faith: The Questions God Asks, We Ask, and We Wish Someone Would Ask Us.\u201d She says too many Christian communities discourage curiosity while the Bible is \u201ca permission slip to ask questions.\u201d Plus, scientists are growing animals in artificial wombs without eggs or sperm.

And Marvin Olasky, the former editor of World Magazine, writes about the dramatic change he witnessed among evangelicals over his long career. Drawing from thousands of letters he received, Olasky concludes, \u201cThe Republican party platform has become more important than the gospel for many who identify as evangelicals.\u201d Special guest co-host Drew Dyck joins Phil and Skye to discuss the articles. Then, president of Barna research, David Kinnaman, is back with more stats to unpack. With a record number of pastors thinking seriously about quitting, and political polarization listed among the top reasons, Kinnaman says the church is facing a crisis of discipleship.

Their new app and podcast series is designed to help us see the Bible as brilliant literature, and not just a depository of quick answers to life\u2019s problems.

With guns now the leading cause of death for kids and teens in America, Skye says it\u2019s time for Christians to explore all possible solutions, including amending the Constitution, similar to the pro-life movement\u2019s approach to ending abortion.

The podcast crew discuss their own experiences with Peretti\u2019s books and how they\u2019ve shaped today\u2019s culture war\u2014including a congresswoman\u2019s recent statement that Catholics helping immigrants is proof the church is run by Satan.

The Holy Post crew unpacks the reactions and asks what separates godly and ungodly patriotism.

Those opposed to #MeToo and Black Lives Matter responded by labeling empathy a sin. Voices advocating for women and people of color within the SBC left the denomination.

But is the problem really that evangelicals are less moral, or that they\u2019re more easily deceived? Then, Matthew Soerens from World Relief talks about the unfolding tragedy in Afghanistan.

Then, Skye talks to Baylor University history professor Beth Allison Barr about her new book, \u201cThe Making of Biblical Womanhood: How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth.\u201d Barr explains why Paul\u2019s writings about women are widely misread, how women have led throughout church history, and how the Reformation created the domesticated vision of womanhood still idealized by the church today.

Not according to New Testament scholar, Dr. Timothy Gombis. Because we\u2019re not ancient Near Eastern people living in a desert, he says it\u2019s not possible to literally apply the Bible. Instead, any faithful Christian needs to learn how to improvise. Dr. Gombis talks with Skye about faithful improvisation, what cross-shaped cultural engagement looks like, and how idolatry destroys bodies.

What about America\u2019s gun culture or mental illness? Phil, Skye, and Christian discuss the many facets of the tragedy and get vulnerable about their own history with evangelicalism\u2019s obsession with sex.

And if we can\u2019t reduce the number of guns, what\u2019s the best way to limit gun crime and mass shootings?\n \u00a0\n Also this week, the Holy Post crew is joined by Kaitlyn Schiess to discuss the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and what her death means for the presidential election and the future of the Supreme Court. Are the Republicans being hypocrites for filling Ginsburg\u2019s seat weeks before the election when they refused to let Obama nominate a justice 8 months before the election in 2016? And what should we think of the Democrat\u2019s threat to pack the court? Skye warns about dismantling political norms, Kaitlyn says Christians viewing every election as an existential threat is a failure of discipleship, and Phil plays the devil\u2019s advocate by throwing down the abortion card.\n  https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/yes-america-could-split-apart",
