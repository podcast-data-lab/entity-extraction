What if we\u2019ve been running to sources of stress instead of God\u2019s source of rest?</p>\r\n<p>Being weary doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re weak. Maybe it just means we\u2019ve been \u201cfilling up\u201d in the wrong places. Maybe we\u2019re tired because we\u2019ve been pushing against what God is trying to call us into.</p>\r\n<p>He said, \u201cCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest\u201d (Matthew 11:28).&nbsp;Are you ready for true rest?</p>\r\n"

You\u2019re going to learn the power and significance of the phrase, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t focus on your frustrations, your fears or even the facts, in this season, we need to \u201cFocus On The Fruit.\u201d To support this ministry and help us continue to reach people all around the world click here: http://ele.vc/TI55jR\r\n"
