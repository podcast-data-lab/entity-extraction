    "description": "Named by Apple as the Best Show of the Year 2021, Host Dr. Maya Shankar blends compassionate storytelling with the science of human behavior to help us understand who we are, and who we become, in the face of a big change.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019ll hear extraordinary stories of change from celebrities like Tiffany Haddish, Kacey Musgraves, and Riz Ahmed, as well as real-life inspirations like Christine Ha, who became permanently blind in her early twenties and went on to win the reality TV show Master Chef; Richard Harris, the Australian doctor who rescued a boys\u2019 soccer team trapped deep inside of a cave in Thailand; and Euna Lee, the Korean-American journalist who was held captive in North Korea for 140 days. The show also features science experts, like Adam Grant, Angela Duckworth, and Katy Milkman, who share strategies for how we can live happier and more fulfilling lives.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou can follow the show @DrMayaShankar on Instagram.",
