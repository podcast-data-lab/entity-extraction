Alex graduated from George Washington University with a doctorate in Clinical Psychology. During this time, he focused his research efforts on psychometrics and was a research fellow for the National Institutes of Health. He created a questionnaire to assess how your health beliefs affect how you utilize medical services. It was well-received and set him up for an academic career.\n\nUpon graduating, his research interests evolved to investments, and he sought a formal career in the financial industry. He joined McLean Asset Management and was able to publish a number of articles. He also founded a financial planning software company to better serve the industry and our underlying clients. He quickly became disillusioned by the lack of assessment tools used in our profession that can help individuals determine their best path for retirement success. He took Wade\u2019s framework for Retirement Income Planning and sought to quantify these concepts into a workable retirement income model. \n\nWade is a one-man think tank. Wade\u2019s retirement income framework was the base that helped Alex build out the RISA\u00ae. He is the Professor of Retirement Income at The American College of Financial Services, a higher education institution for financial planners. He leads the curriculum for their Retirement Income Certified Professional designation (RICP\u00ae). He is also a partner with Alex at McLean Asset Management and Retirement Researcher. Wade earned a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 2003 and became a CFA charter holder in 2011. Wade regularly publishes his research on retirement income topics in leading peer-reviewed practitioner-based financial planning research journals.",
                "summary": "This week on Standard Deviations with Dr. Daniel Crosby, Dr. Crosby is joined by Drs. Alex Murguia and Wade Pfau of RISA. Alex graduated from George Washington University with a doctorate in Clinical Psychology. During this time, he focused his research efforts on psychometrics and was a research fellow for the National Institutes of Health. He created a questionnaire to assess how your health beliefs affect how you utilize medical services. It was well-received and set him up for an academic career.\n\nUpon graduating, his research interests evolved to investments, and he sought a formal career in the financial industry. He joined McLean Asset Management and was able to publish a number of articles. He also founded a financial planning software company to better serve the industry and our underlying clients. He quickly became disillusioned by the lack of assessment tools used in our profession that can help individuals determine their best path for retirement success. He took Wade\u2019s framework for Retirement Income Planning and sought to quantify these concepts into a workable retirement income model. \n\nWade is a one-man think tank. Wade\u2019s retirement income framework was the base that helped Alex build out the RISA\u00ae. He is the Professor of Retirement Income at The American College of Financial Services, a higher education institution for financial planners. He leads the curriculum for their Retirement Income Certified Professional designation (RICP\u00ae). He is also a partner with Alex at McLean Asset Management and Retirement Researcher. Wade earned a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 2003 and became a CFA charter holder in 2011. Wade regularly publishes his research on retirement income topics in leading peer-reviewed practitioner-based financial planning research journals."

Is this due to not having enough resources, not being engaged with a community or some mix of the two?\n- Is it a better approach to work really hard and retire earlier or to give yourself the space and time to explore hobbies alongside work and work later into life?\n- What are the upsides and downsides of \u201cFIRE\u201d (Financial Independence, Retire Early)?\n- Social security is the biggest pillar upon which the average person\u2019s retirement plan rests, but we know that social security faces many problems if something isn\u2019t done quickly to fix them. Should we assume that social security might not exist in planning for retirement or how should we think about the longevity of social security?\n- What actions can we take to increase retirement savings? If money is tight in retirement, what options does one have?\n- How do we move the needle on the social security problem when no one seems to have the political will to pose a difficult solution?\nWeb: www.jamiehopkins.com\nCompliance Code: 1589-OAS-5/10/2021",

In theory, decisions made under conditions of certainty involve ranking the known alternatives and choosing the most preferred option, simple enough.</p>\n<p>Uncertain decisions operate from a similar theory, with the only kink being that subjective probabilities are assigned to the different outcome likelihoods. Thus, decision makers weigh the desirability of a given option by the chance that it will or won\u2019t occur. These are nice ideas and make a certain amount of sense until you consider the sheer volume of decisions we make each day.</p>\n<p>When you consider that you make 12,775,000 decisions each year, thinking that each determination is made by weighing its probabilistic utility starts to strain credulity.

Each year, a Gallup poll asks Americans to determine \u201cWhat is the smallest amount of money a family of four needs to get along in this community?\u201d Gallup finds that the answers to this question moves up in line with average incomes of the respondents. \u201cEnough\u201d, it seems, is a moving target that our flawed neurology won\u2019t quite let us scratch.

Indeed, the Western tendency toward outward displays of wealth and comparative measurement is not endemic to all developed countries.

The Swiss approach demonstrates that our views are an outcropping of a specific way of viewing wealth rather than something deterministic about human nature. We are not our worst impulses and it is up to us to determine to support each other on the way to balance and true happiness rather than prodding each other toward jealousy and excess.</p>\n<p>\u201cDaniel Kahneman helmed a Princeton study set out to answer the age-old question, \u201cCan money buy happiness?\u201d Their answer? Sort of. Researchers found that making little money did not cause sadness in and of itself but it did tend to heighten and exacerbate existing worries. For instance, among people who were divorced, 51% of those who made less than $1,000/month reported having felt sad or stressed the previous day, whereas that number fell to 24% among those earning more than $3,000/month. Having more money seems to provide those undergoing adversity with greater security and resources for dealing with their troubles. However, the researchers found that this effect (mitigating the impact of difficulty) disappears altogether at $75,000.</p>\n<p>For those making more than $75,000 individual differences have much more to do with happiness than does money. While the study does not make any specific inferences as to why $75,000 is the magic number, I\u2019d like to take a stab at it. For most families making $75,000/year, they have enough to live in a safe home, attend quality schools and have appropriate leisure time. Once these basic needs are met, quality of life has less to do with buying happiness and more to do with individual attitudes. After all, someone who makes $750,000 can buy a faster car than someone who makes $75,000, but their ability to get from point A to point B is not substantially improved. It would seem that once we have our basic financial needs met, the rest is up to us.\u201d</p>\n",
