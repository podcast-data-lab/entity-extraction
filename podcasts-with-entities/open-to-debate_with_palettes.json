                "summary": "According to an October 2022 Pew survey, \u201c88% of US adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use.\u201d While marijuana legalization is gaining more and more cultural acceptance, effectively regulating drugs has long flummoxed policy and lawmakers. Some are even starting to have second thoughts, especially when it comes to how to practically enforce legal sales. In fact, voters in Oklahoma \u2013 one of the nation\u2019s leading weed markets \u2013overwhelmingly rejected recreational legalization earlier this year, even though voters backed medical marijuana legalization by a double-digit margin in 2018. Those who argue \u201cYes\u201d for marijuana legalization say legalization creates more problems for our legal system because it requires extra enforcement to crack down on already robust illegal markets to make way for new, regulated, and legal markets. Additionally, competition from illegal weed markets is undercutting legal sales, which means the expected revenue stream from a legalized industry is far lower than expected. Those who argue \u201cNo\u201d say legalization can reduce the burden on law enforcement and criminal justice systems, allowing resources to be redirected to more pressing issues. They also highlight marijuana\u2019s medical benefits, such as for pain management and treatment of certain health conditions, which have made a difference in people\u2019s lives.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith this context, it\u2019s time to debate \u2014 and reconsider \u2014 \u201cIs Legalizing Marijuana A Mistake?\u201d\u00a0\n\nArguing Yes:\u00a0Paul J.

Fast forward to 2023 and the global banking system may be facing its most\u00a0significant crisis since 2008. Within a short span, a run on deposits at Silicon Valley\u00a0Bank quickly led to the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history, with Switzerland's Credit\u00a0Suisse later seeking government lifelines. A second US regional bank \u2014 Signature\u00a0Bank \u2014 failed, and a third \u2014 First Republic Bank \u2014 was propped up. To some, these\u00a0are signs of the kinds of broader risks the global economy stared down in 2008. A\u00a0combination of factors, including an eroding of regulations, sharp interest rate rises,\u00a0mismanagement at banks, coupled with the overarching uncertainty of volatile crypto\u00a0landscape, have raised new questions about the scale of turmoil that could confront\u00a0markets. This cocktail of risks, some argue, has added such dangers to banking\u00a0systems that it is no longer safer than it was in 2008. Others disagree. As bad this\u00a0recent crisis appears to be, they say, regulatory reforms and liquidity requirements have\u00a0made significant strides since the days of 2008. The system also effectively contained\u00a0the contagion, something that required far greater government intervention in 2008.

            "content": "This year, the Federal Trade Commission decided shake up the labor market, proposing to ban non-compete clauses for the tens of millions of workers they affect. The clauses are essentially contracts between employers and employees that prohibit the former from competing with the business after the employment has ended. As many as 30% of all U.S. private sector workers have signed such agreements, which actually find their roots all the way back in 15th century England. Those who defend such clauses say employers need these contracts to protect their investments in training workers, not to mention safeguarding their trade secrets.

                "summary": "This was supposed to be the \u201cChinese century.\u201d In just a few decades, China transitioned from a developing economy to the world\u2019s second largest. Measured in purchasing power parity, it actually surpassed the U.S. economy in 2014, and has since expanded its military, monetary, infrastructure, and soft power capacities in ways that all seemed to point to long-term advantages as a rising power. At the Communist Party\u2019s five-yearly congress in October 2022, Xi Jinping cemented his place as the country\u2019s \u201chelmsman\u201d and its most powerful person since Mao Zedong, with an unprecedented third term as party chief. And yet the failure of China\u2019s zero-COVID policy, a slumping economy, apparent supply chain vulnerabilities within its technology sector, and a problematic demographic profile have all raised questions about the scope of China\u2019s future power. Those who say it has peaked say the Chinese system is facing significant economic headwinds, uneven innovation, a heavy debt burden, as well as mounting frustrations among its younger populations with regard to upward mobility and censorship. Those who say it hasn\u2019t peaked argue that while the nation\u2019s economic growth has indeed slowed, massive Chinese spending in infrastructure, defense, and technology will nonetheless allow it to enlarge its global power projections well into the future. Against this backdrop, we debate this question:\u00a0Has China\u2019s Power Peaked?\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArguing \u201cYes\u201d\u00a0is Michael Beckley, formerly of the Harvard Kennedy School, the US Department of Defense, the RAND Corporation, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is the author of \u201cUnrivaled: Why America Will Remain the World\u2019s Sole Superpower,\u201d has a PhD in political science from Columbia University, and is currently associate professor of political science at Tufts University.\u00a0\u00a0\nArguing \u201cNo\u201d\u00a0is Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, a leading global political risk research and consulting firm. He is also a founder of the digital media firm GZERO Media. Bremmer is the foreign affairs columnist and editor-at-large at Time magazine, where he writes about China, U.S. foreign policy, and geopolitics. He has published ten books, including \u201cSuperpower,\u201d \u201cThe Power of Crisis,\u201d and the national bestsellers \u201cThe End of the Free Market\u201d and \u201cEvery Nation for Itself.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Under his guidance, a slew of firings, a resurgence of unsavory Tweeters, and a bevy of on-again, off-again bans, have all raised questions about the platform\u2019s long-term viability. Some investors have labeled Musk an albatross around Twitter\u2019s neck, calling for him to stay focused on Tesla and SpaceX.

                "summary": "Processed food is bad for you, right? Well, there\u2019s more to this story. As new technologies create foods that can\u2019t be made in home kitchens, such as plant-based meats and dairy products made with plant proteins, the question of whether we should all be consuming more highly processed foods is up for debate. Advocates say a substantial increase in food processing is the best way to feed growing human populations while also reducing food waste. We should trust \u2013 and invest \u2013 in food technology that can make our global food supply healthier and more sustainable, including highly or ultra-processed foods. Opponents argue that these kinds of foods are often less nutritious, and are commonly linked to adverse health indices, particularly when it comes to ultra-processing.\u00a0As this debate blooms, Intelligence Squared partners with the Institute of Food Technologists to debate this question: Should We Eat More Processed Foods?\u00a0\u00a0\nArguing in favor of the motion is\u00a0Amy Webb and\u00a0Michael Gibney.\u00a0Arguing against the motion is\u00a0Kevin Hall and Marion Nestle.\u00a0Emmy award-winning journalist\u00a0John Donvan\u00a0moderates.\u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "Unions may be on the verge of a resurgence. After decades of decline, workers are organizing at well-known companies, like Starbucks, Amazon, and Google, at a pace not seen since the 1930s. Decades of stagnant wages, recent labor shortages, and the most vocally pro-union President in recent memory have all stoked key wins for American labor, including successful strikes at John Deere and Kellogg. In fact, recent polling shows public support for labor unions has climbed to 71%, its highest level since 1965. During the old industrial days, unions had broad influence over the American economy. But their power waned. In 1983, one in 5 employees belonged to a union. Last year, that number had dwindled to one in 10, with most of the declines occurring in the private sector. Some say good riddance. They argue that unions actually hurt workers and the economy under the guise of supporting both. Union dues sap salaries, they say, and can actually increase unemployment. They also make the economy more rigid to change, raise consumer prices, and ultimately render unionized companies less competitive. Advocates, however, argue that in light of yawning income inequality, organized labor is desperately needed. Unions increase workers\u2019 pay and benefits, they say, and can also settle disputes more equitably, improve wages, and encourage a more robust middle class. Of course, not all unions are created equal. And the difference between private and public-sector unions needs to be explored. Yet as public support for organized labor has grown as more workers push to join unions, an overarching question looms large: Do Unions Work For The Economy?\u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Those who say \u201cyes\u201d cite safety concerns \u2013 particularly when dealing with vulnerable populations \u2013 and call it a necessary step to return to normal. Those who say \u201cno\u201d argue these sorts of mandates violate individual rights, could expose recipients to potential dangers from the vaccines themselves, and set dangerous broader precedents when it comes to government overreach in public health. It is an especially timely question that pits health concerns up against ideals of personal liberty. And it has practical implications as societies emerge from lockdown. Having it out in the public square, Intelligence Squared host John Donvan presides over a spirited debate between Michael J. Anderson, a Wisconsin attorney who has represented employees resisting vaccine mandates, and Lawrence Gostin, a professor of law at Georgetown University, which is enforcing a vaccine mandate.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

As the nation gears up for another contentious presidential election, some are calling for an end to the Electoral College. They argue that the college subverts the will of the American people by unfairly prioritizing rural and swing states over the nation\u2019s majority. But others say the Electoral College, which the Founders established in the Constitution, is necessary to ensure voters in less populous states have a voice in picking our president. Has the Electoral College outlived its usefulness?\nThis debate is presented in partnership with the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law as part of the Newt and Jo\u00a0Minow\u00a0Debate Series.\u00a0\u00a0\nMotion: The Electoral College Has Outlived Its Usefulness\n\n\ufeffFor the Motion:\nJamelle Bouie - Columnist, New York Times\nKate Shaw - Law Professor & Supreme Court Contributor, ABC News\n\nAgainst the Motion:\nTara Ross - Author, \"Why We Need the Electoral College\"\nBradley A.

The cryptocurrency promises to revolutionize global finance by placing control of currency in the hands of users, not nations, and make financial exchanges more transparent, efficient, and democratic. And it seems to be taking hold: Earlier this year both the Cboe and CME debuted Bitcoin futures. But is Bitcoin really a safe bet? Proponents say the hype around the cryptocurrency is warranted, and previous critics \u2013 including executives at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs \u2013 are increasingly jumping on the Bitcoin (block)train. On the other hand, skeptics suggest this highly volatile digital currency offers a platform for illicit activity, including money laundering and trafficking of humans and drugs, free from government oversight and regulation. And, they argue, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value \u2013 the price is based on market enthusiasm rather than actual utility. This debate is presented in partnership with the Adam Smith Society. The Adam Smith Society \u2014 a project of the Manhattan Institute \u2014 is an expansive, chapter-based network of MBA students, professionals, and business leaders who work to foster debate about the moral, social, and economic benefits of capitalism.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

One side may argue that these preferences level the playing field, remedy prior discrimination, and enhance diversity within the classroom, thus redeeming the true promise of equal protection.

This proposition, they say, is exactly why the First Amendment protects the freedom of speech and of the press. On this view, restrictions on independent political speech undermine and subvert our constitutional structure.\u00a0But others take a different view: If everyone can spend as much money as they like to express their political views, then some voices will be amplified, magnified and enhanced \u2014 while others will be all but drowned out. On this view, it is this inequality of influence that subverts our constitutional structure \u2014 and restrictions that level the playing field actually enhance rather than abridge the freedom of speech.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
