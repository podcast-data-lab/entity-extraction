In front of a live audience of lucky patrons, Rachel and Saeed discuss grief and anxiety, letting our loved ones be whole people, playing tricks on readers with form, the differences between writing poetry and nonfiction, and how to have a career and make a living as a writer as well as Saeed\u2019s books Prelude to Bruise, How We Fight For Our Lives, and Alive at the End of the World.

From their home studio, she and Rachel discuss the experience of losing her income from live performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, creativity, ambition, hoop-jumping, ensemble work, the joy of learning new instruments and forms, the value of classical music studies at a young age even for those who won\u2019t become professional musicians, and how both of them, in different ways and under different circumstances, came into their own as artists while mothering young children.

In Rachel\u2019s home, the friends discussed Doreen\u2019s time with Commonplace and her new podcast, \u4e00\u5e74\u7684\u544a\u767d/ Dos Salidas, created with her mother Mish Liang Hsu. Dos Salidas, produced and distributed by Ghost Island Media, is Taiwan\u2019s first limited-series audio documentary and was nominated for Best New Show in the 2022 KKBOX Podcast Awards.\n\nThis conversation touches on creative friendships, how people\u2019s lives intersect across time, the importance of editing lightly, the need to control our narratives, how to ask burning questions, intimacy, mothers and children, lingering traumas of COVID-19 in Taiwan and the United States, and the relationship between anxiety and confession."

Makenna speaks about living close to the land and still being ensnared in the world of capital; the slippage between autofiction, fiction, memoir and nonfiction; how she loves artists who play with the real; and what it might mean to write without assuming dominance over reality,  Rachel and Makenna discuss their mothers, motherhood as a metaphor or lens, the impossibility of living an ethical life and opting out of being an oppressor within capitalism, the shame of realizing progressive utopianism might be just another form of \u201cprivate contentment,\u201d Psyche and Eros, the social construction of vigor, the stories we tell about about ourselves, Agnes Varda and her idea that happiness is joy and pain side by side, why Makenna loves reading short novels by women translated into English from other languages and so much more.

NourbeSe Philip the day after Philip received the 2020 PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature in New York. Rachel begins by asking M. NourbeSe about a line in her acceptance speech: \u201cBeing must be sufficient and not contingent.\u201d They talk about \u201cSawubona,\u201d a greeting used by Zulu and other African cultures, meaning \u201cI see you,\u201d and discuss why M. NourbeSe calls motherhood a form of radical hospitality with organizing principles that stand in critical opposition to those of white supremacy and colonization. M. NourbeSe talks about a healthy distrust of the English language and the impact of a colonial education\u2014for instance, being tested on Wordsworth\u2019s daffodils on her exams when she had never seen one\u2014and the poem she wants to write about Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s golden Poui trees instead. M. NourbeSe also describes the feeling of working at the margins or brink of visible Caribbean literature, writing/living/speaking in a language that is yours but not your ancestors, and how to break open the language in order to express that which cannot be expressed in English. M. NourbeSe explains why she feels like she could only have written She Tries Her Tongue, Her Silence Softly Breaks and Looking for Livingstone in Canada, while also, at times, feeling like a disappeared writer in Canada. Rachel and M. NourbeSe reflect on the role of \u201cdifficulty\u201d in M. NourbeSe\u2019s writing, what is the \u201cright\u201d part/direction of the page, and our capacities to imagine beyond the binary of capitalism and socialism and to imagine freedom and ways of being beyond the constraints of our existing language. \n"

Steinke describes her first hot flash, how she came to be fascinated by female killer whales and how important it is to see the changes associated with menopause not as symptoms of disease but as signs of transitioning into a new phase of leadership and power. Steinke talks about how memoirs by trans writers were especially helpful for her when searching for a book to help her through this life transition. Steinke talks about how she began to think of herself as a creature/animal, back surgery, stuttering, faith, going toward brokenness rather than perfection, her mother, her spiritual practices, singing, the authentic self, and why she doesn\u2019t think trying to stay the same is a very good strategy."

The episode opens with a brief history of Taiwan and is followed by conversations that Rachel and Doreen had with two highly-regarded independent bookstores in the Taipei area.  \n\nAt Brilliant Time Bookstore, they speak with Mr. CHANG Cheng about viewing Taiwan in relationship to its neighboring Southeast Asian countries and in relationship to the many Southeast Asians living inside of Taiwan. They also speak about Mr. CHANG\u2019s lifelong dedication toward building a fair and just society in Taiwan, no matter the island\u2019s future. \nAt FemBooks, Rachel and Doreen speak with its manager LI Xiumei (Sophie) and KANG Min Jay, a professor at National Taiwan University\u2019s Graduate Institute of Building and Planning. Both talk about how they got involved with FemBooks\u2014Sophie, because of her prior history working on gender issues, and Professor Kang, because of his scholarship and activism on public spaces and realizing the unique position of independent bookstores as \u201csemi-public spaces.\u201d They also talk about the influence of Virginia Woolf and the importance of naming (instead of being named).\n\nNote: Capitalized text indicates family names (which precede given names in the Chinese language).  \n\nDoreen Wang has been the voice, mind and heart behind Commonplace\u2019s social media since September 2018. Doreen is a writer\u2014poetry and creative nonfiction, among other genres\u2014and longtime NGO worker who now manages a youth leadership program for the International Network of Engaged Buddhists, and leads food tours in Chengdu. Doreen received a poetry fellowship from Kundiman as well as a Pushcart Prize nomination for her work. You can find her work in On She Goes, Angel\u2019s Flight: Literary West, and Racist Sandwich podcast. An inaugural participant of Spotify\u2019s Sound Up Bootcamp for Women of Color Podcasters, Doreen is working on a writing and audio documentary where she and her grandmother talk story about how the borders of China-Taiwan and U.S.-Mexico have shaped their lives."

Boyer talks about a recent dream she had, the motivating fires of vengeance and love, and how to keep the door to hell open long enough to write one word at a time despite the disabling physical and emotional effects of cancer treatment. Zucker and Boyer discuss what happens when poets face the larger market, trusting readers, how to break out of the pressure to perform certain modes of self-expression, a feminist future where there can be more than one smart woman in a room, the pornography of authenticity, the relationship between poiesis and critique and why it\u2019s important to resist the allure of criticism, resisting the pressure to create spectacles of suffering, how to find the least-alienating way to be inside alienating structures, the problem with pink-ribbon culture, the shortcomings of \u201cempowerment feminism,\u201d what real solidarity might look like, why Boyer loves to write but hates to publish and hates the work of being public, harassment and abuse in the literary world, and Tolstoy\u2019s funeral."

Chang talks about learning the rules of poetry (and traditional forms) and later searching for more flexible (female? maternal?) forms like the zuihitsu that might contain shopping lists and hyperlinks and also help us speak about race, history and violence. Chang and Zucker also discuss teaching, literary influences and the effect on their mothering of having been intermittently separated from their own mothers at a young age."

They speak about Victoria\u2019s recent book Barbie Chang and about Victoria\u2019s forthcoming book, Obit, and so much more. "

Croft describes translating Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s novel <em>Flights </em>(Riverhead, 2018) for which Croft and Tokarczuk won the Man Booker International Prize, her relationship with Tokarczuk, and the pleasures and challenges of her current translation project: translating Tokarcuzk\u2019s thousand-page historical novel, <em>The Books of Jacob</em>, about 18th century figure Jacob Frank. Croft also speaks about the connection between translation and creative writing and her newly-released illustrated novel-memoir, <em>Homesick</em> (Unnamed Press, 2019) which she wrote in Spanish and then again in English.

Croft touches on existential questions about being oneself in a place where one has no history and how one\u2019s life is a mysterious interplay of destiny, accident, choice and perseverance.\n\n\nBooks by Jennifer Croft\n\n\nHomesick (Unnamed Press, 2019)\n\n\nBooks translated by Jennifer Croft\n\n\nFlights by Olga Tokarczuk (Riverhead Books, 2018)\nAugust by Romina Paula (The Feminist Press at CUNY, 2017)\nLovely, Human, True, Heartfelt: The Letters of Alina Szapocznikow and Ryszard Stanislawski (Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw, 2012)\n\n\nOther Books, Translators and Writers Mentioned in the Episode\n\n\nAron Aji\nDaniel Weissbort\nAntonia Lloyd Jones\nHanna Krall\nClaire Cavanagh\nWis\u0142awa Szymborska\nStanislaw Baranczak\nMaxine Swann\nWiltold Gombrowicz\n\n\nOther Relevant Links\n\n\nThe NIKE award\nUnnamed Press\nBoris Dralyuk\nThe New York Public Library\u2019s Cullman Center\n\u201cGdansk mayor Pawel Adamowicz dies after being stabbed in heart on stage\u201d by Helen Regan and Stephanie Wells, for CNN\n\u201cWhen An Author You Translate Gets Death Threats\u201d by Jennifer Croft, for Lithub\nNEA Translation grants\nBuenos Aires Review\nMusic for this episode provided by Payadora\n\n\nLiner notes\n\n\n14:25 \u201cLa Humilde\u201d Argentine folk song arranged and performed by Payadora.\n16:40 Jennifer Croft reads \u201cBirthday\u201d by Wis\u0142awa Szymborska translated by Wis\u0142awa Szymborska and Stanislaw Baranczak\n25:51 \u201cNostalgias Tucumanas\u201d by Atahualpa Yupanqui arranged by Drew Jurecka and performed by Payadora.\n26:30 Jennifer Croft reads from Flights by Olga Tokarczuk (Riverhead Books, 2018)\n27:33 \u201cVolando\u201d composed by Rebekah Wolkstein and performed by Payadora.\n57:58 Jennifer Croft reads her novel/memoir Homesick in Spanish and English.\n1:03:40 \u201cAdios Muchachos\u201d by Julio C\u00e9sar Sanders arranged by Rebekah Wolkstein, performed by Payadora.\n\nAll audio of Jennifer Croft was recorded by Rachel Zucker in New York City on February 13, 2018 at the Cullman Center.

Croft describes translating Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s novel Flights (Riverhead, 2018) for which Croft and Tokarczuk won the Man Booker International Prize, her relationship with Tokarczuk, and the pleasures and challenges of her current translation project: translating Tokarcuzk\u2019s thousand-page historical novel, The Books of Jacob, about 18th century figure Jacob Frank.

They talk about teaching, wanting to go back to school, and about the Bagley Wright Lecture Series conference at University of Arizona."

These three amazing artists talk about how working with DAP has affected their creative work, their teaching, their lives and their priorities. They talk about how a workshop model can be used in schools, offices, and organizations to reimagine and revitalize diversity education, the power of performance and first-person narratives, guidelines for encouraging openness and risk taking, how to invite vulnerability into the classroom in responsible ways, culture-based intentionality, the permission to start with the self, how and why to step out onto the vulnerable edge in order to dismantle the master\u2019s house, coming out, seasonal personal and political grief, and visions for expanding the DAP\u2019s reach.
