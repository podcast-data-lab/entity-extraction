(I think it was that uplifting title that caught Mike's attention.) Before discussing the importance of human contact (especially in the early developmental stages), the guys try to get back into the podcasting swing with a Free-for-All. Oliva, who has joined them for this episode, takes a stab at it, but it doesn't go so well. Fortunately Mike and Peter remember they can talk about \"civilized\" ways of disputing, so they pull it together. \r\nIt's been a bit since our last episode, we hope this gets to be a more regular thing again soon.\r\n\r\n As always, we're grateful to the 1517 podcasting network.

Daniel Waldschmidt of <a href=\"https://www.stjohnsburlington.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">St. John\u2019s Lutheran in Burlington, WI</a> in order to discuss the New Perspective on Paul. Rev. Waldschmidt patiently explains to the guys what this new view of St. Paul entails. While this topic is complicated, Rev. Waldschmidt does a nice job of explaining the basics of this view and how it doesn\u2019t match up with the traditional Reformation reading of St. Paul and his epistles. Rev. Waldschmidt is certainly qualified to speak on this topic having studied it during his Masters work at <a href=\"https://divinity.tiu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trinity International University\u2019s Divinity School</a> and having presented an essay on the topic at <a href=\"https://www.wls.wels.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wisconsin in Lutheran Seminary</a>.

The talk was given the day before Valentine's Day, but Mike assured the audience that that was mere coincidence (evidently he and Rev. Bortulin don't always remember the date of Valentines day...shocking, really).\r\n\r\nAlthough the title might suggest that Mike discussed C.S. Lewis's work The Four Loves, in reality he just stole the idea and did his own thing. If you are interested in a discussion of C.S. Lewis's work, though, we did cover that way back on Episode 45, so go check that one out. In this talk, Mike uses the structure that Lewis presents to discuss the way in which God's love for us (agape) animates all other love through us, even if imperfectly. \r\nA big thanks to St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church for inviting Mike to speak.

The guys compare and contrast Lewis\u2019 fiction with the current political climate. What is fascism? Why did Lewis think 1930\u2019s America was vulnerable to a corporate state when so many people believed \u201cit can\u2019t happen here\u201d? And could it happen in our own day? While there are some eerie similarities, the lessons to be learned from Lewis are not necessarily political but have to do with humanity, freedom, and the two kingdoms. We hope you will enjoy this foray into this Nobel Prize winner\u2019s novel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n As always, we're grateful to the <a href=\"http://www.1517.org/podcasts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1517 podcasting network</a>.

Dr. Kuehn is a physicist, which is the topic we (sort of) discussed with him on his previous episode. In this episode, however, we discuss another area that he's spent time pursuing: Apologetics.

Mike is joined by Rev. Greg Lyon once again, this time to discuss the role of Law & Gospel on a college campus and especially the relentless draw of the opinio legis. Rev.

Mike and Wade are joined in the studio by Dr. Rebecca Parker Fedewa, who is an English professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College. Dr. Parker Fedewa's dissertation focused on Elizabeth Gaskell, so the guys figured she couldn't say \"no\" if they asked her on to discuss Gaskell....and they were right (but just barely). And whether you know Gaskell's life and works well, of have never even heard of her, we think you'll dig this conversation. Before getting to the real topic, though, the trio discusses books that they know they should've read (and maybe even pretend like they have), but still haven't. \r\nA big thanks to Dr. Parker Fedewa for putting up with the guys and joining us for this episode.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in joining Wade and Mike at the 2019 Here We Still Stand conference in San Diego, head over there now to see if there are still tickets available (but hurry, this will sell out).

Mike welcomes back frequent guest Rev. Brian Doebler. Those who have heard Rev. Doebler on previous episodes might remember that he is currently working on a PhD in Missiology at Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana. As this is a topic the Rev. Doebler has thought about more than most, Mike asked him if he'd be willing to do a few episodes on different aspects of Missiology. This episode focuses on Missiology in the Old Testament.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice there's no Free-for-All again, as well as no Wade. This is not a coincidence. \r\nA big thanks to Rev. Doebler for joining us once again (and agreeing to continue to do so).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in joining Wade and Mike at the 2019 Here We Still Stand conference in San Diego, head over there now to see if there are still tickets available (but hurry, this will sell out).

It's hard to overestimate the role of music in the Reformation, and in this episdoe Dr. Zima makes that abundantly clear. <br />\r\nA big thanks to Dr. Zima for joining us again!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBooks mentioned in this episode: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t\"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Luthers-Liturgical-Music-Principles-Implications/dp/1506427154/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Luther%27s+Liturgical+Music&amp;qid=1561526707&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Luther's Liturgical Music</a>\" by Robin Leaver.<br />\r\n \t\"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Luther-Music-Paradigms-Carl-Schalk/dp/0570013372/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Luther+on+Music%3A+Paradigms+of+Praise&amp;qid=1561526736&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Luther on Music: Paradigms of Praise</a>\" by Carl Schalk.<br />\r\n \t\"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Singing-Resurrection-Community-Reformation-Cultural/dp/019066164X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Singing+the+Reformation+by+Erin+Lambert&amp;qid=1561526775&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Singing the Resurrection</a>\" by Erin Lambert.<br />\r\n \t\"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Worship-Wars-Early-Lutheranism-Congregation/dp/0195365844/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Worship+Wars+in+Early+Lutheranism&amp;qid=1561526819&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Worship Wars in Early Lutheranism</a>\" by Jospeh Herl.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're interested in joining Wade and Mike at the <a href=\"http://www.HereWeStillStand.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2019 Here We Still Stand </a>conference in San Diego, <a href=\"http://www.HereWeStillStand.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">head over there</a> now to see if there are still tickets available (but hurry, this will sell out).

Wade and Mike welcome into the studio Dr. Scott Keith who is the Executive Director of 1517 The Legacy Project and Adjunct Professor of Theology at Concordia University, Irvine. Dr. Keith is also a co-host of The Thinking Fellows Podcast, which is a fantastic podcast in the 1517 Podcast Network (which Let the Bird Fly! just happens to be a part of). In this episode Wade and Dr. Keith square off over two influential characters in the early Reformation: Philip Melanchton and Matthias Flacius Illyricus (these just so happen to be the dissertation topics of these distinguished doctors, so it's sure to be a good conversation). Before getting to the battle royale, though, the guys talk Avengers and contemporary story telling in the Free-for-all.\r\n\r\nA huge thanks to Dr. Scott Keith for joining us! We had a great time and hope we can do it again.\r\nIf you're interested in joining Wade and Mike (and Scott!) at the 2019 Here We Still Stand conference in San Diego, head over there now to see if there are still tickets available (but hurry, this will sell out).

Before diving into the main topic, the guys decided to commemorate their (official) 100th episode by asking the question Where would you most like to record an episode.

This means that they cut out the Free-for-All, which may leave you wondering how you can get them to celebrate Holy Week every week. <br />\r\nHappy Easter from Let the Bird Fly!<br />\r\nIf you are interested in joining Mike and Wade at the <a href=\"http://www.HereWeStillStand.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2019 Here We Still Stand </a>conference in San Diego, <a href=\"http://www.HereWeStillStand.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">head over there</a> now to see if there are still tickets available (but hurry, this will sell out).

Wade, Mike, and Peter are joined once again by <a href=\"https://www.letthebirdfly.com/tag/mr-josh-seeger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Josh Seeger</a> of <a href=\"https://www.wlhs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wisconsin Lutheran High School</a>. In this episode they finally\u00a0officially discuss the four Gospel accounts. If you've been listening for a while now, you know that this topic has been brushed up against once or twice in the past. As Peter likes to say for the Free-for-All, though,\u00a0this time they're going to settle the question once and for all. (Or maybe not, it is Peter that even suggests a <a href=\"https://www.letthebirdfly.com/category/wingin-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wingin' It</a> series on the four Gospel accounts....these guys sure know how to milk a topic!) Before arriving at the main topic, however, Mr. Seeger joins in the much awaited 2019 MLB\u00a0Let the Bird Fly! preview! (Some of that previous sentence may have been embellishment.) A big thanks to Mr. Seeger for taking the time to join us again. We definitely enjoyed the conversation, and we hope y'all do as well!<br />\r\nIf you'd like more information on the Apologetics course Mike mentioned at the beginning of the Free-for-All, you can find all that information <a href=\"http://www.wlc.edu/Apologetics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">right here</a>.

In many ways the transition was fairly simple: his daily schedule was not too different, he was still an academic, and he only moved across town. Yet the transition could not have been more life-altering. Listen into the conversation as the guys ask why this happened and what it meant for the Reformation.\r\n\r\nLet the Bird Fly!\u00a0is supported by the\u00a01517 Podcast Network, which is part of 1517.org. The 2018 calendar year has been one of tremendous growth for 1517 and plans for 2019 and beyond are well underway.

In the end, they take as their theme the famous Mark Twain quote: \u201cTravel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.\u201d We hope you are able to sit back and enjoy the discussion. \u00a0<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet the Bird Fly!\u00a0is supported by the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.1517.org/podcasts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1517 Podcast Network</a>, which is part of <a href=\"http://www.1517.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1517.org</a>.

Before getting into Luther\u2019s family, birth, and childhood (that\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.letthebirdfly.com/2018/12/16/wingin-it-81-2-the-life-of-luther-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">next episode</a>), they discuss why we should take an historical look at Luther. The great reformer didn\u2019t just impact the church, but the whole world, perhaps in ways we don\u2019t always realize. The guys will each reread some Luther biographies for each episode to gain a diverse perspective on Wittenberg\u2019s most famous professor, fully aware that historical books often tell us as much about the author and his or her time as the subject itself. But this will be helpful, too, as they bring the historical lessons of Luther to our contemporary situation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo with that in mind, here's a bit of a starting bibliography on the Life of Martin Luther:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Martin-Luther-Life-James-Nestingen-ebook/dp/B000W93JAM/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544243123&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=james+nestigen+martin+luther\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Martin Luther: A Life</a> by James Nestingen<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Luther-Reformer-Story-Man-Career/dp/0800635973/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544243017&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kittelson+luther\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luther the Reformer: The Story of the Man and His Career</a> by James Kittelson<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Short-Life-Martin-Luther/dp/0802871534\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Short Life of Martin Luther</a> by Thomas Kaufmann<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=lyndal+roper+luther\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Martin Luther: Renegade and Prophet</a> by Lyndal Roper<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Martin-Luther-Visionary-Scott-Hendrix-ebook/dp/B015Y1YSTI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544242777&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hendrix+martin+luther\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luther: Visionary Reformer</a> by Scott Hendrix<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Here-Stand-Life-Martin-Luther/dp/1426754434/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544242699&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bainton+luther\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here I Stand: The Life of Martin Luther</a> by Roland Bainton<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Luther-Man-Between-God-Devil/dp/0300103131/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544242577&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=oberman+luther\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luther: Man between God and the Devil</a> by Heiko Oberman<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n \t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Brand-Luther-Unheralded-Europe-Reformation/dp/0399563237/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544242463&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=brand+luther\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Luther</a> by Andrew Pettegree<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet the Bird Fly!\u00a0is supported by the\u00a0<a style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"https://www.1517.org/podcasts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1517 Podcast Network</a>, which is part of <a href=\"http://www.1517.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1517.org</a>.

The Berg girls make an appearance in\u00a0the Free-for-All to discuss what they're asking for Christmas and some of their favorite presents from years past. Wade adds a lesson learned from his own childhood as well (we're glad he got his presents back, but can understand his parents getting tired of his antics\u2014we know the feeling!). Thanks again to Brian and John for joining us.

Adam Morton to discuss\u00a0Imago Dei (or specifically what it means to be created\u00a0in the image of God). The guys recorded this episode will at the Here We Still Stand 2018 conference, which was held in October of 2018. Rev. Morton was gracious enough to sit down with the guys not once, but twice (you'll see what we mean a little over 30 minutes into the episode). Rev. Morton is currently working on his doctorate at the University of Nottingham. As is our want, however, we make you suffer through a Free-for-All before getting to the Main Topic. In this episode we bring back a favorite from way back on\u00a0Episode 3: pitcher hits or designated hitter. After roundly beating Wade, however, we move on to a wonderful conversation with Rev.

Wade was out-of-town, so the guys took over his office and invited back Rev. Dr. Mark Paustian. Dr. Paustian joined us back on Episode 60 to discuss communication, and we had such a great time we decided to get him back on, this time to discuss reading books and authors who have been deemed \"unsafe.\" Our discussion centers around \"theologically unsafe\" authors, but we also discuss this concern in a slightly broader context as well. \r\nThis is a topic that the guys had done way back on Episode 4, which is entitled Stepping outside the Fortress. So if you're a new listener (or if you just skipped that episode), you may want to go back and give that early episode a listen as well (plus you'll get the added bonus of getting to hear us stumble through one of our early episodes, which is always entertaining). As it turns out there was quite a bit to talk about with Dr. Paustian, so we had to split it into two episodes.

Rev. John Bortulin joins the guys to discuss Holy Week...and Easter 2. Rev. Bortulin is an associate pastor at St. John\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Mukwonago, WI, and was the first (adult) guest on Let the Bird Fly! That\u2019s right, Pastor Bortulin was the first person to agree to be on this very podcast, way back on Episode 3 (which, as it turns out, was also discussing Holy Week). Rev. Bortulin was also a guest on Episode 16, so if you enjoy what you hear here, go check those two episodes out! We are thrilled to have Rev. Bortulin back for this episode to discuss Holy Week...and Easter 2. Our Scripture Narrative kicks off our Holy Week discussion with Palm Sunday, and then we take a quick excursion into the world of modern medicine. Wade mentions the Wingin\u2019 It series that Mike has been spearheading on the Divine Service. You can find that entire series here, and Wade specifically mentions the episode on The Sanctus, which you can find here. Eventually we do work our way through a discussion of this holiest of weeks in Christendom.

Rev. Bror Erickson joins the guys once again via Skype to discuss the Swedish Bishop Bo Giertz. On the episode 50 Pastor Erickson joined us to discuss what led him to begin translating some of Bo Giertz\u2019s works. This time he joins us to talk about one of those works in particular. Once again instead of the normal Scripture Narrative, Wade reads a selection from one of Rev. Erickson\u2019s translations. This time it is from With My Own Eyes, which also serves as the main topic for this episode. They also find a way to talk about favorite childhood toys, which is sort of a metaphor for what the Free-for-All is anyway.\r\nIf you are familiar with Bo Giertz, it is most likely through The Hammer of God. What you may not know is that Bo Giertz was a rather prolific author, but very little has been translated into English. Thanks to our guest, however, that has been changing.

Wade and Peter welcome Rev. Bror Erickson via Skype to discuss the Swedish Bishop Bo Giertz. Pastor Erickson is the pastor at Zion Lutheran Church in Farmington, NM and has been translating works of Bo Giertz (as well as others) for a number of years and sat down with the guys to discuss the famous Swedish Bishop, in what we hope is a bit of a primer for future episodes where Rev. Erickson will discuss specific works of Giertz\u2019s that he has translated. Instead of the normal Scripture Narrative, Wade reads an ordination sermon of Giertz\u2019s that is translated by Rev. Erickson in Then Fell the Lord\u2019s Fire. In the Free-for-All we find out that Wade and Peter are far more boring than Bror (which may surprise exactly zero regular listeners), but Wade does hatch a plan to take over Mike\u2019s garage, so it wasn\u2019t a total loss for the guys.\r\nIf you are familiar with Bo Giertz, it is most likely through The Hammer of God.

Erickson on again to discuss some of the specific works that he\u2019s translated, but in this episode we ask Rev. Erickson to introduce us a bit to Bo Giertz, and himself.

Treptow served as the president of the Nebraska District of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. \r\nBefore getting to the main topic, however, Wade walks us through what Paul has to say in 1 Timothy 3 about being an overseer in the church and the guys discuss the best decades for some of their favorite sports (or sporting events, I suppose, if you\u2019re willing to allow Peter his first choice...which Ben is not).

We are thrilled that Dr. Meyer was able and willing to join us.<br />\r\nBefore discussing the Lectionary, however, Mike provides a quick overview of the Salutation and Prayer of the Day.\u00a0If you're enjoying this series, we'd be thrilled if you'd share them with friends and family.<br />\r\nAs a reminder, this is the sixth part of the series that Mike promised on <a href=\"http://www.LetTheBirdFly.com/33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Episode 33</a>, which will cover various parts of the Western Rite.

(CliffsNotes version: Mike really...um...doesn\u2019t have much to say, Wade is fascinated by existential postmodern thought, Oliva is like\u2026.um...not real sure, and Peter doesn\u2019t have much to say, per se.) Eventually they do what they promise, though, and get to C.S. Lewis\u2019 wonderful work The Four Loves.

The simul refers to the paradoxical situation in which Christians find themselves as simultaneously lost to sin (peccator) and fully redeemed by the work of Christ (iustus). In English this is often translated as: \u201cat the same time sinner and saint.\u201d This episode serves as a something of a second pass at the Law & Gospel episode that the guys did a number of episodes back. (If you haven\u2019t listened to that episode yet, we\u2019d definitely recommend doing so.)\r\nPeter was kind enough to invite the guys and their families over to Mike\u2019s house to record this episode (after a nice meal, of course), so a number of the Let the Bird Fly! children join the guys for the introduction. Wade, forgetting to prepare a Scripture Narrative for this episode, simply reads a portion of Romans 6, with almost no commentary whatsoever before they guys wrap up their thoughts on the NFL season in the Free-for-All. When they do make it to the main topic, though, the guys find that they have quite a bit to say (alright, they knew that going in, but seriously, this is a long one...we hope you can make it through). The conversation (aided by a few beverages) is free-wheeling, but we hope you find it interesting and thought-provoking. If you are able to make it through and have any thoughts or questions, be sure to share with us on Facebook or via email.\r\nAnd, if you'd like to watch the chapel devotions given by Wade and Mike, which are referenced in the episode, you can find Wade's here, and you can see Mike in his finest vestments\u00a0(along with\u00a0his much ballyhooed hand-gestures)\u00a0right here.\r\nAnd as always, if you are enjoying the show, please subscribe, rate, and review us on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, or TuneIn Radio.

(If you\u2019ve missed the previous three, you should rectify that now. You can do so by downloading Episode 5, Episode 14, and Episode 29.) Dr. Braun has been on to talk about the inter-testamental period, the split between the Missouri and Wisconsin synods, and his paper on Black Geneva Piety; but this time he is here to talk about everyone\u2019s favorite book of the Bible--Deuteronomy. He is joined by Pastor Ben Zak, who happened to be on campus and so got to join in on the fun, too. He serves at St. John Lutheran on 68th and Forest Home in Milwaukee.\r\nOn the way to the main topic, Mark, Ben, Mike and Wade talk historical blind spots--what historical or fields do they personally wish they knew more about and what would the church or society be served by learning more about, too. The main topic, as advertised, delves into the last book of the Pentateuch, Deuteronomy, and Mark's crisis of faith which led him to study it. From there the conversation expands to Moses, the Torah, the challenges and perspectives of old age, in connection with Deuteronomy telling us about the aging prophet, and taking off from there. (In one very elucidating moment Wade clarifies that he is\u00a0NOT saying \"that we should all approve of bad stuff and that we should do bad stuff,\" so make sure to keep that in mind.)\r\nAnd since we know that you\u2019ll be itching to get your hands on Dr. Braun\u2019s book on Deuteronomy, we\u2019re going to give you the chance to win one of TWO copies in our latest BOOK GIVEAWAY.

Laura and John Rigge are joined by two of their daughters, as they tell us their story of founding Grandview Valley Winery in Belview, Minnesota. John and Laura know how to treat podcast hosts, as they brought along a tasty bottle of their very own Old Red & White wine to share. As good as the wine is (and it truly is), we think you\u2019ll enjoy their stories just a much as you\u2019ll enjoy their wine. Their passion for their work and for each other is evident throughout the conversation, and we are extremely grateful to them for sharing it with us. Wade was so grateful, in fact, that he made the Rigge\u2019s the first-ever recipients of the Things Wade Likes: Let the Bird Fly!
