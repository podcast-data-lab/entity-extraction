And lo! A decor trend was born: teatowels, T-shirts, mugs, phone cases, condoms, and a zillion riffs on the phrase.  Bookshop owner Stuart Manley talks about unearthing the poster that spawned countless imitations; author Owen Hatherley explains why the poster was NOT popular when it was originally printed at the start of World War 2; and psychologist and therapist Jane Gregory considers whether being told to keep calm can keep us calm."
