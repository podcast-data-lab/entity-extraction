Maybe it was called the \"international aisle,\" or \"world foods,\" but it was the same idea. This is the \u201cIt\u2019s A Small World After All\u201d part of the shopping experience. It\u2019s where you\u2019ll find ramen next to coconut milk, next to plantain chips next to harissa. Although ethnic aisles look different in every supermarket, they\u2019re often variations on the same theme. And while so-called \u201cethnic food brands\u201d get a chance to feed the American masses, they\u2019re still confined to the ethnic aisle.

Launched in 2018 by Avery Trufelman, the show encourages people to rethink the way we look at what we wear and what it says about us.",

Mini-stories are fun, quick hit stories that came up in our research for another episode...or maybe it was some cool thing someone told us about that we found really interesting. They didn\u2019t quite warrant a full episode and two months of hard reporting, but they\u2019re great 99pi stories nonetheless. And my favorite part is we do them as unscripted interviews where I\u2019m in the studio with the people who work on this show, who I like a lot. Sometimes I know a little about what they\u2019re going to talk about, but sometimes I know nothing. It\u2019s very fun. This week we have stories of mistaken identity, unreachable iconic tour destinations, haunted architecture, and of course, raccoons.\nMini-Stories: Volume 7\nMake your mark.

They wanted a gimmick to hook new listeners, so WSAN decided to launch a good old-fashioned endurance contest, reminiscent of the pole sitting stunts or dance marathons popular in the 1920\u2019s. They secured a local sponsor, Love Homes, to donate a prize: a single-wide modular home worth $18,000.\nIt seemed like a simple marketing strategy, but WSAN had grossly underestimated just how much people would endure for a little economic security.\nBillboard Boys: The Greatest Radio Contest of All Time",

About 85 percent of Nevada, 61 percent of Alaska, 53 percent of Oregon, the list goes on. \u00a0And there have always been questions about how this immense swath of land should be used. Should we allow ranchers to graze cattle, or should the western land be a place where wild animals can roam free and be protected, or is it land we want to reserve for recreation? \u00a0As you can imagine, there is no consensus on the answers to these questions but there are a LOT of strong feelings, and over the years, those strong feelings have sometimes bubbled up to the surface and manifested in protests and even violence. In 2016, a group of armed militants occupied the\u00a0Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in western Oregon. They were led by a cattle rancher by the name of Ammon Bundy - the son of Cliven Bundy. Perhaps you heard about it but never understood exactly what it was all about.

            "contentSnippet": "This is a special presentation of episode #4 of Radiotopia's newest show ZigZag.\nManoush and Jen give themselves 36 hours in San Francisco to come up with a financial backup plan, just in case this whole blockchain-token-thing doesn\u2019t work out. Silicon Valley runs on VC money so maybe Stable Genius Productions should too? First, they talk to a well-known venture capitalist on whether aligning their mission with investor expectations is a laughable goal. Then, they visit Roman Mars, host of 99% Invisible and Radiotopia co-founder, at his headquarters in Oakland. He explains how he built his podcasting empire and advises Manoush and Jen on their plan.\nZigZag\nSubscribe in Apple Podcasts\nSubscribe in RadioPublic",
