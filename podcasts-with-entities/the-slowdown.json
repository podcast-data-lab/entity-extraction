Each time I passed that tree, I grew more attached to it. It seemed it was the only living thing in the world that wasn\u2019t asking me how I was doing or offering me some unasked for advice. And when the fall deepened and the leaves fell, it seemed to be extending some sort of goodness toward me. Like notes scattered at its roots asking me to pay attention. Each large and many-colored leaf was like a new contract with possibility. A small doorway where I might enter the world again. Enter the world through attention.</p>\n<p>To me, that is what poetry does. It offers no advice, no breaking news, no wisdom, no \u201cand the moral of the story.\u201d Instead, it offers connection and reciprocity. The inner and outer world colliding for one brief instant so that it\u2019s not about having answers, being right or being wrong, but recommitting ourselves again to the mystery, silence, and awe of the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope The Slowdown can be that type of unexpected goodness for its listeners.

It\u2019s struggle, joy, and so much more.\nRead an automated transcript\n\nOxtail Stew \nby David Dominguez\nAt five o\u2019clock in the morning,\nI walked to work and passed the green ponds\nof Horizon Park where the last bluegill,\ncaught on the low, slight bank,\npanted hard in the dark mud, crushed glass,\nsour bottle caps, whiskey,\nand the iron weight of heat and smog.\nThis haze stared through eyes\ngray as the broken window panes\non the cheap side of town,\nand when this haze held you\nand whispered in your ears its quiet tragedies,\nit stole your breath quick as time.\nThis is where men gathered to sell peanuts,\nbuckets of oranges, and roses,\nand they sat on the benches and watched\nthe trucks drive by and disappear.\n\nWhat I want to say is simple:\na man must do more than sell roses\nwhere the bums go and beg\u2014\nhe must keep something holy.\nHe must breathe the winds\nthat rustle the orchards of the valley\nwhere the white almond blooms\nreplenish with their soft scent.\nHe must learn from the Appaloosa\nwhen she walks in from the fields\nand bows her head to a trough of water\nthat reflects nothing but her eyes and the stars.\n\nShoulder, fat, bone, and loose sheet metal\nbanged out a day-long cacophony.\nTwenty-eight pounds of spice\nhad to be mixed before the grinder was done.\nMustard powder, paprika, salt,\nand chili powder boiled in my nose,\nin my eyes, and in the red throb\nof my hard nicked-up knuckles.\nBy late morning the meat defrosted,\nand the boxes began their ooze.\nPig parts became easy to recognize.\nEighty pounds of guts, kidneys,\nand stomach fell across my chest\neach time a box ripped apart.\nWe dared not stop the music of our work:\nthe clack of a clean pine pallet,\npink meat and white fat ground to a pulp,\nsweetened, stuffed, and crimped,\nthe chorizo boxed, the boxes labeled,\nstacked, and wrapped.\n\nAt lunch, I watched Guillermo hunker over the table\nand dig into his stew\u2014carrots, potatoes,\ncelery, oxtail, and gravy, made from\nchili peppers and fat, smoldering in a ceramic bowl.\nGuillermo took out a white cotton napkin\nand spread it evenly across his lap,\npicked up a piece of sourdough ripped\nfrom a loaf and soaked the bread in the stew\nfor a long time . . . his own tired body\ntaking back what the work took, and he ate.\nHe sucked on chili peppers the color of blood\nand took another bite of the bread.\nHe sucked out the beef from the eyes of the bones\nand gnawed on the soft marrow,\nand he drank hot coffee sweetened con canela.\n\u201cEloisa,\u201d he said, \u201ccan cook,\u201d and he touched\nthe brown lace crocheted into the edge\nof his cotton napkin, rubbed his gut, wiped the table,\nand walked out to complete his work.\n\n\"Oxtail Stew\" by David Dominguez, from WORK DONE RIGHT by David Dominguez, copyright \u00a9 2003 David Dominguez.
