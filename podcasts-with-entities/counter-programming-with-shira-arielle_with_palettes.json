    "description": "Counter Programming with Shira & Arielle is your new favorite coronavirus/COVID-19 distraction podcast. Join this duo as they embark on a quest to bring the world counter programming of all kinds. They'll focus on countertops (namely, they're doing a series on marble, granite, and quartz), time counters, calorie counters, counters of other kinds... Each episode will be a mix of comedy and fun facts that no one knew they ever needed. Shira and Arielle have been friends for 5 years. They met in Jackson, Mississippi during their first job post-college at the Institute of Southern Jewish Life (yes, there are Jews in Mississippi). They lived 4 doors from one another. Now that they're on opposite sides of the country and experiencing intense anxiety due to the constant barrage of bad news surrounding coronavirus, they decided they needed a distraction. This distraction comes in the form of a podcast. Shira and Arielle are bringing you... Counter Programming. Tune in for stories, useless (read v. important) facts, and so much more. Episodes will be released weekly and will be available wherever you get your podcasts.Follow us on Instagram: @counterprogrammingpodFollow Shira on Twitter: @shishimoskFollow Arielle on Twitter: @ariellethisandthatYou can email us at counterprogrammingshiraarielle@gmail.com",

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Hey, Counties!\nWe hope you\u2019re healthy, safe, and engaged with our national conversation on police brutality and racism.\nAs always, each episode of Counter Programming will focus on a \"counter\" of some sort. Today, we learn about people counters, AKA the census! \nIn this episode, we discuss the important to filling out the 2020 census! You can do it right here. It only takes 10 minutes and it helps your community immensely. \nWe also interview census expert, D'Vera Cohn. D\u2019Vera Cohn is a senior writer and editor at Pew Research Center. She studies and writes about demographics in the United States, especially the census. Cohn was a Washington Post reporter for 21 years, mainly writing about demographics, and was the newspaper\u2019s lead reporter for the 2000 census. Before joining Pew Research Center, she served as a consultant and freelance writer for the Brookings Institution and Population Reference Bureau. Cohn is a graduate of Bryn Mawr College and is a former Nieman Fellow. She is an author of studies on the marriage and birth rates in the United States, migration between the U.S. and Mexico, and U.S. population projections. Cohn manages Pew Research Center\u2019s @allthingscensus Twitter account. She has spoken at national journalism conferences about how reporters can make use of demographic data in stories and often talks about the Center\u2019s findings in print and broadcast media.\nHere's the article we referenced in the interview: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/17/its-clear-where-college-students-are-counted-in-the-2020-census-but-not-others-who-moved-due-to-covid-19/\nHere's the Sesame Street video we played: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZmLI7eYjmw\nThank you to Zari for lending your voice for the intro section of the episode!

Check back in our feed to listen to our previous episodes.\nCounterfeit history:\n\nCounterfeiting money is thought to be the world's second oldest profession.\nIt dates back to the ancient civilization of Lydia (modern day Turkey).\nCounterfeiters would shave off the edges of coins and mix the precious metals with base metals.\nIn the 1690s in England, the punishment for \"clipping silver\" was hanging, burning at the stake, and drawing and quartering.\n\nInterview with Lisa (a counterfeit coin)\nMeet Lisa, a counterfeit coin who lives in a shallow dish on a dresser in Studio City. She believes she was created in the 1760s, but appraisers believe she was created in the 1930s and made to look older. She thinks a lot about what's \"real\" and what's \"fake,\" beyond the scope of coins and currency. She's friendly with the bracelet she's situated next to and hopes to one day retire as a charm on that bracelet. Learn more in this interview!\nTop scams:\n\nThe Money Painter - JS G Boggs (started drawing in the '80s)\nHe was an artist and drew money. He never sold his counterfeit money but he would use it to pay for items and then would keep his receipts.\n\nAlbert Talton (2000s)\u00a0\nHe was able to produce and counterfeit more than $7M in faux currency which was used before he was caught in 2007.\n\nFrank Bourassa (2010s)\u00a0\nWas able to pass off more than $250M in fake money.\nOnly made $20 bills.\nHe still knows where the missing $50M is, and he is out and about since he only spent 1.5 months in jail in 2014.\n\nWayne Victor Denis - (the 90s)\nProduced $12M in fake money (only got 4 years in prison) and wrote a memoir from jail about the experience.\n\nViktor Baranov (1970s)\nReplicated the most complex Soviet coin, using a unique machine that he invented.\nHe was one of the first people to be caught and people still use his techniques today.\n\n\nThanks for tuning in! Leave us a review on Apple or a comment on Castbox.\nTweet at us. Here\u2019s Shira. Here\u2019s Arielle.\nLisa, the counterfeit coin, was played by Lisa Orkin of Project Woo Woo. \nAt the top of the show, we told you about Super Politics Podcast. Listen here! \nBuzzsprout, y'all, the best podcast host in the game.\u00a0\nThank you to Daniel Tureck, our engineer.\nThank you to Caio Slikta, our logo designer.\nOur music is called Tennessee Hayride and it\u2019s by Jason Shaw.",

Welcome to our official episode 1 of Counter Programming with Shira & Arielle. Last week, we released our intro episode. It was a chance to get to know us and why we're doing this Corona-inspired podcast. As always, each episode of Counter Programming will focus on a counter of some sort. In this episode, we're starting our series on counter*tops.* Today, we cover MARBLE.\nFind out how we *really* feel about marble countertops -- hint: it ain't lookin' good for marble.\nYou can reach us by email to tell us how YOU feel about marble - counterprogrammingshiraarielle@gmail.com. You can also reach us on Instagram - @counterprogrammingpod.\nSEND US PICTURES OF YOUR COUNTERTOPS! WE\u2019LL SHARE THEM ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIAS!\nIn this episode, we share what we're up to during isolation. Arielle made avocado bread (which is apparently a thing). Shira and her roommate, Jenna, made steak tacos using a muffin tin(!) and finished off their tequila. Of course, Tiger King has been on our minds.\n\nBackground facts on countertops:\n1. The first countertops were made of stone and wood\n2. Soapstone and slate were abundant in the Northeast so they were brought into the kitchen to be used for counters\n3. Marble was initially used because pastry chefs liked rolling their dough on it\n4. Metals such as stainless steel and nickel were used starting in the early 1900s and then became more popular\n5. Stainless steel and laminate became popular in the 1940s\nThank you oldhouseweb.com for these facts!\n\n\nLet's marble at marble:\nIt's a metamorphic rock that's commonly used for sculpture and as a building material.\u00a0\n\n\nNotable Landmarks Made with Marble:\n1. Taj Mahal\n2. The Pantheon\n3. The Washington Monument\n4. The Supreme Court Building\n5. The Parthenon (sort of - the foundation is limestone but the tiles are marble)\n\n\nBenefits of a marble countertop:\n- The look - it's beautiful, it's warm\n- Marble has a \"nice character\"\n- Each piece is unique\n- It has elegant veining and a sophisticated appearance\n\u00a0\nDisadvantages of a marble countertop:\n- It's a porous material\n- It can stain\n- It's soft so it can chip and scratch\n- It's expensive (more expensive than wood, laminate, and tile)\n- Low resistance to heat\n\n\nWould Shira and Arielle get marble in their future kitchens? NO.\nCome back next week as we explore another countertop.\u00a0\n\n\nThanks for tuning in!
