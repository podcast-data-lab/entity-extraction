    "description": "Huberman Lab discusses neuroscience: how our brain and its connections with the organs of our body control our perceptions, our behaviors, and our health. We also discuss existing and emerging tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works. Dr. Andrew Huberman is a tenured professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. His laboratory studies neural regeneration, neuroplasticity, and brain states such as stress, focus, fear, and optimal performance. For more than 20 years, Dr. Huberman has consistently published original research findings and review articles in top-level peer-reviewed journals, including Nature, Science, Cell, Neuron, and Current Biology. He is a regular member of several National Institutes of Health review panels and a Fellow of the McKnight Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts. Dr. Huberman regularly consults for technology development companies, professional athletic organizations, and various units of U.S. and Canadian Special Operations.",

He is the author of the book, \u201cTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic.\u201d Dr. Conti explains how to find, develop and strengthen healthy relationships \u2014 including romantic relationships, work and colleague relationships, and friendships. He explains a roadmap of the conscious and unconscious mind that can allow anyone to navigate conflicts better and set healthy boundaries in relationships. We also discuss common features of unhealthy relationships and clinically supported tools for dealing with relationship insecurity, excessive anxiety, past traumas, manipulation and abuse. Dr. Conti explains how, in healthy relationships, there emerges a dynamic of the mutually generative \u201cus\u201d and how to continually improve that dynamic.

I explain the data showing how music can increase motivation for cognitive or physical work, what specific music has been shown to enhance cognitive performance, and whether silence or music is more effective in enhancing focus while studying. I also discuss how specific musical pieces can rapidly reduce anxiety, as well as certain prescription medications. I explain how listening to certain types of music can improve various health metrics (e.g., heart rate).

We also discuss our internal driving forces, how to align them and ultimately, how to cultivate a powerful \u201cgenerative drive\u201d of positive, aspirational pursuits.

Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, over-thinking and how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate. This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns and behaviors \u2014 either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional. The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.\nFor the full show notes, including articles, books, and other resources, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1:\u00a0https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous:\u00a0https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Paul Conti\n(00:03:46) Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up App\n(00:06:55) What is a Healthy Self?\n(00:10:41) Agency & Gratitude; Empowerment & Humility\u00a0\n(00:16:13) Physical Health & Mental Health Parallels\n(00:20:21) Structure of Self; Unconscious vs. Conscious Mind; \u201cIceberg\u201d\n(00:26:15) Defense Mechanisms; Character Structure \u201cNest\u201d, Sense of Self\u00a0\n(00:31:27) Predispositions & Character Structure\n(00:36:01) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:37:27) Character Structure & Action States; Physical Health Parallels\n(00:46:20) Anxiety; Understanding Excessive Anxiety\n(00:53:12) Improving Confidence: State Dependence & Phenomenology; Narcissism\n(00:59:44) Changing Beliefs & Internal Narratives\n(01:06:04) Individuality & Addressing Mental Health Challenges\n(01:11:21) Mental Health Goals & Growth\n(01:17:32) Function of Self\n(01:23:00) Defense Mechanisms: Projection, Displacement\n(01:30:14) Projection, Displacement, Projective Identification\n(01:34:50) Humor, Sarcasm, Cynicism\n(01:40:41) Attention & Salience; Negative Internal Dialogue\u00a0\n(01:45:02) Repetition Compulsion & Defense Mechanism, Trauma\n(01:58:55) Mirror Meditation & Self Awareness; Structure & Function of Self, \u201cCupboards\u201d\n(02:04:57) Pillars of the Mind, Agency & Gratitude, Happiness\n(02:13:53) Generative Drive, Aggressive & Pleasure Drives\n(02:21:33) Peace, Contentment & Delight, Generative Drive; Amplification\n(02:24:18) Generative Drive, Amplification & Overcoming\n(02:33:00) Over-Thinking, Procrastination, Choices\n(02:42:20) Aggressive, Pleasure & Generative Drives, Envy\n(02:49:46) Envy, Destruction, Mass Shootings\n(02:55:38) Demoralization, Isolation, Low Aggressive Drive\n(03:02:50) Demoralization, Affiliate Defense\u00a0\n(03:09:32) Strong Aggressive Drive, Competition, Generative Drive Reframing\u00a0\n(03:20:02) Cultivating a Generative Drive, Spirited Inquiry of the \u201cCupboards\u201d\n(03:26:06) Current Mental Health Care & Medications\n(03:35:33) Role of Medicine in Exploration\n(03:40:41) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We discuss what it takes to be a true innovator, including the personality traits required, the role of environment and the support systems needed to bring revolutionary ideas to fruition. We discuss risk-taking as a necessary but potentially hazardous trait, as well as the role of intrinsic motivation and one\u2019s ability to navigate uncertainty.

I also explain research-supported tools to improve your performance during cognitive or physical goal work \u2014 including directed visualization, variable reward timing, and optimizing your physical environment.

I explain how ketamine impacts both the brain\u2019s glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term \u2018K-holes\u2019).

We discuss the brain\u2019s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders.

First, I explain the essential components of a well-rounded fitness program for lifelong health and performance including the minimum requirements for progressive resistance and cardiovascular training. Then, I discuss 12 valuable science-supported fitness tools that take a small amount of time to implement, yet all of which can greatly enhance your level of fitness. These include short endurance-enhancing and strength and hypertrophy-enhancing tools, as well as psychological, respiration (breathing), nutrition and supplementation-based tools \u2014 all of which will improve your fitness in meaningful ways and can be easily layered into existing exercise programs to improve your fitness and performance outcomes.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Tools to Improve Fitness\n(00:02:36) Sponsors: LMNT & Helix Sleep\n(00:05:13) Foundational Fitness Program\n(00:13:33) Tool 1: Zone 2 Cardio & Daily Activities\n(00:20:33) Tool 2: Low Repetition Strength Training, 3 x 5 Protocol, Warm-Up Sets\n(00:33:11) Age-Related Strength Decline\n(00:36:53) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:38:08) Tool 3: \u201cSugarcane\u201d Endurance Protocol\n(00:43:29) Tool 4: Exercise \u201cSnacks\u201d; Cardiovascular & Muscular Endurance\n(00:55:31) Tool 5: Rest Period & Physiological Sighs\n(00:01:20) Tool 6: Down-Regulation Breathing & Recovery\n(01:04:32) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:05:38) Tool 7: \u201cThe Line\u201d\n(01:09:55) Tool 8: Smartphone Use & Training\n(01:13:44) Tool 9: Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n(01:15:37) Tool 10: Creatine\n(01:20:080 Tool 11: Rhodiola Rosea\n(01:25:13) Tool 12: Training Fasted or Fed, Caffeine\n(01:31:09) Training Session Flexibility\n(01:33:37) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We discuss Tim\u2019s process of exploration, experimentation and mastery \u2014 themes that have spanned his career that have placed him on the cutting-edge of many important fields. Tim explains what questions to ask when approaching any new endeavor in order to maximize success. He also explains how to incorporate structure and playfulness into skill and knowledge mastery, how to find and work with mentors, the key importance of location and networks in creating truly impactful things. We also discuss Tim\u2019s philanthropic efforts to support research on psychedelics for the treatment of mental health challenges and we discuss his latest creative endeavors. This episode should be of interest to a wide range of listeners, as Tim\u2019s mastery and wisdom spans athletic and mental pursuits, business, media, technology and the arts.

Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped.

I explain the brain circuits involved in focus and the key roles dopamine and norepinephrine play in their regulation. Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped.

He is one of leading researchers in the study of how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition. We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye-masks to encourage people to \u201cgo internal,\u201d and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We discuss micodosing vs. macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also discuss the current legal landscape around psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for medical health disorders, but they are not without their risks.

I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges.

He explains how smell is a crucial component of \u201csocial sensing\u201d and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis.

Dr. Sobel explains his lab\u2019s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (\u201colfaction\u201d) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of \u201csocial sensing\u201d and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners.

Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink\u2019s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to 1) restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s Disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink\u2019s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip into his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink\u2019s bold and unique mission.

Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair \u201cdead\u201d (bald) zones.

We discuss his lab\u2019s discovery that \u201ctime-restricted eating\u201d (TRE) aka intermittent fasting, is beneficial effects for metabolic health and longevity. Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and also longer fasts, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases, and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Satchin Panda\n(00:03:18) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:07:24) Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) & Health\n(00:14:38) Mealtimes & Circadian Clock\n(00:21:34) Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion\n(00:25:28) Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat\n(00:28:45) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:34:04) CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm & Longevity\n(00:47:20) Gender, Hormones & CR; Relative Energy Deficient in Sports (REDS)\n(00:52:40) Physical Activity, Nutrition & Feeding Window\n(00:59:04) Nutrition Timing, Quality & Quantity; Low- Carbohydrate Diet\n(01:03:00) Caffeine, Nighttime Socialization, Fire, Breakfast\n(01:16:20) Circadian Rhythm, \u201cNight Owls\u201d & Genetics\n(01:26:37) Morning vs. Nighttime Discussions, \u201cMe Time\u201d\n(01:30:08) Light Sensitivity & \u201cNight Owls\u201d; Puberty, Melatonin\n(01:36:05) Shift Workers, Health & Disease\n(01:45:43) Artificial Lights, Young Adults & Sleep, Metabolic Dysfunction\n(01:50:59) Firefighters, Sleep & TRE; Cardiovascular Health, Blood Glucose\n(02:05:18) Shift Workers & Sleep; Alcohol & Caffeine\n(02:09:15) 12- Hour Feeding Window for Adults & Children, Sleep\n(02:22:10) Meal Timing\n(02:25:20) \u201cComplete Fast\u201d, Longer Fasts, Physical Health & Mental Health\n(02:28:12) \u201cFat Fasting\u201d, Blood Glucose & Insulin\n(02:31:57) Fasting, Metformin, Rapamycin & Longevity; Human Applicability?\n(02:39:14) Circadian Rhythm & Metabolism\n(02:41:36) Ontime Health App, Circadian Clock App\n(02:46:17) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/dr-satchin-panda-intermittent-fasting-to-improve-health-cognition-and-longevity/\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Satchin Panda</p><p>(00:03:18) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(00:07:24) Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) &amp; Health</p><p>(00:14:38) Mealtimes &amp; Circadian Clock</p><p>(00:21:34) Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion</p><p>(00:25:28) Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat</p><p>(00:28:45) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:34:04) CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm &amp; Longevity</p><p>(00:47:20) Gender, Hormones &amp; CR; Relative Energy Deficient in Sports (REDS)</p><p>(00:52:40) Physical Activity, Nutrition &amp; Feeding Window</p><p>(00:59:04) Nutrition Timing, Quality &amp; Quantity; Low- Carbohydrate Diet</p><p>(01:03:00) Caffeine, Nighttime Socialization, Fire, Breakfast</p><p>(01:16:20) Circadian Rhythm, \u201cNight Owls\u201d &amp; Genetics</p><p>(01:26:37) Morning vs. Nighttime Discussions, \u201cMe Time\u201d</p><p>(01:30:08) Light Sensitivity &amp; \u201cNight Owls\u201d; Puberty, Melatonin</p><p>(01:36:05) Shift Workers, Health &amp; Disease</p><p>(01:45:43) Artificial Lights, Young Adults &amp; Sleep, Metabolic Dysfunction</p><p>(01:50:59) Firefighters, Sleep &amp; TRE; Cardiovascular Health, Blood Glucose</p><p>(02:05:18) Shift Workers &amp; Sleep; Alcohol &amp; Caffeine</p><p>(02:09:15) 12- Hour Feeding Window for Adults &amp; Children, Sleep</p><p>(02:22:10) Meal Timing</p><p>(02:25:20) \u201cComplete Fast\u201d, Longer Fasts, Physical Health &amp; Mental Health</p><p>(02:28:12) \u201cFat Fasting\u201d, Blood Glucose &amp; Insulin</p><p>(02:31:57) Fasting, Metformin, Rapamycin &amp; Longevity; Human Applicability?</p><p>(02:39:14) Circadian Rhythm &amp; Metabolism</p><p>(02:41:36) Ontime Health App, Circadian Clock App</p><p>(02:46:17) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p>Title Card Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://www.blabacphoto.com/\">Mike Blabac</a></p><p><a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\">Disclaimer</a></p>\n      ",

We cover macronutrient guidelines, when to eat relative to training and training fasted versus fed. Dr. Galpin describes proper hydration for before and during exercise, how dehydration and/or low electrolyte concentrations impede physical and mental performance. He discusses what supplements work best for fitness and performance, how to decide which to take, if any, and when to take them.

I discuss the positive benefits of breathing properly for mood, to reduce psychological and physiological stress, to halt sleep apnea, and improve facial aesthetics and immune system function. I also compare what is known about the effects and effectiveness of different breathing techniques, including physiological sighs, box breathing and cyclic hyperventilation, \u201cWim Hof Method,\u201d Pr\u0101n\u0101y\u0101ma yogic breathing and more. I also describe how to breath to optimize learning, memory and reaction time and I explain breathing at high altitudes, why \u201coverbreathing\u201d is bad, and how to breathe specifically to relieve cramps and hiccups.

He explains the cellular mechanisms of muscle soreness and pain, why adequate recovery is essential for all physical adaptations, and how to enhance recovery using breathwork, thermal, movement, and pressure-based techniques. He describes how overtraining impedes exercise progress and how to assess if you are overreaching or overtraining, by using specific biomarkers and indicators. Like other performance metrics, recovery is a skill that can and should be trained, and that can be learned.

He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance.

He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss.

When most people hear about \u201csupplements,\u201d they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can\u2019t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss \u201cfoundational\u201d supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively.

This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1:\u00a0https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT:\u00a0https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Supplements\n(00:03:38) Hierarchy of Tools/Interventions, Developing a Supplementation Protocol\n(00:12:09) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:15:38) Role of Supplements, Foundational Supplements, Water/Fat-Soluble Vitamins\n(00:21:07) Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule\n(00:25:25) Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens\n(00:28:04) Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition\n(00:32:09) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:33:06) Supplements for Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog\n(00:36:44) Adaptogens & Broad-Spectrum Foundational Supplements\n(00:38:35) Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs\n(00:43:45) Supplements to Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine\n(00:50:52) Supplements for Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin\n(00:55:55) Melatonin Caution\n(00:58:11) Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects\n(01:03:53) Nutrition & Behavior for Hormone Health\n(01:08:59) Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root\u00a0\n(01:12:48) Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions\u00a0\n(01:16:04) Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork\u00a0\n(01:23:06) Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido\u00a0\n(01:27:24) Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility\n(01:30:54) Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine\u00a0\n(01:36:57) Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine\n(01:38:55) Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements\n(01:43:58) Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n(01:47:25) Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein\u00a0\n(01:50:09) Kids, Aging & Supplements\n(01:55:25) A Rational Supplementation Protocol\n(01:58:36) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac"

He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding \u201cthe self\u201d and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one\u2019s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (\u201cchatter\u201d) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam\u2019s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Sam Harris\u00a0\n(00:04:54) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:08:54) Sense of Self & Meditation, Dualism of Self\n(00:18:07) Sense of Self in Brain & Body\u00a0\n(00:25:28) Consciousness vs. Contents, Meditation\n(00:28:25) Interrupting Sense of Self & Attentional Focus, Visual Saccade\u00a0\n(00:33:30) Observer & Actor, Default Mode Network & Meditation, Blind Spot\n(00:36:52) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:41:57) Mediation & Paths to Understanding Consciousness, Non-Dualistic Experience\n(00:57:32) Sense of Self throughout Evolution\u00a0\n(01:07:40) Sense of Self from Human Development, Language\n(01:19:46) Internal Dialogue, Distractibility & Mindfulness\u00a0\n(01:26:27) Time Perception & Mindfulness, Vipassana Meditation, Resistance & Pain\n(01:37:13) Consciousness & Sense of Control, Free Will\n(01:43:14) Authoring Thoughts: Storytelling & Ideas, Free Will\n(01:52:11) Meditation & the Paradoxical Search for Self\n(02:06:44) Meditation & Concentration Practice\u00a0\n(02:11:58) Mindfulness, \u201cSkylike Mind\u201d & Thoughts\n(02:15:11) States of Self & Context, Dualistic Experiences\n(02:32:39) Distraction & Identification of Thoughts, Meditation & \u201cFlow\u201d States\n(02:42:58) Eyes-Open Meditations, Sense of Self, Visual Cues & Social Interactions\n(02:54:59) Paths to Meditation, Mindfulness Meditation Step-Functions\n(03:05:58) Psychedelics, MDMA & Experiences in Consciousness, Religion\n(03:21:11) Meditation, Psychedelic Journeys & Inner Truths\n(03:29:48) Psilocybin, Ego-Dissolution & Thought Expansion\n(03:40:09) Process vs. Achievement of Goals, Fulfillment in Present\n(03:54:29) Leaving Twitter; Conflict, Life Interruption & Politics\u00a0\n(04:06:14) Social Media, Attentional Disruption & Deep Work\n(04:15:39) Meditation & Sense of Self\n(04:19:02) Sam Harris & Waking Up App, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

                "summary": "My guest is Sam Harris, Ph.D. Sam earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding \u201cthe self\u201d and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one\u2019s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (\u201cchatter\u201d) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam\u2019s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Sam Harris\u00a0\n(00:04:54) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:08:54) Sense of Self & Meditation, Dualism of Self\n(00:18:07) Sense of Self in Brain & Body\u00a0\n(00:25:28) Consciousness vs. Contents, Meditation\n(00:28:25) Interrupting Sense of Self & Attentional Focus, Visual Saccade\u00a0\n(00:33:30) Observer & Actor, Default Mode Network & Meditation, Blind Spot\n(00:36:52) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:41:57) Mediation & Paths to Understanding Consciousness, Non-Dualistic Experience\n(00:57:32) Sense of Self throughout Evolution\u00a0\n(01:07:40) Sense of Self from Human Development, Language\n(01:19:46) Internal Dialogue, Distractibility & Mindfulness\u00a0\n(01:26:27) Time Perception & Mindfulness, Vipassana Meditation, Resistance & Pain\n(01:37:13) Consciousness & Sense of Control, Free Will\n(01:43:14) Authoring Thoughts: Storytelling & Ideas, Free Will\n(01:52:11) Meditation & the Paradoxical Search for Self\n(02:06:44) Meditation & Concentration Practice\u00a0\n(02:11:58) Mindfulness, \u201cSkylike Mind\u201d & Thoughts\n(02:15:11) States of Self & Context, Dualistic Experiences\n(02:32:39) Distraction & Identification of Thoughts, Meditation & \u201cFlow\u201d States\n(02:42:58) Eyes-Open Meditations, Sense of Self, Visual Cues & Social Interactions\n(02:54:59) Paths to Meditation, Mindfulness Meditation Step-Functions\n(03:05:58) Psychedelics, MDMA & Experiences in Consciousness, Religion\n(03:21:11) Meditation, Psychedelic Journeys & Inner Truths\n(03:29:48) Psilocybin, Ego-Dissolution & Thought Expansion\n(03:40:09) Process vs. Achievement of Goals, Fulfillment in Present\n(03:54:29) Leaving Twitter; Conflict, Life Interruption & Politics\u00a0\n(04:06:14) Social Media, Attentional Disruption & Deep Work\n(04:15:39) Meditation & Sense of Self\n(04:19:02) Sam Harris & Waking Up App, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac"

                "summary": "My guest is Jocko Willink, a retired Navy SEAL officer and author of multiple books on effective leadership and teamwork, self-discipline and mindset, and host of the Jocko Podcast. We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to\u00a0adapt the self to novel and challenging situations, using specific daily routines.\u00a0We consider how \u201cenergy\u201d actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and\u00a0scientific mechanisms for leveraging\u00a0exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity. And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for \u2018detachment\u2019 as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life.\u00a0Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Jocko Willink\n(00:03:50) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:08:42) Sense of Self, Discovery & Autonomy\n(00:19:11) Mindsets in the Military: Garrison vs. Combat\n(00:25:02) Military Divisions\n(00:29:34) Daily Workouts & Discipline\n(00:35:39) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:36:53) Energy & Movement, Cortisol, Nutrition\n(00:52:10) Exercise & Energy, Deliberate Cold Exposure\n(00:59:05) Win vs. Loss Mindset, Leadership, Action & Energy\u00a0\n(01:13:11) Confidence, Generators vs. Projectors, Family\n(01:24:01) Restoring Motivation: Social Connection & Play\n(01:32:44) Self-Identity & Context, Alcohol, Music, Dopamine\n(01:45:10) Motivation Sources & Recovering from Loss\n(01:54:05) Suicide, Navy SEALs, Social Contagion\n(02:09:00) Suicide, Alcohol, Positive Action\u00a0\n(02:15:03) Meditation, Detachment\n(02:20:30) Adaptability & Opportunities, Navy SEALs\u00a0\n(02:30:43) Ambition & Love, Likeability, Leadership\n(02:40:18) Building Teams, Detachment, Family\n(02:50:20) Detachment: Problems & Perspective\n(02:55:55) Tools: Strategies to Detach from Situation\n(03:08:31) Tool: Situational Awareness & Detachment\n(03:17:49) Social Media, Personal Flaws\n(03:23:01) Falling Asleep & Detachment\n(03:27:02) Resilience Calibration, Navy SEAL Training & Combat\n(03:39:16) Deliberate Discomfort & Mental Resilience\n(03:42:21) People & Animals, Personalities\n(03:51:25) Political Leadership & Military, Social Media\n(04:01:38) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac"

We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise, and supplementation (including discussions on tongkat ali,\u00a0fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more). We explain how puberty and aging affect hormone levels, how to use bloodwork to monitor hormone levels, how hormone health impacts fertility, libido, hair loss, and prostate health, and describe behaviors that negatively impact testosterone levels. We also discuss how to approach prescription hormone therapies, including which biomarkers to monitor when using these approaches and how to optimize synergistic hormones (e.g., growth hormone and thyroid hormone) to support complete hormone health safely and rationally.

We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise, and supplementation (including discussions on tongkat ali,\u00a0fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more). We explain how puberty and aging affect hormone levels, how to use bloodwork to monitor hormone levels, how hormone health impacts fertility, libido, hair loss, and prostate health, and describe behaviors that negatively impact testosterone levels. We also discuss how to approach prescription hormone therapies, including which biomarkers to monitor when using these approaches and how to optimize synergistic hormones (e.g., growth hormone and thyroid hormone) to support complete hormone health safely and rationally.

First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel \u2014 which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\nSubscribe to Huberman Lab Premium at https://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:00:54) Are there any science-backed protocols to increase deep sleep?\n(00:28:11) Huberman Lab Premium\nIn the full 1.5 hour AMA episode, we discuss:\n\nWhat is your studying routine?\n\nWhat's the ideal amount of protein intake?\n\nAny tips to eliminate sugar cravings?\n\nWhat can we do when we wake up early in the morning before the sun is up and can\u2019t benefit from direct sunlight exposure?\n\nIs it better to do shorter bouts of dynamic stretching more frequently throughout the day or longer bouts but multiple times per week?\n\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness.

We discuss Lex\u2019s recent trip to the heart of the Ukrainian-Russian War, geopolitics, perspectives on people living in war zones, the shared human experience, and how information is communicated and controlled. As an experienced podcaster and public educator, Dr. Fridman offers unique insights into the art of holding conversations that grow understanding, especially when they involve people with opposing viewpoints. We also discuss the peer-review process for scientific research publications and how social media and podcasts are evolving the way science and technology are communicated.

He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility.

I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level.\u00a0I also explain the concept behind the \u201cthird-eye center,\u201d what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability. Whether you are a novice or an experienced meditator or simply interested in how our brain controls different aspects of conscious awareness and self-regulation, this episode should interest you.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens):\u00a0https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Meditation\n(00:04:48) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:08:25) Brief History of Meditation: Consciousness, Psychedelics, fMRI\n(00:16:19) How the Brain Interprets the Body & Surrounding Environment; Mindfulness\n(00:26:07) Neuroscience of Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights\n(00:31:58) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:33:41) Interoception vs. Exteroception\n(00:42:20) Default Mode Network, Continuum of Interoception & Exteroception\n(00:53:30) Tools: Interoceptive or Exteroceptive Bias, Meditation Challenge\n(01:01:48) State & Trait Changes, Interoceptive & Exteroceptive Meditations, Refocusing\n(01:07:35) Tool: Brief Meditations, Waking Up App\n(01:10:30) \u201cThird Eye Center\u201d & Wandering Thoughts\n(01:20:46) Meditation: Practice Types, Focal Points & Consistency\n(01:24:10) Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception\n(01:30:41) Tool: Meditation Breathwork, Cyclic vs. Complex Breathwork\n(01:39:22) Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma\n(01:47:43) Model of Interoception & Dissociation Continuum\n(01:53:39) Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge\n(02:00:18) Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)\n(02:11:33) Choosing a Meditative Practice; Hypnosis\n(02:14:53) Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)\n(02:25:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Finally, we consider the future: how modern neuroscience is overturning textbook medical books, the impact of digital technology such as smartphones on language and the future of natural and computer-assisted human communication.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens):\u00a0https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Eddie Chang, Speech & Language\n(00:03:16) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:07:19) Neuroplasticity, Learning of Speech & Environmental Sounds\n(00:13:10) White Noise Machines, Infant Sleep & Sensitization\n(00:17:26) Mapping Speech & Language in the Brain\n(00:24:26) Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy\n(00:30:19) Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery\n(00:33:01) Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy\n(00:34:04) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:36:10) Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Other Seizure Types\n(00:41:08) Brain Areas for Speech & Language, Broca\u2019s & Wernicke\u2019s Areas, New Findings\n(00:53:23) Lateralization of Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes\n(00:59:05) Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits\n(01:01:18) Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction from Ear to Brain\n(01:12:38) Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations\n(01:17:37) Mapping Language in the Brain\n(01:20:26) Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages\n(01:25:07) Motor Patterns of Speech & Language\n(01:28:33) Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments\n(01:34:47) Evolution of Language\n(01:37:54) Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome\n(01:40:31) Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory\n(01:45:26) Paralysis, ALS, \u201cLocked-In Syndrome\u201d & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)\n(02:02:14) Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation\n(02:10:21) Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars\n(02:17:35) Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment\n(02:22:55) Tools: Practices for Maintaining Calm Under Extreme Demands\n(02:31:10) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state.

I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state.

He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams\u2019 work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams\u2019 knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Nolan Williams, Brain Stimulation & Depression Treatment\n(00:03:48) Sponsors: LMNT\n(00:09:16) Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments\n(00:15:11) The Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex\n(00:17:51) Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome\n(00:22:34) Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\n(00:33:02) Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS\n(00:35:30) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:39:00) Belief/Identity \u201cRules\u201d, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy\n(00:45:49) Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment\n(00:48:36) Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia\n(00:54:27) Ketamine, the Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience or Biology?\n(01:03:42) SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance or Circuit?\n(01:13:58) Memories & \u201cRule\u201d Creation; Psilocybin & \u201cRule\u201d Resolution\n(01:21:00) MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin & Depression Treatment\n(01:24:12) Is MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin\n(01:30:38) Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment\n(01:34:53) Exposure Response Prevention: \u201cLetting Go\u201d & Depression Treatment\n(01:41:23) Normal Spectrums for Mental Health Disorders\n(01:45:35) Ibogaine & \u201cLife Review\u201d; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials\n(01:57:16) Clinical Use of Psychedelics\n(02:01:59) Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study\n(02:06:55) Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses\n(02:14:52) Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol\n(02:20:42) Circadian Reset for Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light\n(02:28:43) Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study\n(02:34:25) Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation\n(02:45:35) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams\u2019 knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Nolan Williams, Brain Stimulation & Depression Treatment\n(00:03:48) Sponsors: LMNT\n(00:09:16) Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments\n(00:15:11) The Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex\n(00:17:51) Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome\n(00:22:34) Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\n(00:33:02) Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS\n(00:35:30) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:39:00) Belief/Identity \u201cRules\u201d, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy\n(00:45:49) Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment\n(00:48:36) Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia\n(00:54:27) Ketamine, the Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience or Biology?\n(01:03:42) SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance or Circuit?\n(01:13:58) Memories & \u201cRule\u201d Creation; Psilocybin & \u201cRule\u201d Resolution\n(01:21:00) MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin & Depression Treatment\n(01:24:12) Is MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin\n(01:30:38) Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment\n(01:34:53) Exposure Response Prevention: \u201cLetting Go\u201d & Depression Treatment\n(01:41:23) Normal Spectrums for Mental Health Disorders\n(01:45:35) Ibogaine & \u201cLife Review\u201d; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials\n(01:57:16) Clinical Use of Psychedelics\n(02:01:59) Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study\n(02:06:55) Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses\n(02:14:52) Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol\n(02:20:42) Circadian Reset for Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light\n(02:28:43) Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study\n(02:34:25) Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation\n(02:45:35) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams\u2019 work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children.

As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Cannabis (Marijuana)\n(00:005:02) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:07:03) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Sleep & Anxiety\n(00:15:08) Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD\n(00:19:34) Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects\n(00:25:55) Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains\n(00:31:56) Naturally Occurring Receptors: Nicotinic & Cannabinoid Receptors (CB1)\n(00:35:18) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:40:35) THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence\n(00:43:14) Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System Function\n(00:53:07) Biological Effects of Cannabis\n(00:56:29) Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia\n(01:04:58) Cannabis Indica & Subjective Effects, Memory, Dosage\n(01:09:41) Brain Areas Affected by THC & CBD, Side Effects\n(01:16:08) Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine\n(01:26:41) Does Cannabis Increase Creativity?\n(01:35:08) Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes in Speech Patterns\n(01:46:46) Cannabis & Libido, Dopamine & Prolactin\n(01:56:55) Cannabis & Hormones: Prolactin, Testosterone, Estrogen & Fertility\n(02:06:53) Smoking/Vaping Tobacco or Cannabis & Negative Health Consequences\n(02:10:06) Avoiding Cannabis During Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural Development\n(02:18:13) Negative Health Consequences of Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance\n(02:25:57) Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition to Psychosis\n(02:34:36) Adolescent Cannabis Use: Brain Development & Mental Health Disorders\n(02:41:44) Cannabis & Pain Management, Divergent Effects of Cannabis\n(02:44:54) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn\n\u00a0Title Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

                "summary": "My guest is Casey Halpern, M.D., Chief of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery and Professor of Neurosurgery at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Halpern\u2019s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders (e.g., binge eating disorders, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease essential tremor, dystonia). We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and applying this treatment to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore applications of this technology to other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and the future therapeutic directions of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions. This episode will interest those curious about the biology of eating, anorexia, bulimia, compulsive thoughts and behaviors, and movement.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Casey Halpern & Disordered Eating & Brain Stimulation\n(00:03:35) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:08:28) Neurosurgeon\u2019s View of the Brain, Neurosurgery Specialization\n(00:13:05) Deep Brain Stimulation & Other Unexpected Positive Effects\n(00:17:20) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Prescriptions & Cognitive Therapies\n(00:25:40) Brain Areas in OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction\n(00:29:30) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:32:27) Facial and Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition\n(00:39:28) Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity\n(00:47:18) Stimulation of Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation\n(00:49:49) Binge Eating Disorder & Loss of Control Eating\n(00:53:02) Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress\n(01:02:07) Electrodes in Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying \u201cCraving Cells\u201d\n(01:11:41) Effects of Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation\n(01:16:46) Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments for Anorexia\n(01:23:14) Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\n(01:32:27) MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson\u2019s\n(01:36:40) Future of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression\n(01:41:51) Pre-Behavioral States in Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation\n(01:48:02) Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions\n(01:53:05) Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts\n(01:59:00) \u201cNeurosurgeon Calm,\u201d Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training\n(02:09:53) Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation\n(02:11:59)\u00a0Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn\n\u00a0Title Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior.

I explain science-supported strategies for transitioning into focus, maintaining focus during the work bout, and exiting the focus session, which is also critical, including decompression/defocusing tools. I explain when and how to use: binaural beats, caffeine, deliberate cold exposure, the pros and cons of working in fasted vs. fed states, and supplements and foods that enhance dopamine, epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and acetylcholine to promote optimal focus. Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term. As deep focus is crucial to significantly improve cognitive or physical performance in any realm, this episode should be useful to anyone. By the end, you\u2019ll have an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost focus and concentration strategies to select from that can be tailored to your physical and mental performance needs.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Focus Toolkit\u00a0\n(00:04:42) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:09:37) The \u201cArrow Model\u201d of Focus: Epinephrine, Acetylcholine & Dopamine\n(00:15:15) Modulation vs. Mediation, Importance of Sleep\n(00:18:11) Tool: Binaural Beats to Improve Concentration\u00a0\n(00:20:54) Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition to Focused State\n(00:22:55) Warm-Up for Cognitive Work, Refocusing Attention & Neuroplasticity\u00a0\n(00:26:14) Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing\u00a0\n(00:31:22) How Many Daily Ultradian Cycles Can One Perform?\u00a0\n(00:32:28) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:35:35) Virtusan: Mental & Physical Health Journeys\u00a0\n(00:36:52) Tool: Fasted vs. Fed States & Focus, Prevent an Afternoon Crash, Ketosis\n(00:45:52) Tool: Foods to Improve Focus & Regulating Food Volume\n(00:47:53) Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness\n(00:52:55) Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration\u00a0\n(00:55:46) Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine\u00a0\n(01:00:39) Layer Focusing Tools & Design Your Own Protocols\u00a0\n(01:01:19) Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability to Refocus\u00a0\n(01:07:40) Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods\n(01:12:13) Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States\n(01:16:07) Optimal Time of Day to Use Specific Tools\n(01:16:46) Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze\u00a0\n(01:20:42) Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work\u00a0\n(01:24:43) Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids\u00a0\n(01:27:28) Tool: Creatine Monohydrate\u00a0\n(01:29:10) Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk of Stroke? & Garlic\u00a0\n(01:33:52) Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food\n(01:34:47) Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability\u00a0\n(01:36:50) ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced Dosage\n(01:39:19) Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency\u00a0\n(01:42:56) Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine\n(01:44:50) Tool: Other Supplements to Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine\u00a0\n(01:46:46) Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools for Focus\n(01:49:12) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Dr. Jarvis\u2019 research spans the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vocal communication, comparative genomics of speech and language across species and the relationship between speech, language and movement. We discuss the unique ability of humans (and certain animal species) to learn and communicate using complex language, including verbal speech production and the ability to interpret both written and spoken language. We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance and why song may have evolved before language. Dr. Jarvis also explains some of the underlying biological and genetic components of stutter/speech disorders, non-verbal communication, why it's easiest to learn a language as a child and how individuals can learn multiple languages at any age.

We discuss how best to evaluate your health status using routine blood work, body scans and regular tests of physical strength and endurance. Dr. Attia explains what he uses with his patients to \u201cback-cast\u201d their health goals as a way to design their exercise and nutritional programs. We also discuss hormone modulation and replacement therapy for both men and women. We explain how cholesterol and related factors contribute to cardiovascular disease risk and how to monitor and mitigate that risk.

Dr. Attia is host of The Drive podcast and is a world expert on behavioral approaches, nutritional interventions, supplementation and pharmacological techniques to improve lifespan, healthspan and athletic performance. We discuss how best to evaluate your health status using routine blood work, body scans and regular tests of physical strength and endurance. Dr. Attia explains what he uses with his patients to \u201cback-cast\u201d their health goals as a way to design their exercise and nutritional programs. We also discuss hormone modulation and replacement therapy for both men and women. We explain how cholesterol and related factors contribute to cardiovascular disease risk and how to monitor and mitigate that risk.

I also describe how these tools can be modified to recover quickly from a poor night\u2019s sleep, jet lag or bouts of shift work. Given that sleep is the foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance, this episode should benefit everyone as it provides an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost strategies that can be tailored to optimize your sleep routine.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Tools to Optimize Sleep\n(00:03:18) Sponsors: LMNT, Eight Sleep\n(00:08:24) Factors to Control Circadian Rhythm & Sleep\n(00:15:10) Morning Tool: Morning Sunlight Viewing, Cortisol\n(00:20:44) Morning Sunlight: Circadian Rhythm, Artificial Lights, Cloudy Days\n(00:26:18) Evaluating Light in Environment, Compensating for Missed Morning Light\n(00:29:01) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:30:46) Morning Tools: Temperature & Deliberate Cold Exposure, Exercise\n(00:34:58) Timing Caffeine, \u201cAfternoon Crash,\u201d Exercise\n(00:40:08) Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm\n(00:45:20) 3 Daily Critical Periods\n(00:46:49) Afternoons: Naps, Deep Relaxation (NSDR, Self-Hypnosis), Exercise & Body Temperature, Caffeine\n(00:51:59) Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight in Late Afternoon, Evening Light\n(00:56:45) Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity\n(01:04:40) Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment\n(01:09:40) Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep\n(01:11:45) Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine\n(01:16:34) Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)\n(01:17:44) Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety\n(01:20:08) Falling Back Asleep: Reveri App, NSDR, Yoga Nidra\n(01:22:55) Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet\n(01:24:58) Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing\n(01:28:20) Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine\n(01:31:14) Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights\n(01:37:38) Behavioral Tools for 3 Daily Critical Periods\n(01:39:26) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Huberman Lab Clips, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.\u2019 I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation.

Dr. Zuker is the world\u2019s leading expert in the biology of taste, thirst and craving. His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste,\u00a0the \u201cgut-brain axis,\u201d the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, to our emotions, and expectation. We also consider how sugar containing and highly-processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems.

This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n(00:04:06) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:28) What is OCD and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder?\n(00:11:18) OCD: Major Incidence & Severity\n(00:15:10) Categories of OCD\n(00:21:33) Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions\n(00:27:33) OCD & Familial Heredity\n(00:29:10) Biological Mechanisms of OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops\n(00:39:36) Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loop & OCD\n(00:46:39) Clinical OCD Diagnosis, Y-BOCS Index\n(00:51:38) OCD & Fear, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) & Exposure Therapy\n(01:01:56) Unique Characteristics of CBT/Exposure Therapy in OCD Treatment\n(01:10:18) CBT/Exposure Therapy & Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)\n(01:22:30) Considerations with SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments\n(01:25:17) Serotonin & Cognitive Flexibility, Psilocybin Studies\n(01:31:50) Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators\n(01:36:09) OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD\n(01:39:29) Ketamine Treatment\n(01:41:43) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\n(01:46:22) Cannabis CBD & Focus\n(01:47:50) Thoughts Are Not Actions\n(01:51:27) Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA\n(02:00:55) Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD\n(02:03:28) Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine\n(02:09:45) OCD vs. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder\n(02:20:53) Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions\n(02:31:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

As one of the most sought out teachers of movement alive today, the knowledge Ido shares in this conversation can benefit everyone\u2014children, adults, athletes, dancers, clinicians and trainers and the everyday person.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Ido Portal, Movement & Movement Practice\n(00:03:42) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:07:49) What is Movement?\n(00:10:56) Movement & the Body-Mind Connection\n(00:14:47) Entry Points to Movement\n(00:18:08) Early Education in Movement: Awareness, Play & Examination\n(00:21:19) Stillness, Movement & the Environment, Playfulness\n(00:31:34) Unique Postures, Types of Movement, Contents vs. Containers\n(00:40:50) Discomfort: Marker of Movement, Failures & Learning\n(00:47:05) Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution\n(00:56:36) Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change\n(01:02:04) Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution\n(01:12:39) Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement as Language, Consilience\n(01:21:39) Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise\n(01:26:36) Potential for Movement, \u201cHumming\u201d\n(01:32:18) Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees of Freedom\n(01:35:50) Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity\n(01:38:06) Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness\n(01:48:28) Hearing & Movement\n(01:52:43) Walking Gaits\n(01:56:55) Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness\n(02:03:05) Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity to Others, Play & Discomfort\n(02:18:13) Visualization & Experience, Feedback\n(02:20:14) Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination\n(02:31:45) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and \u201cmicro-stretching\u201d protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment.

All people, physically active or not, should benefit from the information and tools described in this episode.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Flexibility & Stretching\n(00:02:57) Sponsors: AG1, InsideTracker\n(00:07:22) Innate Flexibility\n(00:09:23) Movement: Nervous System, Connective Tissue & Muscle; Range of Motion\n(00:17:51) Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) & Load Sensing Mechanisms\n(00:20:20) Decreased Flexibility & Aging\n(00:22:38) Insula, Body Discomfort & Choice\n(00:30:02) von Economo Neurons, Parasympathetic Activation & Relaxation\n(00:42:00) Muscle Anatomy & Cellular \u2018Lengthening,\u2019 Range of Motion\n(00:47:16) Tool: Protocol - Antagonistic Muscles, Pushing vs. Pulling Exercises\n(00:51:57) Types of Stretching: Dynamic, Ballistic, Static & PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation)\n(00:59:36) Tool: Increasing Range of Motion, Static Stretching Protocol, Duration\n(01:05:56) Tool: Static Stretching Protocol & Frequency\n(01:13:55) Tool: Effective Stretching Protocol\n(01:17:12) Tool: Warming Up & Stretching\n(01:19:17) Limb Range of Motion & General Health Benefits\n(01:25:30) PNF Stretching, Golgi Tendon Organs & Autogenic Inhibition\n(01:31:23) Tool: Anderson Protocol & End Range of Motion, Feeling the Stretch\n(01:32:50) Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, \u201cMicro-Stretching\u201d\n(01:41:33) Tool: Should you Stretch Before or After Other Exercises?\n(01:45:41) Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease\n(01:51:37) Insula & Discomfort, Pain Tolerance & Yoga\n(02:00:36) Tools: Summary of Stretching Protocols\n(02:03:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives.\nWe recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States.

I also explore how salt interacts with stress and our immune systems and its crucial role in neuron function. Additionally, I examine research findings suggesting that some individuals might benefit from increased intake of sodium and other electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) to enhance mental performance, lessen anxiety, and offset dizziness.

Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed findings outlining salt\u2019s essential role in overall health and describe general recommendations and tools anyone can use to find their optimal salt balance and thereby enhance their brain and body\u2019s performance.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Role of Salt\u00a0\n(00:02:57) Neuropod Cells, Artificial Sweeteners & \u2018Hidden\u2019 Cravings\u00a0\n(00:10:36) Sponsors: AG1, Thesis\n(00:15:06) Salt Regulation\u00a0\n(00:17:13) How the Brain Senses Salt\n(00:24:15) Salt & Thirst\u00a0\n(00:29:27) Blood Pressure & Thirst\u00a0\n(00:33:47) Kidneys & Urine Regulation\n(00:39:08) Vasopressin: Roles in Libido & Urination\u00a0\n(00:45:46) How Much Salt Do You Need?\u00a0\n(00:56:45) Should You Increase Your Salt Intake?\u00a0\n(01:02:19) Tools: Determining Your Individual Salt Intake\n(01:14:02) Iodine, Sea Salt\u00a0\n(01:17:13) Salt: Roles in Stress & Anxiety\u00a0\n(01:24:20) Other Electrolytes: Magnesium & Potassium\u00a0\n(01:27:57) Tools: Effects of Low-carbohydrate Diets & Caffeine\u00a0\n(01:32:28) General Recommendations for Salt Intake\u00a0\n(01:36:34) Perception of Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods\u00a0\n(01:47:13) Role of Sodium in Neuronal Function, Action Potentials\u00a0\n(01:53:13) Dehydration\u00a0\n(01:55:36) What Salt Intake is Best for You?\u00a0\n(02:00:58) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\u00a0\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

Dr. Sonnenburg\u2019s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome.

Dr. Spiegel has more than 40 years of clinical and research experience with hypnosis, stress physiology, and psychotherapy. In this episode, we examine the role of clinical hypnosis for the treatment of trauma, chronic pain, anxiety and more. Dr. Spiegel explains how to determine your level of \u2018hypnotizability\u2019 and provides case studies of incredible successes with hypnosis to treat a variety of ailments. We also discuss how breathing, vision and directed mental focus can modulate internal states and enhance performance. Additionally, we discuss how the adoption of self-hypnosis techniques can reduce stress and enhance sleep in anyone. Dr. Spiegel teaches us how hypnosis works at the neural circuit level to enhance cognitive flexibility. Throughout\u00a0the episode, Dr. Spiegel summarizes key clinical trials and peer-reviewed findings and resources to work with a trained clinical professional or to do guided self-hypnosis.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. David Spiegel MD, Hypnosis\n(00:04:20) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:09:09) Clinical Hypnosis\n(00:16:45) Stage Hypnosis\n(00:20:25) Neurobiology of Hypnosis\n(00:26:04) ADHD\n(00:28:22) Hypnosis for Stress & Sleep\n(00:32:12) Hypnosis to Strengthen Neural Connections\n(00:37:19) Restructuring Trauma Narratives\n(00:45:14) Ketamine Therapy\n(00:50:07) Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri\n(00:56:53) Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions\n(01:01:50) \u2018Hypnotizability\u2019, the Spiegel Eye-roll Test\n(01:15:36) EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)\n(01:21:43) Confronting Stress & Trauma\n(01:27:56) The Mind-Body Connection\n(01:31:35) Dealing with Grief\n(01:35:45) Hypnosis in Children & Groups\n(01:40:06) Drug Therapies & Hypnosis\n(01:42:39) Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance\n(01:50:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Throughout the episode, I use the science of play to outline recommendations for using play as a means to enhance neuroplasticity and explore novel situations, regardless of age.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) The Power of Play\n(00:02:23) Tool: Reading on Smart Phones, Sighing & Learning\n(00:09:33) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:13:57) Homeostatic Regulation of Play\n(00:23:53) Childhood Play & Mindsets\n(00:29:21) Contingency Testing\n(00:32:17) The (Power of) Playful Mindset\n(00:36:13) Body Postures\n(00:44:03) Rule Testing & Breaking\n(00:48:24) Role Play\n(00:50:39) Neurobiology of Low-stakes Play\n(00:54:22) Expanding Capabilities through Tinkering\n(01:00:03) Play Is THE Portal to Neuroplasticity\n(01:04:44) Adulthood Play\n(01:10:14) Fire Together, Wire Together\n(01:18:03) Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery\n(01:23:25) Competition & Dynamic Movement\n(01:27:36) Chess, Mental Roles, Novelty\n(01:32:52) Personal Play Identity\n(01:37:24) Play Transforms Your Future Self\n(01:40:55) Recommendations for Play\n(01:44:25) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify/Apple Reviews, YouTube, Sponsors, Instagram, Twitter, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

Dr. Crum is a world expert on mindsets and beliefs and how they shape our responses to stress, exercise, and even to the foods we eat. We discuss how our mindset about the nutritional content of food changes whether it is satisfying to us at a physiological (hormonal and metabolic) level.

Dr. Crum teaches us how to think about stress in ways that allow stress to grow us and bring out our best rather than diminish our health and performance.

We discuss physiological sighs, peptides expressed by specific neurons controlling breathing, and magnesium compounds that can improve cognitive ability and how they work. This conversation serves as a sort of \"Master Class\" on the science of breathing and breathing-related tools for health and performance.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nOur Breath Collective\nhttps://www.ourbreathcollective.com/huberman\u00a0\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introducing Dr. Jack Feldman\n(00:03:20) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:10:35) Why We Breathe\u00a0\n(00:14:35) Neural Control of Breathing: \u201cPre-Botzinger Complex\u201d\n(00:16:20) Nose vs Mouth Breathing\n(00:18:18) Skeletal vs. Smooth Muscles: Diaphragm, Intracostals & Airway Muscles\n(00:20:11) Two Breathing Oscillators: Pre-Botzinger Complex & Parafacial Nucleus\n(00:26:20) How We Breathe Is Special (Compared to Non-Mammals)\n(00:33:40) Stomach & Chest Movements During Breathing\n(00:36:23) Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin\n(00:49:39) If We Don\u2019t Sigh, Our Lung (& General) Health Suffers\n(01:00:42) Breathing, Brain States & Emotions\u00a0\n(01:05:34) Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear\u00a0\n(01:11:00) Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing\n(01:16:25) Facial Expressions\n(01:19:00) Locus Coeruleus & Alertness\n(01:29:40) Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia\n(01:35:22) Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI\n(01:38:08) Cyclic Hyperventilation\n(01:39:50) Hyperbaric Chambers\n(01:40:41) Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril\n(01:44:50) Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.\n(01:57:13) Dr. Feldman\u2019s Breathwork Protocols, Post-Lunch\u00a0\n(02:02:05) Deliberately Variable Breathwork: The Feldman Protocol\n(02:06:29) Magnesium Threonate & Cognition & Memory\u00a0\n(02:18:27) Gratitude for Dr. Feldman\u2019s Highly Impactful Work\n(02:20:53) Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Instagram, Twitter, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

            "content": "In this episode, I discuss fear and trauma, including the neural circuits involved in the \"threat reflex\" and how specific experiences and memories come to activate that system. I also discuss how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, I describe the logic of fear mechanisms and how \"top-down\" processing-- meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then I discuss what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and consider various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine, other drug-assisted therapies, and more.

I review the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. I also discuss circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. I explain the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And I cover the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity.

                "summary": "In this episode, I discuss how our brain and body track time and the role that neurochemicals, in particular dopamine and serotonin, but also hormones such as melatonin, allow us to orient ourselves in time. I review the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. I also discuss circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. I explain the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And I cover the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity. I include ten tools based on the science of time perception that you can apply to enhance productivity, creativity, and relationships in various contexts.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introducing Time Perception, Note on Fasting & Supplements\n(00:05:28) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:09:25) Entrainment, Circannual Entrainment, Melatonin\n(00:13:20) Seasonal Oscillations in Testosterone & Estrogen, Tool 1\n(00:16:06) Circadian Timing, Tools 1, 2, 3 (for Circadian Entrainment)\n(00:21:13) Tool 4: Timing Physical Activity; Tool 5: Timing Eating Window\n(00:23:00) When Circadian Entrainment is Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers\n(00:25:00) Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus\n(00:31:42) Our Sense of the Passage of Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective\n(00:34:40) Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead to Time Overestimation; Frame Rate\u00a0\n(00:37:18) Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate\n(00:39:10) Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across the Day; Tool 7: When to Do Rigid vs. Creative Work\n(00:42:38) Example of Tool 7\n(00:43:38) How Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance\n(00:44:38) Trauma, \u201cOver-clocking\u201d & Memories; Adjusting Rates of Experience\n(00:50:04) Why Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal\n(00:51:03) Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8\n(00:53:38) Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate in Discomfort\n(00:56:30) Fun \u201cFeels Fast\u201d BUT Is Remembered as Slow; Boring Stuff \u201cFeels Slow,\u201d Recall As Fast\n(01:00:54) Retrospective Time, Context Variation & Enhanced Bonding with Places & People\n(01:03:00) Dopamine Release Resets the Start of Each Time Bin on Our Experience\n(01:07:40) Habits & Time Perception; Tool 10 (Setting Functional Units of Each Day)\n(01:11:58) Synthesis & Book Suggestion (Your Brain Is a Time Machine by D.

I discuss how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system.\nI discuss the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes-- not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And I review how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. I discuss how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and, if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. I also discuss the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and I discuss how to increase glymphatic \"washout\" of brain debris during sleep.

I also review fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation).\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) The Mind & Immune System, New Findings: Acupuncture & Fascia\n(00:03:16) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:07:41) Foundational Tools & Practices for a Healthy Immune System\n(00:11:20) Immune System Basics: Skin/Mucous, Innate & Adaptive Immune System\n(00:17:08) Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (\u201cEat Me!\u201d Signals), Cytokines (\u201cHelp Me!\u201d Signals)\n(00:21:06) The Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies\n(00:28:00) Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome and \u201cScrubbing\u201d Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing\n(00:30:33) Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Your Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods\n(00:34:20) Some Interleukins Are Anti-Inflammatory\n(00:34:56) Sickness Behavior\n(00:39:08) Some People Seek Care When Sick, Others Want to be Alone\n(00:42:00) Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines\n(00:43:40) Reduced Appetites When Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido\n(00:46:45) Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness\n(00:53:03) Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Your Brain State\n(00:55:04) Tools 4, 5: Reducing Sickness: Glymphatic Clearance, Pre-Sleep Serotonin, 5HTP\n(01:07:03) Tool 6: Hot Showers, Saunas, Baths & Cortisol, Heath-Cold Contrast\n(01:10:53) Feed a Fever & Starve a Cold (?), Adrenaline\n(01:12:36) Tool 7: Activating Your Immune System w/Cyclic-Hyperventilation, Alkalinity\n(01:29:10) Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine\n(01:32:10) Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, You Can Worry Yourself Sick\n(01:37:00) Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold Exposure\n(01:42:05) Once You\u2019re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis\n(01:46:09) Histamines, Mast Cells\n(01:49:22) Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism for How It Reduces Inflammation; Fascia, Rolfing\u00a0\n(01:53:40) Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices\n(01:58:00) Synthesis, Ways to Support Us (Zero-Cost), Sponsors, Supplements, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days.

                "summary": "In this episode, I host Dr. Samer Hattar, Chief of the Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms at the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days. And he offers precise tools to rapidly adjust to jetlag, shift work, and reset your clock after a late night of work or socializing.

I also review data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline.

Amazingly, it's not just about what tastes good to us. Next, I explore how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. I also review new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental,\u00a0in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation.

We discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how most everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run further and faster, as well as to eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance, and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and to enhance sleep and cognition. We discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs!

Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance, and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and to enhance sleep and cognition. We discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs!

I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine\u2014both their benefits and risks\u2014and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction & Tool 1 to Induce Lasting Dopamine\n(00:05:04) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:09:10) Upcoming (Zero-Cost) Neuroplasticity Seminar for Educators\n(00:09:58) What Dopamine (Really) Does\n(00:15:30) Two Main Neural Circuits for Dopamine\u00a0\n(00:18:14) How Dopamine Is Released: Locally and Broadly\n(00:22:03) Fast and Slow Effects of Dopamine\n(00:25:03) Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate\n(00:28:00) Your Dopamine History Really Matters\u00a0\n(00:30:30) Parkinson\u2019s & Drugs That Kill Dopamine Neurons.

I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional \"blinks\" (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD).\nThe role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed.

            "content": "In this episode, I discuss what drives hunger and satiety, and the role our brain, stomach, fat and hormones play in regulating hunger and turning off the desire to eat more. I also address how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day, and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day.\nThen I delve into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa where people binge and purge their food. I discuss some common myths about Anorexia such as the role of media images increasing the rates of anorexia and the myth of the \"perfectionist\" anorexic. I also review the symptoms, and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. I explain how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then I discuss the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices.

We discuss stress, what defines short-term versus long-term stress, and how stress can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context. We also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress mitigation techniques, including exercise, determine health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone \u2014 how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior, but that it does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence, and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He also explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. And we discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity. Finally, we discuss free will, what it means to have free will, and if we have any free will, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction: Dr. Robert Sapolsky\u00a0\n(00:02:25) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:06:30) Stress: Short & Long-Term, Good & Bad\u00a0\n(00:09:11) Valence & Amygdala\u00a0\n(00:11:00) Testosterone: Common Myths vs. Actual Truths\u00a0\n(00:15:15) Behaviors that Affect Testosterone\u00a0\u00a0\n(00:17:20) Mindsets & Contexts that Affect Testosterone\n(00:20:28) How Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels\u00a0\u00a0\n(00:22:30) Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female\u00a0\n(00:24:05) Testosterone: The Challenge Hypothesis\u00a0\n(00:29:20) How Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation\u00a0\n(00:32:32) Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity BUT TIMING IS KEY\u00a0\n(00:39:40) Are Testosterone & Sperm Counts in Males Really Dropping?\u00a0\n(00:42:15) Stress Mitigation & Our Sense of Control\u00a0\n(00:51:35) How Best to Buffer Stress\u00a0\n(00:57:04) Power of Perception, Choice & Individual Differences\u00a0\n(01:00:32) Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy\u00a0\n(01:11:20) How Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking\u00a0\u00a0\n(01:13:17) Do We Have Free Will?\u00a0\n(01:20:50) How to Apply Knowledge & Learning\u00a0\u00a0\n(01:23:44) Robert\u2019s New Book: \u201cDetermined: The Science of Life Without Free Will\u201d\u00a0\n(01:28:27) Reflections, Support of Podcast, & Supporting Stress Research\u00a0\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I explain the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms.

We also discuss the science and practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke also shares her expertise on topics closely related to addiction such as community, shame and lying and she explains why telling the truth\u2014even about the most basic things in daily life, adjusts dopamine levels in our brain.\nThis episode is an important one for anyone struggling with addictions of any kind, for their friends and families and for health care professionals. It is also for anyone who has defeated addiction and is determined to stay clean.

I also discuss whole body pain, pain \"syndromes\" and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine.

I describe 11 science-supported protocols for enhancing brain-body health and the logic behind them.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Your Sense of Self: Interoception\n(00:01:25) Protocol 1: Fermented Foods, Not Fiber, to Reduce Inflammation\u00a0\n(00:03:45) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:22) Main Drivers of Feelings & Performance\n(00:11:45) Brain-Body: A Mechanical & Chemical Dialogue\u00a0\n(00:17:50) LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue\u00a0\u00a0\n(00:21:00) Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate With Breathing\n(00:29:08) Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors\n(00:30:54) Carbon Dioxide, From Air to Blood\n(00:34:02) Protocol 5: Alert While Calm\n(00:40:50) Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex\n(00:42:47) Gut Volume & The Desire to Open Your Mouth\u00a0\n(00:48:18) Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting\u00a0\n(00:51:50) Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar\n(00:57:00) Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings with Specific Amino Acid Nutrients\u00a0\n(00:58:58) Gut Acidity (Is Good)\n(01:02:20) Improving Nasal Microbiome\u00a0\n(01:04:13) Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented\u00a0\n(01:11:15) Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented Foods\n(01:13:10) Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine\n(01:15:50) Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin\n(01:18:30) Probiotics & Brain Fog\n(01:21:45) Nausea: Happens in Your Brain; Area Postrema\n(01:28:25) Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.\n(01:30:40) Fever: Triggers and Control Knobs: OVLT\n(01:37:00) Protocol 10: Cooling the Blood Properly\n(01:38:53) Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress\n(01:41:50) Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions\n(01:45:00) Sensing Other People\u2019s Emotions via the Body\n(01:46:00) Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat\u00a0\n(01:50:40) Conclusions & Resources\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

                "summary": "This episode explains how we sense chemicals through smell, taste, and pheromones. How things smell and taste and chemicals in the tears, breath, and on the skin of others have a profound effect on how we feel, what we do, and our hormones. I explain the 3 types of responses to smell, the 5 types of tastes, the possible existence of sixth taste sense, and how the act of sniffing can make us learn and focus better. I explain how smell and taste reflect brain health and can assess and even promote brain regeneration. I discuss how eating specific categories of foods makes us crave more of those foods, including how to make sour things taste sweet and develop a heightened sense of smell and taste.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes and timestamps, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

I also describe what to do immediately after a training session (note: this is different than the optimal protocol for cognitive skill training) and as you progress to more advanced levels of performance. I also cover the science of skill-based visualization which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. I discuss auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training \u2018deliberately idle\u2019 sessions.

I describe the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous-- and the better alternatives.

                "summary": "This episode discusses metabolism and how our thyroid hormone and growth hormone control our metabolism. I also clarify that metabolism isn't just about burning energy, it\u2019s about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. I also describe the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides and other factors for changing levels of thyroid and growth hormone, and some of their risks. Throughout the episode, mechanisms and tools grounded in specific mechanisms are discussed.\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:06:05) Thyroid & Growth Hormone\n(00:08:44) Food Shapes: Do They Matter?\n(00:11:43) Stevia: Naming & Impact\n(00:13:30) Metabolism 101: Your Brain the Furnace\n(00:17:33) Releasing Hormones From Your Brain, Stimulating Hormones from Your Pituitary\n(00:21:04) Thyroid Hormone\u2019s Real Effects: Growth, Repair and Energy Consumption of Tissues\n(00:22:45) Iodine, L-Tyrosine & Selenium: The Trio Essential For Thyroid Function\n(00:26:05) How Much Iodine Do We Need?

I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels.

                "summary": "This episode I discuss how hormones from our gut, liver, pancreas and brain control our appetite--and the specific tools we can use to adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering release of the hormone CCK, and more.\nNote: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I mis-spoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said \u201cP-M-O-C\u201d but should have said \u201cPOMC\u201d. Apologies. The name I gave for what POMC is, however, was correct: \"proopiomelanocortin\".\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:06:59) Hunger: Neural & Hormonal Control\n(00:08:32) Chewing & Hunger\n(00:11:05) Siamese Rats Reveal the Importance of Hormones In Hunger\n(00:13:08) Neurons That Powerfully Control Hunger by Releasing Specific Hormones\n(00:16:28) Anorexia & Extreme Overeating\n(00:16:57) Why Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -MSH)\n(00:20:03) Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan & Priapism\n(00:22:30) Ghrelin: A Hormone That Determines When You Get Hungry, & That You Can Control\n(00:24:40) Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not the Other Way Around\n(00:27:20) Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting\n(00:29:35) How To Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: The 45min Per Day Rule\n(00:33:02) CCK (Cholecystokinin): A Hormone In Your Gut That Says \u201cNo Mas!\u201d\n(00:34:55) Eating For Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar\n(00:39:05) L-Glutamine: Stimulates the Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings\n(00:43:42) Things To Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing\n(00:49:32) \u201cA Calorie Is NOT A Calorie\u201d After All\n(00:52:36) Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia\n(00:56:12) The Order Your Eat Foods Matters: Managing Your Blood Glucose & Glucagon\n(01:02:40) Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4\n(01:04:50) Why Sugar Stimulates Your Appetite\n(01:05:40) Keeping Blood Sugar Stable With Specific Exercises, The Power Of Insulin Sensitivity\n(01:07:55) High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism\n(01:10:28) Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver, Adrenals\n(01:15:00) Prescription Compounds That Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin\n(01:16:45) Berberine: A Potent Glucose Buffer That Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels, Canker Sores\n(01:22:05) Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, & Zinc\n(01:24:34) Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity\n(01:26:40) Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects On Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones\n(01:28:10) Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine\n(01:31:08) The Power of GLP-1 & Yerba Mate For Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes\n(01:35:19) Summary & Notes About Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone\n(01:37:20) Zero Cost & Sponsor-Based Ways To Support The Huberman Lab Podcast"

I frame this in the context of our daily 24-hour cycle in order to make it practical, clear and precise about timing. I review the role of fasting, meal timing and specific types of nutrients for promoting certain states of mind.
