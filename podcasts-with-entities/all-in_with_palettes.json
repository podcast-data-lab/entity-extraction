What\u2019s the balance between giving your child room to use his or her agency while showing your love for them? In this week\u2019s All In episode, parenting guru Justin Coulson explains how the Savior\u2019s teachings about love, compassion, and mourning with those that mourn apply to the family. Whether we\u2019re a parent or not, we can all learn from the Savior\u2019s example of how to \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto me\u201d (Mark 10:14).\n\r\n\u201cSometimes in our angry moments, or in our tired moments, or, let\u2019s be honest, in our selfish moments, we might be less loving than we could be towards our children. Sometimes we feel inclined to hurt rather than to help, or...we\u2019re neutral or ambivalent, or we shrug our shoulders and say \u2018Whatever\u2019. But He doesn't.

And for years, Liz dreamed of a home that was like theirs\u2014not because of the decor, but because of the families within those walls.

Wherever you are on this spectrum,\u00a0on this week's episode,\u00a0Katie Hughes,\u00a0co-author of \"The Gathering Home,\" shares practical\u00a0tips and much-needed perspective on how to\u00a0make any gathering special.\u00a0So as we head into this Christmas season with all of its hustle and bustle, may we invite you to take a few minutes to join us in considering ways to remember that He is the reason for the season.\n\r\n2:51- The Magic of the Holidays\n\r\n5:32- Connection Over Perfection\n\r\n9:05- Planning- The Key to Eliminating Stress\n\r\n11:23- Thanksgiving\n\r\n14:10- Christmas Advent\n\r\n18:34- Light The World\n\r\n23:51- Traditions Past and Present\n\r\n33:32- Christmas Music\n\r\n37:25- Peace, Calm, and Stillness\n\r\n43:23- What Does It Mean To Be All In the Gospel of Jesus Christ?\u00a0\n\r\n\u00a0\n\r\n\"If you think about that star that you're cutting out of your cookie dough or hanging on your tree, all these commercial-type parts of Christmas, if they're not leading us to Jesus in some way\u2014leading us to Bethlehem in some way\u2014then it's a Christmas without Christ.\u201d\n\r\nEpisode references:\n\r\nThe Gather Home Book\n\r\nArticle about The Gathering Home with quote from Emily Belle Freeman about Katie\u00a0\n\r\nJames E. Faust quote-\n\r\n\"No one can measure the effect of an unselfish act of kindness. By small, simple things great things do indeed come to pass. Of course gifts given and gifts received make Christmas special. For many children Christmas Eve is a very long night as they look forward with eager anticipation to the gifts Santa brings, which is why children love Santa Claus. Let me share what someone once said about Santa Claus: First of all, he's a joyous individual.\n\r\nPeople are attracted to joyous individuals as filings are attracted to a magnet. Next, Santa Claus is interested in making others happy. He increases the happy moments in the life of everyone he meets. He loves his work; he gets fun out of his job. He is childlike, simple, humble, sincere, and forgiving. Finally, he is a giver. His philosophy is to give himself away in service. He is a friend to everyone. He smiles. Perhaps you and I could attain greater happiness if we emulated Santa Claus a little more, for his way is the way of the Infant Jesus also.\u201d\n\r\nJames E Faust The Man Who Would Be Santa.

Having Porter on the football field and coaching I knew was so important for an entire community who doesn't get represented in professional sports.\"\n\r\n\n02:38- Lifetime Chiefs Fan or No?\n\r\n3:50- The Accident and Amputation\n\r\n7:19- Adapting\n\r\n9:18- What They See When They Stare\n\r\n13:14- The New Era\n18:04- A Dreamer and a Planner\n\r\n23:38- A Call From Andy Reid\n\r\n29:56- A Team At Home\n\r\n40:30- Lessons from Coach Reid\n\r\n48:14- What Does It Mean To Be All In the Gospel of Jesus Christ?\u00a0\n\r\n\nLinks-\n\r\nhttps://www.sltrib.com/sports/2021/02/04/gordon-monson-meet-utahs/\nVideos of Porter-\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/CarlieMcKeon\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2008/02/face-trials-with-smiles?lang=eng\nhttps://magazine.byu.edu/article/left-hand-man/\nPresident Nelson biography-\u00a0https://deseretbook.com/p/insights-from-a-prophets-life-russell-m-nelson-by-sheri-dew?queryID=c106d5b6a9f400314814268d9057769d&variant_id=172666-hardcover\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

But Judge Thomas B. Griffith, who was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals in 2005, is a believer that it is possible and the \"how\" is found within the gospel of Jesus Christ. In this week's episode, Judge Griffith discusses how to bring that gospel perspective as we engage in our communities.\n\r\n\"Our political allegiances need to be way down the list in terms of importance. Our allegiance to the Savior and His work needs to be at the top of the list.\"\n\r\nShow Notes:\u00a0\n\r\n2:35- Conversion in High School\n9:37- Called to Engage\n13:27- Moderate and Unify\n17:04- The Divine Community and Laboratory of Christian Living\n20:58- Christ in All Things\n30:00- Building Zion\n36:32- Bipartisanship\n41:15- Media Literacy\n48:21- A Society Where Creativity is Unleashed\n52:34- What Does It Mean To Be All In the Gospel of Jesus Christ?\n\r\nFind the full episode transcript at ldsliving.com/allin.\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

Sadly, I worry that I took a lot more than I probably ever gave because it blessed my life in so many ways.\"\n\r\nShow Notes\n\r\n1:17- A Giant Bean Bag\n10:42- A Mission in Mandarin\n15:04- Everything Else is Dust\n19:34- Highs and Lows\n24:43- Sharing the Gospel Through YouTube\n30:45- Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs\n36:40- What Does It Mean To Be \u201cAll In\u201d the Gospel of Jesus Christ?\n\r\nFind the full episode transcript at ldsliving.com/allin.\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

Please excuse any reference to &ldquo;Mormonism&rdquo; as a result.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is one of the reasons why God restored the Church in the modern age, because he knew precisely the ways that our social bonds would erode in the 20th and 21st centuries, and the Church is one of the great answers for that. So is it hard sometimes? Yeah, but I think one of the great aspects of the restoration is the we&rsquo;re put in wards that are geographically defined, we do not choose who we go to church with.

We take things to heart that we have no business taking to heart. For instance, saying &ldquo;If you loved me you wouldn&rsquo;t drink&rdquo; to an alcoholic makes as much sense as saying &ldquo;If you loved me, you wouldn&rsquo;t cough&rdquo; to someone who has pneumonia. Pneumonia victims will cough until they get appropriate treatment for their illness. Alcoholics will drink until they get the same. When people with a compulsive disorder do whatever it is they are compelled to do, they are not saying they don&rsquo;t love you&mdash;they are saying they don&rsquo;t love themselves.&rdquo;-Melody Beattie in \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Codependent-No-More-Controlling-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00BS027FC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=39IACS9ASHEHS&amp;keywords=codependent+no+more&amp;qid=1563225432&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=Codepend%2Cdigital-text%2C170&amp;sr=1-3\">Codependent No More</a>\"</p>\r\n<p>Visit the Church's <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/addressing-pornography/?lang=eng\">\"Addressing Pornography\"</a> website.</p>\r\n<p>\"We need to be more patient with the process. We need to worry less about the speed at which we are moving and more about the direction we are going. We will not fully realize our divine potential in this life. And while we need to make wise use of our time in our mortal existence, we should remember that God does not deal with time in the same way we do. In fact, time as we understand it may not bind Him at all. As Alma noted, 'Time only is measured unto men.' Because speed is a measure of distance over time, if time becomes less relevant, so does speed. Thus, in eternal things, such as our ongoing progress in becoming like God, direction is more important than speed. In the long run, the direction we are headed matters much more than the rate at which we are moving.\" Kevin Worthen, \"<a href=\"https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/kevin-j-worthen/knowing-who-you-are/\">Knowing Who You Are.</a>\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Read Elder Jeffrey R.
