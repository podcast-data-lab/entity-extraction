It seems like nearly every major tech company has React in their stack. But why is a framework built specifically for Facebook so popular in the general developer community?</p><p>Josh Collinsworth, Senior Front End Developer at Shopify, wrote an article titled \u201cThe Self-Fulfilling Prophecy of React\u201d. Even though Shopify uses React, Josh didn\u2019t hold back his views on the framework. When React came about, it solved a major problem for Facebook.

The developers behind these projects often juggle full-time jobs to pay their bills while maintaining the software that keeps so much of the internet afloat.</p><p>Max Howell, CEO of tea.inc., pivoted from chemistry to web development because of his fascination for open source. He worked full-time and did pull requests for Homebrew during his free time. After hustling to build a package manager used by engineers working for corporate giants like Google and Microsoft, he reached an inevitable burnout.

If you were browsing the web in the 90s, you were likely visiting a multi-page app. Lucky for us, web tech improved, and made the entire experience of multi-page apps more appealing.</p><p>One of the cons of MPAs is that they don\u2019t have preload and prefetch out of the box. Single-page apps (SPAs) on the other hand give you the power to decide how your site loads by loading all the resources for your current page and fetching resources for a page you might navigate to after. This might seem small but it makes a huge impact on your site.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is, more computing power gave way to better server-rendered technology, a huge win for multi-page apps.

Two years after Tailwind CSS\u2019s launch, Adam released Headless UI to bring unstyled compatible UI components into the fold. Since then, it\u2019s sparked polarizing discourse between developers who either love it or hate it.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Chuck and Robbie talk to Adam about what motivated him to create Tailwind CSS, how Headless UI was born, why Tailwind is creating polarizing discourse among developers, and his powerlifting past.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p><ul>\n<li>[00:35] - An introduction to Adam Wathan.</li>\n<li>[01:55] - A whiskey review - W3WC Sagamore Rye Barrel Pick #001.</li>\n<li>[06:51] - Adam explains Tailwind CSS.</li>\n<li>[09:47] - The problems that inspired Adam to create Tailwind.</li>\n<li>[35:24] - How Headless UI fits into Tailwind.</li>\n<li>[41:09] - Whether Tailwind will support other frameworks in the future.</li>\n<li>[44:33] - Adam\u2019s powerlifting career.</li>\n</ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Quotes</strong></p><p>[16:47] - \u201cI started noticing that the only things that really survived every port were the things that were lower and lower level.

If you\u2019re not familiar with the syntax, that could pose a major learning curve. With native apps, it\u2019s tempting to have a separate app for every device that a user might run your app on, but on the operations front, that\u2019s a slippery slope with high overhead costs.

One of the frameworks with the most momentum right now is SolidJS. But what makes Solid so special?</p><p>Dan Jutan, Product Manager at Astro, Inc. and SolidJS core team member believes the frameworks that prioritize developer experience will always come out on top. Before he landed at Solid, Dan started his career using Vue 3.

Who doesn\u2019t want faster rendering?</p><p>Daniel Roe, framework architect at Nuxt Labs has been working to get Nuxt 3 production ready for a stable release. In addition to DX improvements, once N3 is out of release, you can expect hybrid rendering, less JavaScript, and a cross-platform framework that can be used with pretty much any cloud service.</p><p>This Nuxt release is casting a wide net. Daniel and the team wanted the framework to be suited for everyone from hobby bloggers to enterprises. But the biggest win might be for e-commerce sites that need speed, performance, and personalization.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Chuck and Robbie talk to Daniel about the features of Nuxt 3, improving the developer experience, and his family vacation to Algarve, Portugal.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p><ul>\n<li>[00:38] - An introduction to Daniel Roe.</li>\n<li>[03:29] - A whiskey review - Laphroig Lore.</li>\n<li>[11:20] - The new features in Nuxt 3.</li>\n<li>[19:16] - The best path to convert projects to Nuxt 3.</li>\n<li>[32:47] - The target audience for Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3.</li>\n<li>[45:31] - Daniel\u2019s holiday in Portugal .</li>\n<li>[51:49] - David\u2019s side project in Magic Regexp.</li>\n</ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Quotes</strong></p><p>[12:21] - \u201cSome of the things that Nuxt 3 brings, well, it's been rewritten from the start, so it's given us an opportunity to do what we really wanted to do with Nuxt. And to learn from some of the mistakes we made for Nuxt 2 and adapt Nuxt for a new world. That sounds a bit crap, but more and more I think we're looking to take advantage of different kinds of hardware for rendering HTML.\u201d ~ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielcroe?lang=en\">@danielcroe</a></p><p>[13:18] - \u201cNuxt 2, out of the box, is a bare minimum package. I did some checking on this. The cold start for the server was 300 milliseconds. With Nuxt 3, it is three milliseconds.\u201d ~ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielcroe?lang=en\">@danielcroe</a></p><p>[38:48] - \u201cI always like using suppliers that win me over because they have the best of whatever it is. They're able to meet my needs. Whether that's experience or price point or whatever it is. But they've won me over. I don't have to stay with them. I'm not forced or coerced into it. I didn't make an early choice, and now I'm reaping the whirlwind and having to pay the price for it. I'm with them because I want to be. That's the best scenario. You have the power to choose.

Astro 1.0 is targeted at devs building content-based websites and is compatible with most frameworks out there.\nIn this episode, Nate talks with Robbie and Chuck about the launch of Astro 1.0, its compatibility with other frameworks, frameworks that inspired Astro, and Nate\u2019s life goal of visiting every national park.\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[00:49] - A quick intro to Nate.\n[01:36] - A whisky review - Laws Centennial Straight Wheat Whiskey 4 Year.\n[09:59] - What is Astro?\n[23:24] - What are the new features in Astro 1.0?\n[30:32] - Web components Nate has used.\n[42:10] - The challenges with monorepos.\n[44:41] - Nate\u2019s life goal of visiting every national park.\n\n\nQuotes\n[12:11] - \u201cI think the ecosystem just goes in circles.

The \"normal\" ones who strive to make their day-to-day lives as easy as possible and the Robbie's of the world who strive to do everything themselves until the last line of code is sealed in a changelog.\u00a0\n\nOn that note, do you prefer conventional commits? Or the tools out there that make organization easier and, sometimes, automated? Chuck and Robbie don't see eye-to-eye on this particular topic so prepare yourself for the mildest smackdown of the century.\n\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie discuss the pros and cons of release-it, the beauty of working system-agnostic, why Robbie prefers the changelog, and an attempt to stay abreast of frameworks like fresh coming into focus.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [00:33] - A whiskey review - Howler Head Banana Whiskey.\n * [09:12] - A mild smackdown on conventional commits versus release-it.\u00a0\n * [15:23] - Why Chuck and Robbie prefer the changelog.\u00a0\n * [20:35] - What is fresh?

                "summary": "In 2017, James C. Davis moved to Charlottesville, Virginia to work at a non-profit tech company that used Ember in their original Saas platform. While James had dabbled in Ember previously, an ask to reimplement the front-end in Ember, this time using TypeScript, proved challenging.\u00a0\n\nAt the time, a few engineers were using TypeScript in Ember, but the open source framework James worked on became the de-facto reference point for projects in Ember types. And the unofficial group of engineers collaborating on the project has become the official Ember TypeScript Core Team.\n\nToday, James works at e-commerce company Salsify with a front-end all in Ember TypeScript. Although setting the standard for using TypeScript in Ember, James believes there's a time and a place for types. Plus, he may have a solution for Robbie's monorepo grievances.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, James talks with Chuck and Robbie about his struggles and triumphs perfecting Ember TypeScript, his real thoughts on monorepos and functional programming, keeping APIs private, and why developing Glint was a type checking necessity.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [01:46] - A whiskey review.\n * [05:48] - Two truths and a lie.\u00a0\n * [12:28] - How James discovered Ember and open source.\u00a0\n * [16:28] - The purpose of the dot ember-cli file.\n * [22:00] - When TypeScript isn't your best bet.\u00a0\n * [22:53] - How the Ember TypeScript core team is handling private API.\n * [25:41] - How James feels about monorepos and functional programming in general.\u00a0\n * [28:57] - What tool James uses to link packages.\n * [31:36] - How James created Glint.\u00a0\n * [39:03] - A camping, travel, and steak-themed whatnot.\u00a0\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[17:58] - \"One of the cool things about the way TypeScript is done now with Babel is we can write stuff in TypeScript and we can use Babel to basically strip out all of the type annotations and just produce JavaScript.\" ~ @jamscdavis [https://twitter.com/jamscdavis]\n\n[19:38] - \"Basically at this point, the only really useful thing that you need inside ember-cli-typescript is its blueprint which is different from the blueprints that generate components and Ember things.\" ~ @jamscdavis [https://twitter.com/jamscdavis]\n\n[21:53] - \"The bigger and more complex your project is, the more that [TypeScript] helps you.\" ~ @jamscdavis [https://twitter.com/jamscdavis]\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n * James on Twitter [https://twitter.com/jamscdavis]\n * GitHub [https://github.com]\n * Twitter [http://www.twitter.com]\n * Elon Musk [https://twitter.com/elonmusk]\n * Starlink [https://www.starlink.com]\n * Ragged Branch Virginia Straight Bourbon (Wheated Bourbon) [https://www.raggedbranch.com]\n * It Might Get Loud [https://www.amazon.com/Might-Get-Loud-Jimmy-Page/dp/B002WNC5BU]\n * Whiskey Web and Whatnot: Bringing Types to Ember with Chris Krycho [https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm/bringing-types-to-ember-with-chris-krycho/]\n * Chris Krycho\u00a0 [https://twitter.com/chriskrycho]\n * Ember TypeScript Core Team [https://blog.emberjs.com/typed-ember-is-now-the-ember-type-script-core-team/]\n * Center for Open Science [https://www.cos.io]\n * The Open Science Framework [https://www.cos.io/products/osf]\n * Ember.js [https://emberjs.com]\n * TypeScript [https://www.typescriptlang.org]\n * ember-cli-typescript [https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript]\n * Salsify\u00a0 [https://www.salsify.com]\n * Dan Freeman [https://twitter.com/__dfreeman]\n * Babel [https://babeljs.io]"

His primary goal became solving semantic versioning for TS. As Chris kept iterating, striving to combine multiple programming worlds, other engineers joined him in the pursuit until eventually, the Ember TypeScript Core team was born.\u00a0\n\nToday, Chris is a lead engineer at LinkedIn, a father, husband, runner, music composer, and whiskey enthusiast. His current goal is to ensure Ember Polaris has first-class TypeScript support. Aside from offering new dad advice to Robbie, Chris also describes what can become a superpower for new developers willing to work.\n\nIn this episode, Chris talks with Chuck and Robbie about best-case uses for TypeScript, a defense of complicated library code, Chris' ultimate goal with software engineering, and his advice for programmers on the rise.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [01:10] - A brief intro to Chris.\u00a0\n * [02:26] - A whiskey review.\u00a0\n * [10:57] - How the Ember TypeScript Core Team originated.\u00a0\n * [19:11] - When Chris believes TypeScript isn't necessary.\u00a0\n * [26:52] - Chris' lengthy experience with programming languages.\u00a0\n * [28:39] - Chris' advice to Robbie as a new father.\u00a0\n * [30:59] - How Chris responds to Robbie's issue with TypeScript.\n * [43:50] - What a first-class component template is.\n * [52:14] - A music and Hot Ones-themed whatnot.\u00a0\n * [57:43] - The one thing Chris always plugs for developers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[16:27] - \"TypeScript support is pretty essential to modern web development.

                "summary": "As developers, advancing in our careers can feel like the wild west. No guardrails, no handbook, and no standard path to success, everyone has a unique story when it comes to their coding career.\u00a0\n\nFar from a developer since childhood, Jen's no stranger to the unconventional path. Her Ember education grew within an accelerator while the bulk of her skillset expanded working in open source. While not an ideal path for everyone, the small startup environment and ability to learn from others in the Ember community was integral to Jen's growth.\n\nBut what if there was a way to standardize? And what should come first, a standardization of skillset or ethics? At a time when tech is advancing faster than ever and Artificial Intelligence has entered the chat, Jen Weber would argue that a need for some ethical benchmarks is the more urgent ticket.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie talk with Jen about the imperfect path to developer success, how to standardize an ever-evolving industry, the struggle to measure developer expertise, and why the Ember community is largely responsible for her growth, career, and overall outlook on tech.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [00:26] - An introduction to Jen.\u00a0\n * [01:18] - A whiskey review and freezing the perfect ice.\u00a0\n * [09:32] - How Jen was introduced to Ember.\n * [14:57] - What working at a startup taught Jen about developing.\u00a0\n * [19:20] - Why creating a standardized roadmap for developers is a helpful step.\u00a0\n * [23:24] - What Jen thinks about ethical standardization.\u00a0\n * [37:06] - The challenges of measuring developer expertise.\u00a0\n * [42:57] - What hobbies Jen has outside of tech and a food-themed whatnot.\u00a0\n * [53:25] - A midwest chat.\u00a0\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[09:47] - \"Good coding often follows certain patterns. And there's lots of different terminology and there's tons of blog articles written about what all those different patterns are, and some of them are just kind of baked into Ember.\" ~ @jwwweber [https://twitter.com/jwwweber]\n\n[10:20] - \"The [Ember] community became kind of my lifeline for figuring out how to do tricky things that were outside of what I had already learned so far, that were outside of the intro guides and tutorials. So I spent a lot of time building my knowledge through the help of other people.\" ~ @jwwweber [https://twitter.com/jwwweber]\n\n[13:07] - \"I hesitate sometimes to say, 'work in open source' because it's unpaid, on your own time. That was how I did it, and it benefited me hugely, but also I'm interested in finding out other people's pathways to being successful, to growing their skills, to reaching more senior engineering levels than just this one meandering way.\" ~ @jwwweber [https://twitter.com/jwwweber]\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n * Jen Weber [https://twitter.com/jwwweber]\n * Ember.js [https://emberjs.com]\n * Belfour Bourbon Whiskey Finished With Texas Pecan Wood [https://belfourspirits.com/our-spirits/bourbon-whiskey-finished-texas-pecan-wood]\n * Maker's Mark 46 [https://www.makersmark.com/makers-mark-46]\n * Watcher's Whiskey Tea [https://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/blend.html?blend=86010]\n * React [https://reactjs.org]\n * JavaScript [https://www.javascript.com]\n * Twitter [http://twitter.com]\n * Blockchain [https://www.blockchain.com]\n * Dropbox [http://dropbox.com]\u00a0\n * Adobe Dreamweaver\u00a0 [https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html]\n * Astro [https://astro.build]\n * Ember for React Developers [https://www.notion.so/Ember-For-React-Developers-556a5d343cfb4f8dab1f4d631c05c95b]"

Juan Palomino, founder of <a href=\"https://fullspeedav.com\">Full Speed Media</a>, has spent the last year knee-deep in his own NFT experiment.

When he finally stumbled upon Ember, the pitfalls and confusion were obvious and almost immediately he abandoned the framework. But runspired soon realized that features within Ember matched the ideas he began developing in his own framework years prior. Suddenly, everything clicked and today runspired is an Ember aficionado with big ideas on the future of framework and the secrets to cutting edge optimization.</p><p>In this episode, Robbie, Chuck, and runspired discuss flaws in the developer community, why Orbit is useful, shifting the approach to API frameworks, and why JSON:API and GraphQL are a match made in developer heaven.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p><ul>\n<li>[01:37] - A whiskey review.</li>\n<li>[11:26] - How runspired\u2019s journey in the Ember community evolved.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>[20:22] - What runspired thinks about RedwoodJS and API frameworks.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>[24:03] - Why Orbit is flawed but incredibly useful.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>[29:45] - What\u2019s missing from the developer community.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>[36:01] - Why JSON:API and GraphQL are a perfect marriage.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>[41:59] - What Ember Data cares about.</li>\n<li>[48:01] - A conversation about whatnot including Chris\u2019 dive into professional running.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>[55:55] - A cause runspired cares about in the Ember community.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Quotes</strong></p><p>[18:30] - \u201cI\u2019ve never found a reason to want to re-evaluate Ember as my main framework. Every time I\u2019ve had a complaint, it\u2019s evolved to satisfy that complaint with time.\u201d ~ <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/runspired/\">runspired</a></p><p>[23:00] - \u201cSo many of the problems that I see applications encounter late in their life cycles are problems where the API framework just wasn\u2019t set up well in the first place.

If you\u2019ve ever wondered how he ended up at Ship Shape and where Chuck first discovered the world of the web, today\u2019s episode explores his digital origin story.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Robbie, Chuck\u2019s foray into software development began in Photoshop. In fact, for a period after graduating college, Chuck considered going to photography school.
