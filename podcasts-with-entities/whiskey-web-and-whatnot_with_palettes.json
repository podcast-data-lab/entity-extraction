Robbie used a Tailwind template in Next.js due to its modern features and the ease of leveraging Next.js&#39; capabilities.

But his journey into the world of web development traces back to his earliest memory, captured in a nostalgic photo from 1987 of him sitting on his dad&#39;s lap gazing at a computer tower.</p>\n<p> <br>Today Stephen contributes to building one of the most widely used code editors for the web. CodePen, as Stephen reveals, is a dynamic social network where people share code samples and demos among a vibrant community. Stephen reminisces about his involvement in working on Ken Wheeler&#39;s cash and using classic web animation tools like GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). He&#39;s also keen on exploring what lies ahead. Stephen predicts that Apple&#39;s rumored headset device will harness the power of AR/VR, pushing developers to adapt to the technology.</p>\n<p>\nIn this episode, Stephen talks to Robbie and Chuck about his challenges using typescript at CodePen, the evolution of web animation tools, and the future of VR and AR on the web. <br></p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>\n<ul>\n <li>[00:35] - An Introduction to Stephen Shaw.\n\n</li>\n <li>[01:53] - A whiskey review: Angels Envy Straight Bourbon Whiskey.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[07:00] - Tech hot takes.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[09:58] - Why Stephen\u2019s team is converting projects to typescript.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[18:21] - Stephen talks about his time maintaining cash.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[21:11] - How to design web animations.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[24:44] - Stephen discusses the future of VR and AR on the web.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[35:07] - Stephen\u2019s career journey.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[42:45] - Chuck, Robbie, and Stephen explore gaming.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[47:48] - Stephen&#39;s other hobbies.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>\n<p>\n[07:32] - \u201cIf you have an existing code that works, don\u2019t add typescript.

With nine years of experience under his belt, Nathan made the bold decision to leave GitHub and start a new venture: building Zed, a code editor that captures his vast knowledge and ambitious goals.<br>Nathan opens up about the frustrations he faced with web technology, specifically Electron, which was initially developed to construct Atom but ended up being a resource-hungry burden. Zed, on the other hand, aims to be a more streamlined and efficient code editor by harnessing the power of Rust.

Bun is a next-generation Javascript runtime bundler, transpiler, and NPM package manager that promises lightning-fast speeds. It&#39;s already making waves in the industry. The company secured seven million dollars in funding to build hosting for Bun in August 2022.</p>\n<p><br>One of the secrets to Bun&#39;s success is its use of the underrated programming language Zig. Jarred explains that Zig allowed him to be incredibly productive and save time with its memory allocator.

Today, Chuck and Robbie wonder if it will ever make a comeback. <br>In addition to following up on last week\u2019s episode about input types, Chuck and Robbie remember the days when software piracy was rampant and how it affected the industry. This leads to a discussion about the blockchain and how everyone seemed to jump on the bandwagon a few years ago. But now, the technology seems to have faded into the background.

TanStack&#39;s other products include a router currently in beta, TanStack Query Table, TanStack Virtual, and TanStack Ranger. Tanner explains that he started building these tools while working on his SEO analytical platform, Nozzle, where they were created to solve the challenges he faced while developing the platform.

Robbie kicks off the tech talk by sharing his misadventures trying to figure out pnpm leading Chuck to ask the burning question \u201cWould you wear a pnpm T-shirt?\u201d<br>Despite Robbie\u2019s struggles in pnpm, he still believes it is the better option compared to alternatives like npm, Yarn V1, or Yarn V3. The duo agree that pnpm fixes the biggest problem with traditional package managers like npm and Yarn V1, which is hoisting. The duo dive deep into the technical aspects of package management, discussing the challenges of installing and managing dependencies in a large-scale project, and how pnpm addresses these challenges. They cover topics like global caching, peer dependencies, and the correct way to define dependencies.<br>In this episode, Robbie and Chuck talk about the pros and cons of pnpm, the downsides of using algorithm tests to vet developers, and the exciting new changes coming to Angular. \n</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>\n<ul>\n <li>[00:30] - Chuck and Robbie ask for feedback and suggestions from listeners.\n\n</li>\n <li>[03:55] - A whiskey Review: Michter\u2019s Kentucky Straight Rye. \n\n</li>\n  <li>[09:43] -  Robbie talks about his pnpm adventure.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[25:34] - Chuck and Robbie\u2019s thoughts on algorithms testing. \n\n</li>\n  <li>[28:51] - The big changes coming to Angular.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[38:05] - Robbie talks about his 1970 Ford Bronco.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[43:22] - Chuck talks about Ted Lasso season three and other TV shows.\n\n</li>\n  <li>[53:15] - Chuck and Robbie talk about upcoming video games.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>\n<p>\n[21:35] - \u201cThe idea of having separate apps in a separate package and piecing those together, good idea.

Schott, CEO of the Astro Technology Company, says it\u2019s all in the framework\u2019s content focus and island architecture. For Fred, the aim is to have a tool that&#39;s HTML-first but still sprinkles in interactivity and allows developers to bring in components from other frameworks. They focused on solving the problem of sending a full JavaScript application to power a mostly static site. The attention to developer experience paid off and is one of the reasons Astro is creating waves in the developer community. <br><br>In this episode, Fred talks with Chuck and Robbie about how Astro uses an HTML-first approach to create content-focused websites, the latest features of Astro V2, and the trend of blindly using popular frameworks like React.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>\n<ul>\n <li>[00:21] - An introduction to Fred K.

CSS hit the bullseye when it introduced trigonometry functions to boost performance by avoiding Javascript. But Cypress has been a big letdown in DX.<br>Before introducing trig functions, CSS was pretty limited and it relied on Javascript to do all the complex styling. Since Javascript takes a significant amount of time to parse, that\u2019s a big hit to your overall page speed. Now, CSS trig functions allow more flexibility to style pages with angles.

Working with data isn\u2019t a part of every developer\u2019s day-to-day, but it can\u2019t hurt to understand the differences.</p>\n<p>NoSQL is gaining popularity among engineers because of the ease and flexibility of updating fields with new data. Some engineers prefer taking unstructured data and using a programming language they already know, like Python, to write their queries. SQL is far more structured and requires strict rules for writing queries. As with most things in tech, whether SQL is better than NoSQL depends on your business and use cases.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Robbie and Chuck talk about the pros and cons of SQL vs NoSQL, why they like SQL databases like Prisma and Postgres, and their Christmas and New Year festivities.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>\n<ul>\n <li>[00:56] - Chuck and Robbie wrap up the Advent of

Working with data isn\u2019t a part of every developer\u2019s day-to-day, but it can\u2019t hurt to understand the differences.\nNoSQL is gaining popularity among engineers because of the ease and flexibility of updating fields with new data. Some engineers prefer taking unstructured data and using a programming language they already know, like Python, to write their queries.

                "summary": "While multi-page apps (MPAs) seem like a new fixation for the developer community, they're pretty ancient news. If you were browsing the web in the 90s, you were likely visiting a multi-page app. Lucky for us, web tech improved, and made the entire experience of multi-page apps more appealing.\n\nOne of the cons of MPAs is that they don't have preload and prefetch out of the box. Single-page apps (SPAs) on the other hand give you the power to decide how your site loads by loading all the resources for your current page and fetching resources for a page you might navigate to after. This might seem small but it makes a huge impact on your site.\u00a0\n\nThe good news is, more computing power gave way to better server-rendered technology, a huge win for multi-page apps. Unlike single-page apps (SPAs), multi-page apps parse very little JavaScript. That shaves seconds off your initial load which is no small feat.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie discuss the pros and cons of multi-page apps,\u00a0the benefits and the distinction between prefetch vs preload, and the good old days on the internet.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [02:10] - A whiskey review - Wolves Signature Blend Special Release.\n * [08:02] - Chuck and Robbie discuss multi-page apps.\n * [13:46] - Advantages and disadvantages of multi-page apps.\n * [27:13] - Robbie's opinion on the React Framework.\u00a0\u00a0\n * [35:47] - Chuck and Robbie reminisce about StumbleUpon and earlier social media sites.\n * [41:52] - Chuck and Robbie discuss their parents' internet use.\n * [44:30] - Chuck and Robbie talk about their weekend.\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[8:15] - \"Were you around in 1998 when the Internet was first blowing up?

If you're not familiar with the syntax, that could pose a major learning curve. With native apps, it's tempting to have a separate app for every device that a user might run your app on, but on the operations front, that's a slippery slope with high overhead costs.

And with the simple thing from Vue, without the baggage from Vue.\" ~ Dan Jutan [https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-jutan-5bb78222b/]\n\n[24:28] - \"If you're looking for a framework to run that interactive part of the page, Solid is a great choice because it's super small and super fast.\" ~ Dan Jutan [https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-jutan-5bb78222b/]\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n * Dan Jutan LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-jutan-5bb78222b/]\n * Dan Jutan Twitter [https://twitter.com/jutanium?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor]\n * Astro [https://astro.build/]\n * Solid [https://www.solidjs.com/]\n * Game of Thrones [https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones]\n * Frey Ranch Bourbon [https://freyranch.com/straight-bourbon-whiskey/]\n * Vue [https://vuejs.org/]\n * React [https://reactjs.org/]\n * Knockout JS [https://knockoutjs.com/]\n * Ember [https://emberjs.com/]\n * RX JS [https://rxjs.dev/]\n * Preact [https://preactjs.com/]\n * Svelte [https://svelte.dev/]\u00a0\u00a0\n * Codemirror [https://codemirror.net/]\n * Next [https://nextjs.org/]\n * Twitter [https://twitter.com/?lang=en]\n * Remix [https://remix.run/]\n * Solid Start [https://docs.solidjs.com/start]\n * Ryan Florence [https://ryanflorence.com/]\n * Kent C.

How can you successfully juggle a career, side hustles, and make time for your passions?\n\nKelly Vaughn, Engineering Manager at Spot AI, has some thoughts. She is leading a diverse, fully remote, global team that spans from California to India. Kelly keeps her management style flexible to account for the quirks and personality types of her team. When she's not steering the ship at Spot AI, she's advising several startups and working as a consultant.

Championing accessibility is only possible if devs prioritize it and a good place to start is by knowing your HTML elements. If dogs can learn 50 human words, then devs can learn 50 HTML elements.\n\nOn another note, not all package managers are made equal. Robbie has been loyal to Yarn for years and is okay with waiting a few minutes for installs. But from Chuck's operations perspective, when you're talking about continuous integration that can eat up a huge chunk of your day, it might be time to look for something that promises speed.\n\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie talk about the importance of knowing your HTML elements, the pros and cons of different package managers, and the Whiskey Web and Whatnot NFT drop.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [02:09] - Why Chuck and Robbie struggle to find time for reading.\n * [04:43] - A whiskey review - Huling Station.\n * [12:27] - How many HTML elements can Chuck and Robbie name.\n * [26:25] - How to choose the right package manager.\n * [41:27] - Chuck and Robbie's eventful trips.\n * [56:14] - Whiskey Web and Whatnot's NFT drop.\n\n\u00a0\n\nQuotes\n\n[03:32] - \"You can fit in anything that you prioritize, right? If you said working out is the same as eating, it has to be done. You would find time.\" ~ @rwwagner90 [https://twitter.com/rwwagner90]\n\n[26:38] - \"I think HTML is real, and it hasn't been the first-class citizen that it deserves in terms of the Internet itself, whose intention was to distribute documents and have that accessible across schools and scientific organizations and whatever else.

No major thought for those using the interface he created.\u00a0\n\nMark's perspective changed when he sat with a few folks who were blind or had low vision, and watched as they used assistive technology for the web and attempted to navigate a site he'd developed. Their struggle to tackle basic web functions against inaccessible code was Mark's wake-up moment and his inspiration to close the gap between emerging developers and accessibility education.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie talk with Mark about his passion for accessibility, where most web accessibility issues originate, practical tips for incorporating accessibility into developer workflow, and why accessibility means more than checking a box, meeting quota, and passing a test.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [00:44] - A quick intro to Mark.\u00a0\n * [02:52] - A whiskey review - Angel's Envy Bourbon Port Finish.\u00a0\n * [11:47] - How Mark became an accessibility specialist.\u00a0\n * [19:28] - Where the web accessibility issue originates.\u00a0\n * [27:41] - How to make data visualization accessible.\u00a0\n * [34:29] - The major accessibility complaint we fail to consider with JavaScript frameworks.\n * [36:17] - How to keep developers and frameworks on the right track with accessibility.\u00a0\n * [44:22] - A Star Wars-themed whatnot.\u00a0\n * [50:37] - Why Mark likes college football (and their stadiums).\u00a0\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[01:50] - \"I feel like there's a gap in the field right now where developers are kind of not being reached out to from the accessibility side of things.

Meanwhile, Chuck and Robbie have thoughts about Apple's new products, the purpose of React, plus Fig, Hyper, Warp, and everything in between.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie discuss everything you probably don't know about terminals, why Robbie's eyeing Redwood, what Chuck and Robbie actually paid attention to from WWDC22, why developers are so excited about Bun, and why Chuck's trip to Italy was semi-catastrophic.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [00:48] - A whiskey review.\n * [09:07] - Robbie's terminal tips and tricks.\u00a0\n * [15:38] - Why looking cool matters the most.\u00a0\n * [22:28] - A few interesting things from WWDC.\n * [28:55] - Chuck and Robbie react to React.\u00a0\n * [34:00] - A whatnot about Chuck's semi-catastrophic trip to Italy.\u00a0\n * [49:11] - An update on the Ship Shape NFT.\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[15:23] - \"Bash hasn't innovated at all.

I don't even have to know Next and I know it because it's a good framework. React by itself is just a huge learning curve. Because it's like, 'ok we're going to do all this stuff that looks nothing like anything anyone else is doing.'\" ~ @rwwagner90 [https://twitter.com/rwwagner90]\n\n[29:54] - \"React is becoming more opinionated as its user base continues to grow and becomes more opinionated.\" ~ @CharlesWthe3rd [https://twitter.com/CharlesWthe3rd]\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n * Beast Masters Club Private Barrell - Elijah Craig - \"Three Tenors, Hogze Carreras\"\u00a0 [https://www.beastmastersclub.com/shop/pinhook-gn4pm-92ty8-zpx4f]\n * Slack [http://www.slack.com]\n * Whiskey Web and Whatnot: A Battle of Two Worlds and Mentorship Above Milestones with Cory Brown [https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm/a-battle-of-two-worlds-and-mentorship-above-milestones-with-cory-brown/]\n * Buffalo Trace [https://www.buffalotracedistillery.com]\n * Eagle Rare [https://eaglerare.com]\n * The FRIENDS Experience\u00a0 [https://www.friendstheexperience.com]\n * 5 Tips to Improve Your Terminal Experience [https://shipshape.io/blog/five-tips-to-improve-your-terminal-experience/]\n * Amazon [http://www.amazon.com]\n * iTerm\u00a0 [https://iterm2.com]\n * Hyper [https://hyper.is]\n * Warp [https://www.warp.dev]\n * fish shell [https://fishshell.com]\n * Fig [https://fig.io]\n * Z shell\u00a0 [https://zsh.sourceforge.io]\n * dotfiles [https://dotfiles.github.io]\u00a0\u00a0\n * Homebrew [https://brew.sh]\n * Homebrew cask [https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask]\u00a0\n * MonoLisa font [https://www.monolisa.dev]\n * Starship [https://starship.rs]\n * Node.js [https://nodejs.org]\n * Rust [https://www.rust-lang.org]\n * Ember [https://emberjs.com]\n * LinkedIn [http://www.linkedin.com]\n * Bun [https://bun.sh]\n * Discord\u00a0 [https://discord.com]\n * Remix [https://remix.run]\n * Next.js [https://nextjs.org]\n * API Routes [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction]\n * Middleware [https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware]\n * WWDC22 [https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/]\n"

While James had dabbled in Ember previously, an ask to reimplement the front-end in Ember, this time using TypeScript, proved challenging.\u00a0\n\nAt the time, a few engineers were using TypeScript in Ember, but the open source framework James worked on became the de-facto reference point for projects in Ember types.

There's an art to testing beyond just striving to get 100% coverage. In fact, over-testing can actually hamper your progress more than help it. Meanwhile, Chuck's wondering why it's not possible to have a union of enums in GraphQL.\n\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie discuss some tech frustrations, lessons for the React community, why Ship Shape implemented spam traps, and a whatnot on all things alcohol, sports, Friends, and Robbie's (seemingly endless) truck saga.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [01:50] - A lengthy whiskey review.\u00a0\n * [22:53] - Why getting carried away with tests becomes your downfall.\u00a0\n * [34:50] - Why Chuck thinks these tests in the React community are useless.\u00a0\n * [38:16] - Chuck's GraphQL confusion.\u00a0\n * [40:49] - A browser bug Chuck noticed.\u00a0\n * [44:09] - Robbie's non-sponsored plug.\n * [44:50] - A sports-themed whatnot and an update on Robbie's truck saga.\u00a0\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[26:52] - \"There are things that warrant tests and things that don't and there are good best practices for writing them.\" ~ @rwwagner90 [https://twitter.com/rwwagner90]\n\n[33:44] - \"Sometimes people will just chase the goal of as close to 100% coverage as possible and then you end up with a bunch of egregious tests along the way.\" ~ @CharlesWthe3rd [https://twitter.com/CharlesWthe3rd]\n\n[34:00] - \"You need to test what's business-critical. You can do the other tests if you have the time. But there were a lot of tests that really didn't even check anything. And it's kind of arbitrary \u2014 you got that coverage, but you weren't doing anything.\" ~ @rwwagner90 [https://twitter.com/rwwagner90]\n\n[36:32] - \"Cypress is a great example of having integration testing in context where you can get visual progression testing too so [you] have some understanding there.\" ~ @CharlesWthe3rd [https://twitter.com/CharlesWthe3rd]\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n * Maker's Mark No. 46 [https://www.makersmark.com/makers-mark-46]\n * Maker's Mark Cask Strength [https://www.makersmark.com/makers-mark-cask-strength]\n * Maker's Mark Private Selection [https://www.makersmark.com/makers-mark-private-selection]\n * Woodford Reserve [https://www.woodfordreserve.com/]\n * Jack Rose Dining Saloon [http://jackrosediningsaloon.com/]\n * The FRIENDS Experience\u00a0 [https://www.friendstheexperience.com/]\n * Mocha [https://mochajs.org/]\n * Jest [https://jestjs.io/]\n * Ember.js [https://emberjs.com/]\n * Slack [http://slack.com]\n * reCAPTCHA [https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/]\n * React [https://reactjs.org/]\n * Cypress\u00a0 [https://www.cypress.io/]\n * Facebook [http://facebook.com]\n * Vite [https://vitejs.dev/]\u00a0\n * GraphQL [https://graphql.org/]\n * Chuck on Twitter [https://twitter.com/CharlesWthe3rd]\n * Elon Musk [https://twitter.com/elonmusk]\n * Starlink [https://www.starlink.com/]\n * Netlify\u00a0 [https://www.netlify.com/]\n * Middesk [https://www.middesk.com/agent]\n * QuickBooks [https://quickbooks.intuit.com/]\n * Walkabout Mini Golf on Oculus Quest [https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2462678267173943/]\n * Holey Moley [https://abc.com/shows/holey-moley]\n * Steph Curry [https://twitter.com/StephenCurry30]\u00a0\n * Topgolf [https://topgolf.com/us/]\n * Rivian [https://rivian.com/]\n\n\n</\n"

His primary goal became solving semantic versioning for TS. As Chris kept iterating, striving to combine multiple programming worlds, other engineers joined him in the pursuit until eventually, the Ember TypeScript Core team was born.\u00a0\n\nToday, Chris is a lead engineer at LinkedIn, a father, husband, runner, music composer, and whiskey enthusiast. His current goal is to ensure Ember Polaris has first-class TypeScript support.

Chuck and Robbie have mixed feelings on both monorepus and Shiba Inu tokens and they're probably not the only ones conflicted. Developer tools and the metaverse are complex topics that don't always yield solidly positive or negative results.\u00a0\n\nThe beauty of our ever-evolving digital space is the ability to continually iterate and learn from what's not working. Having said that, just because something is new (and trending on Twitter) doesn't mean it's the best tool for the job, nor that it should be used for anything besides its original purpose. Between monorepos and digital coins, sometimes the hype outweighs the benefit.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie discuss their thoughts on monorepos, the downside to trending languages and developer tools, why the metaverse should be approached with caution, plus a whatnot covering everything under the sun.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [01:22] - A brief whatnot on SNOOs and Robbie's status as a new parent.\n * [02:55] - A whiskey review.\n * [12:29] - Why Robbie can't wrap his head around monorepos.\u00a0\n * [28:20] - Why Robbie is (semi) entrenched in the metaverse.\u00a0\n * [34:21] - Chuck and Robbie's take on the Oscar slap and the future of comedy.\n * [37:16] - A less serious whatnot about podcasts, electric cars, entertainment, and new babies.\u00a0\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[21:43] - \"I think that there's good practice in saying 'why?' But I don't think everything should always be one way. I think that [you should] just use the best tool for the job when you come across that.\" ~ @CharlesWthe3rd [https://twitter.com/CharlesWthe3rd]\n\n[22:04] - \"There are cases where monorepo could work and be good for people. I'm not saying they suck all the time. It's my argument with everything \u2014 people use React because they think it's cool, people use TypeScript because they think it's the hotness, we need to type everything. Monorepos are cool because some guy said, 'hey these are cool.' If it's not solving a real problem for you, just remove that from the code.\" ~ @rwwagner90 [https://mobile.twitter.com/rwwagner90]\n\n[31:31] - \"I still believe in the utility of the technology [of NFTs]. I do believe that there's something there. And people are just going to get more clever in the way that they apply that and there will be more security down the line. There's just way too many rug pulls these days to really make it all worth something.\" ~ @CharlesWthe3rd [https://twitter.com/CharlesWthe3rd]\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n * SNOO [https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-smart-bassinet]\n * Calumet Farm 12 Year Old Single Rack Black [https://www.calumetbourbon.com/12yo-singlerackblack]\n * Guinness Factory [https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/]\n * Jack Daniel's [https://www.jackdaniels.com]\n * Sagamore Spirit [https://sagamorespirit.com]\n * Safari [https://www.apple.com/safari/]\n * Rails [https://rubyonrails.org]\n * Lerna\u00a0 [https://lerna.js.org]\n * JSON [https://www.json.org/json-en.html]\n * TypeScript\u00a0 [https://www.typescriptlang.org]\n * Ember.js [https://emberjs.com]\n * React\u00a0 [https://reactjs.org]\n * Facebook [http://facebook.com]\n * Remix [https://remix.run]\n * Shiba Token [https://shibatoken.com]\n * SHIBOSHIS [https://shiboshis.shibaswap.com/#/]\n * The RECUR Portal Pass [https://pass.recurforever.com]\n * Netflix [http://netflix.com]\n * Darknet Diaries [https://darknetdiaries.com]\n * PRO-SPEED Autow [https://www.prospeedautoworks.com]\n"

            "content": "When someone hands you an opportunity to specialize, to do something crazy with people you like, to learn from people building something before your eyes, it's difficult to pass up. An opportunity like that prompted Chris to leave LinkedIn for Bitski, a digital wallet for buying, selling, and storing NFTs.\u00a0\n\nLeaving what's safe and secure for what's largely unknown is definitely a risk, but Chris is a risk-taker. Despite loving Rust, Chris wanted to move away from JavaScript in the years ahead and expand his developer horizons. Plus, he's learned from experience that becoming emotionally attached to whatever you're using is a dangerous game.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, Chris talks with Chuck and Robbie about a lack of resources and corporate greed in open source, the framework eras we've lived through and what's to come, why workers are incredible, choosing a career path, and how to keep developing as a developer.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [00:23] - Introducing Chris and his recent good news.\n * [03:20] - An heirloom whiskey review.\u00a0\n * [10:12] - Why Chris left LinkedIn and what he's up to now.\u00a0\n * [17:20] - What Chris learned from React.\n * [18:58] - A chat about Classes, Functions, and Tailwind.\n * [26:20] - What goes awry with execution in open source.\n * [34:33] - Why open source is not sustainable and a brief history of the framework eras.\n * [40:40] - Why Bitski has moved away from Ember.\u00a0\n * [46:49] - What Chris thinks about Web3.\u00a0\n * [53:37] - A DC, Disney, and Cars-themed whatnot.\u00a0\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[14:33] - \"Honestly, I've worked with JavaScript for 10 years now and I don't ever want to become one of those one-language devs. So I would like to be able to transition away from JavaScript at some point. Or at least transition into being able to work in multiple languages\" ~ @pzuraq [https://twitter.com/pzuraq]\n\n[28:51] - \"We built these primitives so that anybody can do it.

And so it's always like working backward from what user experience is going to be best and then how do you pick the tools, and the stack, and the technology to try to achieve that.\" ~ @zachlloydtweets [https://twitter.com/zachlloydtweets]\n\n[30:33] - \"In my experience, the best engineers who I've worked with and who I prefer to work with are people who are seeing the technology as a tool for achieving an end-user result or for solving some problem.\" ~ @zachlloydtweets [https://twitter.com/zachlloydtweets]\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n * Zach Lloyd [http://@zachlloydtweets]\n * Porsche Experience Center [https://www.porschedriving.com/los-angeles]\n * Warp [https://www.warp.dev]\n * Google Workspace [https://workspace.google.com]\n * Figma [https://www.figma.com]\n * Stellum Bourbon [https://www.stellum.com/bourbon]\n * Maynard James Keenan's wine (Caduceus) [https://caduceus.org]\n * Pappy Van Winkle's Whiskey [https://www.oldripvanwinkle.com]\n * Jim Beam [https://www.jimbeam.com/]\n * Total Wine [https://www.totalwine.com]\n * Seelbach's [https://seelbachs.com]\n * Chuck on Twitter [https://twitter.com/CharlesWthe3rd]\n * MGP of Indiana [https://www.mgpingredients.com]\n * Heaven Hill Distillery [https://heavenhilldistillery.com]\n * George Dickel Whiskey Distillery [https://www.georgedickel.com]\n * Jack Daniel's\u00a0 [https://www.jackdaniels.com]\n * High West Whiskey [https://www.highwest.com/products/american-prairie-bourbon]\n * Rust [https://www.rust-lang.org]\n * iTerm [https://iterm2.com]\n * Google Sheets\u00a0 [https://www.google.com/sheets/about/]\n * JavaScript [https://www.javascript.com]\n"

                "summary": "As Chris Thoburn (otherwise known as runspired) began prepping for his own Whiskey Web and Whatnot, he found himself driving along to Chris Manson's episode from a few weeks prior. Nodding along as Chris explained his point of view on all things Ember, runspired suddenly slammed on the brakes after hearing one pivotal sentence.\u00a0\n\nAt the center of his break slam and today's fierce disagreement? The value of TypeScript and its place in the Ember community. Fortunately, Chris and Chris have the same end goal: to encourage more developers to use Ember and contribute to Ember projects. But how do we keep Ember contributor-friendly while keeping contributions careful? One of them yearns for a happy medium and the other feels that balance is forever impossible.\n\nIn this episode, runspired and Chris Manson battle it out, discussing TypeScript's place in the Ember community and balancing the volume of Ember contributors with the accuracy of developer edits.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [02:49] - A whiskey review.\u00a0\n * [09:55] - What whiskey and NFTs have in common.\u00a0\n * [11:37] - Runspired explains the source of his smackdown with Chris Manson.\u00a0\n * [15:38] - Where Chris Manson and runspired stand on TypeScript.\u00a0\n * [19:29] - Chris Manson's side of the story.\n * [20:02] - How runspired and Chris Manson think we'll get more developers contributing to Ember.\u00a0\n * [29:09] - Where runspired and Chris Manson actually agree.\n * [37:18] - Where Chris Manson stands on TypeScript.\u00a0\n * [40:56] - How to balance contributor-friendly with contributor careful.\u00a0\n * [44:58] - The problem with Ember sponsorships and Ember advocates.\u00a0\n * [01:02:53] - Some closing thoughts on today's smackdown, Peaky Blinders, and an NFT-themed whatnot.\u00a0\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[26:19] - \"The more that we've adopted TypeScript, the more I've seen people capable of making a contribution without my assistance that had the right fix.\" ~ runspired [https://www.instagram.com/runspired/]\n\n[43:20] - \"I see Ember Learn, the org, and all of the things that we maintain, as kind of a gateway drug to becoming an Ember CLI contributor, a framework contributor, an Ember Data contributor.

Juan Palomino, founder of Full Speed Media [https://fullspeedav.com], has spent the last year knee-deep in his own NFT experiment. Along the way, he's learned what to embrace and what to forget when it comes to making his mark in the digital economy.\u00a0\n\nJuan started Full Speed Media as a way to provide live streaming services throughout the pandemic. While it began as a way to simply satisfy a growing demand, through his business, Juan began developing relationships with local organizations in Phoenix and realized the need for other web-based projects geared toward fundraising.\u00a0\n\nA true lover of building cool stuff and experimenting with the latest tech trends, Juan eventually developed an NFT drop in partnership with a local artist. Since launch day, his community has minted almost 100 tokens and raised just under $10,000 for the Valleywise Health Foundation [https://valleywisehealthfoundation.org], the largest provider of mental health services in Arizona.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, Robbie, Chuck, and Juan discuss the technicalities of building an NFT, where most developers miss the mark in blockchain, and the real beauty of a growing minted marketplace.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [01:13] - A quick introduction to Juan.\n * [02:37] - Two truths and a lie.\u00a0\n * [06:25] - A whiskey review.\u00a0\n * [14:19] - Chuck's two truths and a brief history of Philadelphia.\u00a0\n * [17:54] - Juan's groundbreaking NFT fundraising project.\u00a0\n * [23:17] - How tech trends like NFTs and smart contracts actually work.\u00a0\n * [27:11] - How Juan algorithmically generates NFT images.\n * [31:20] - The right way to approach NFTs and why fees.wtf missed the mark.\u00a0\n * [45:40] - What's the deal with DAOs?\u00a0\n * [46:50] - Where the blockchain truly belongs.\n * [49:06] - Why Chuck is back on Twitter.\u00a0\n * [52:13] - The beauty of the NFT space.\u00a0\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[41:31] - \"Blockchain in itself is not this secret ingredient that now makes everything better. It has become this buzzword that people want to do a land grab for but realistically, this is just the building blocks of how we're going to build bigger, better, more decentralized, more trustless applications and systems.\" ~ @JuanForTheMoney [https://twitter.com/juanforthemoney]\n\n[52:47] - \"The NFT space, for all its quirks and mishappenings and lost gas fees, has really turned me onto the art world and has exposed me to a whole different way of creating stuff and connected me with a lot of people I might not have been connected with otherwise.

Juan Palomino, founder of Full Speed Media [https://fullspeedav.com], has spent the last year knee-deep in his own NFT experiment. Along the way, he's learned what to embrace and what to forget when it comes to making his mark in the digital economy.\u00a0\n\nJuan started Full Speed Media as a way to provide live streaming services throughout the pandemic.

If you\u2019ve ever wondered how he ended up at Ship Shape and where Chuck first discovered the world of the web, today\u2019s episode explores his digital origin story. </p>\n<p>\nLike Robbie, Chuck\u2019s foray into software development began in Photoshop. In fact, for a period after graduating college, Chuck considered going to photography school.

Shiny object syndrome is a real thing, and it's easy to feel like there's too much to keep up with.\n\nWes Bos has his own point of view on the shifting landscape. Wes has spent years as a developer and has created a catalog of courses to help other developers improve their skills. Despite having his favorites, Wes argues there's a place for everything in the melting pot that is modern web development.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, Robbie, Chuck, and Wes discuss the rise of specialized frameworks, the future of frameworks like TypeScript, and Wes' views on technology outside the workplace.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n * [00:27] \u2013 Who is Wes Bos?\n * [01:40] \u2013 Wes or Robbie or Both?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n * [05:42] \u2013 Whiskey review\n * [18:46] \u2013 The benefits of Next.js 12\n * [21:03] \u2013 React vs. Svelte\u00a0\n * [26:20] \u2013 Wes' thoughts on TypeScript\u00a0\n * [30:26] \u2013 Commiserating over IE 11\n * [33:52] \u2013 What Wes does in his free time\u00a0\n * [39:16] \u2013 Wes' vintage road bikes\n * [40:54] - Wes' tech-free BBQ saga\n * [50:59] - Wes' thoughts on tech podcasts\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n[19:08] - \"I don't think that Next.js is the SDK of the web. The whole point of the web is that it's open and it's just the standard language that you can build whatever you want on top of it. But that said, I'm probably the biggest Next.js fanboy out there.\" ~ @wesbos [https://twitter.com/wesbos]\n\n[19:24] - \"Next.js is making things really really simple for us.
