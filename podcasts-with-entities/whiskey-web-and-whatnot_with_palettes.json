What makes Astro unique in web development and what are its future possibilities?\u00a0\nFred K. Schott, CEO of the Astro Technology Company, says it\u2019s all in the framework\u2019s content focus and island architecture. For Fred, the aim is to have a tool that's HTML-first but still sprinkles in interactivity and allows developers to bring in components from other frameworks. They focused on solving the problem of sending a full JavaScript application to power a mostly static site.

Designers are all too familiar with having their work feel like a second priority to developers. Is there a way that designers and developers can collaborate successfully without sacrificing their individual needs?\nEnter Penpot, the first Open Source design and prototyping platform for cross-domain teams. Penpot was developed by Pablo Ruiz-M\u00fazquiz, CEO and Co-Founder of Kaleidos, Taiga and Penpot, to bring collaboration between designers and developers to the next level. Penpot inspires designers to become comfortable using open source and allows developers to become excited about the design process.\u00a0\nIn this episode, Pablo talks to Chuck and Robbie about how Penpot differs from its primary competitor, Figma, and why designers and developers love their platform.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[00:36] - An intro to Pablo Ruiz-M\u00fazquiz.\n\n[02:38] -\u00a0A whiskey review - Willet Family Estate Bottled Rye.\n\n[05:31] - Chuck, Robbie, and Pablo\u2019s whiskey ranking.\n\n[07:47] - What Penpot is and how it compares to Figma.\n\n[15:50] - Adobe\u2019s defensive acquisition of Figma.\u00a0\n\n[24:54] - Why Pablo is excited about Penpot.\n\n[29:37] - How Penpot brings together designers and developers.\n\n[34:30] - Two top priority feature requests for Penpot.\n\n[39:23] - Use cases for Penpot.\n\n[44:31] - Why Pablo got expelled.\n\n[48:34] - Pablo\u2019s diverse hobbies - from mead brewing to archery.\n\n\nQuotes\n[26:27] - \u201cWe don\u2019t just want to accelerate design into code, but also coding to design.\u201d ~ Pablo Ruiz-M\u00fazquiz\n[31:18] - \u201cFirst, we need to make sure that designers really appreciate what we\u2019re doing.

Memorizing algorithms and solving problems in 30 minutes isn\u2019t good enough to judge someone\u2019s capabilities and decide whether they can be trusted for a job.\nMany great developers crack under the pressure of interviews but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not good at what they do. The interview process is just a formality to verify someone\u2019s identity, it shouldn\u2019t be used to drill developers and set them up for failure.

Since then, it\u2019s sparked polarizing discourse between developers who either love it or hate it.\u00a0\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie talk to Adam about what motivated him to create Tailwind CSS, how Headless UI was born, why Tailwind is creating polarizing discourse among developers, and his powerlifting past.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[00:35] - An introduction to Adam Wathan.\n\n[01:55] - A whiskey review - W3WC Sagamore Rye Barrel Pick #001.\n\n[06:51] - Adam explains Tailwind CSS.\n\n[09:47] - The problems that inspired Adam to create Tailwind.\n\n[35:24] - How Headless UI fits into Tailwind.\n\n[41:09] - Whether Tailwind will support other frameworks in the future.\n\n[44:33] - Adam\u2019s powerlifting career.\n\n\nQuotes\n[16:47] - \u201cI started noticing that the only things that really survived every port were the things that were lower and lower level. Something like a class that adds margin left to something that's useful in every project, but a button might look different in every project.\u201d ~ Adam Wathan\n[23:40] - \u201cThe main problem that Tailwind is ultimately trying to solve is giving inline style superpowers. It's not like inline styles are evil, it's like inline styles are awesome. Let's make them super awesome.\u201d ~ Adam Wathan\n[24:10] - \u201cTo me, Tailwind is basically inline styles with a bunch of extra power bolted on.\u201d ~ Adam Wathan\n\nLinks\n\nAdam Wathan\n\nAdam Wathan Twitter\n\nAdam Wathan LinkedIn\n\nTailwind CSS\n\nTailwind UI\n\nDiscord\n\nCSS Zen Garden\n\nNicolas Gallagher\n\nNormalize CSS\n\nBootstrap\n\nLaravel\n\nVue\n\nReact\n\nRiverside\n\nChrome\n\nStimulus\n\nTwitter\n\nSelect2\n\nBEM\n\nAtomic CSS\n\nMarkdown\n\nHeadless UI\n\nSelect2\n\nSvelte\n\nCaleb Porzio\n\nAlpine JS\n\nSolid JS\n\nAcquia\n\nElon Musk\n\n\nConnect with our hosts\n\nRobbie Wagner\n\nChuck Carpenter\n\nShip Shape\n\n\nSubscribe and stay in touch\n\nApple Podcasts\n\nSpotify\n\nGoogle Podcasts\n\nWhiskey Web and Whatnot\n\n\nTop-Tier, Full-Stack Software Consultants\nThis show is brought to you by Ship Shape.

If you\u2019re not familiar with the syntax, that could pose a major learning curve. With native apps, it\u2019s tempting to have a separate app for every device that a user might run your app on, but on the operations front, that\u2019s a slippery slope with high overhead costs. If you\u2019re on a tight budget or working on small teams like Chuck and Robbie, the cost of paying developers to maintain a bunch of apps isn\u2019t appealing.

But the biggest win might be for e-commerce sites that need speed, performance, and personalization.\u00a0\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie talk to Daniel about the features of Nuxt 3, improving the developer experience, and his family vacation to Algarve, Portugal.\u00a0\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[00:38] - An introduction to Daniel Roe.\n\n[03:29] - A whiskey review - Laphroig Lore.\n\n[11:20] - The new features in Nuxt 3.\n\n[19:16] - The best path to convert projects to Nuxt 3.\n\n[32:47] - The target audience for Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3.\n\n[45:31] - Daniel\u2019s holiday in Portugal .\n\n[51:49] - David\u2019s side project in Magic Regexp.\n\n\nQuotes\n[12:21] - \u201cSome of the things that Nuxt 3 brings, well, it's been rewritten from the start, so it's given us an opportunity to do what we really wanted to do with Nuxt. And to learn from some of the mistakes we made for Nuxt 2 and adapt Nuxt for a new world. That sounds a bit crap, but more and more I think we're looking to take advantage of different kinds of hardware for rendering HTML.\u201d ~ @danielcroe\n[13:18] - \u201cNuxt 2, out of the box, is a bare minimum package. I did some checking on this. The cold start for the server was 300 milliseconds. With Nuxt 3, it is three milliseconds.\u201d ~ @danielcroe\n[38:48] - \u201cI always like using suppliers that win me over because they have the best of whatever it is. They're able to meet my needs. Whether that's experience or price point or whatever it is. But they've won me over. I don't have to stay with them. I'm not forced or coerced into it. I didn't make an early choice, and now I'm reaping the whirlwind and having to pay the price for it. I'm with them because I want to be. That's the best scenario. You have the power to choose. You're choosing the platform you feel is the best.\u201c ~ @danielcroe\n\nLinks\n\nDaniel Roe LinkedIn\n\nDaniel Roe Twitter\n\nNuxt\n\nVue\n\nBill Bryson\n\nDurham University\n\nBill Bryson Library\n\nLaphroig Lore\n\nLaphroig\n\nPringles\n\nVite\n\nWebpack\n\nTypeScript\n\nReact\n\nDiscord\n\nJest\n\nJavaScript\n\nRemix\n\nAstro\n\nSolid\n\nRedwood JS\n\nTom Preston Warner\n\nDigitalOcean\n\nVercel\n\nNetlify\n\nSunderland\n\nManchester United\n\nEric Cantona\n\nOld Trafford\u00a0\n\nVuejs Amsterdam\n\nMagic Regexp\n\nRegexper\n\nAnthony Fu\n\nDavid Tai\n\n\nConnect with our hosts\n\nRobbie Wagner\n\nChuck Carpenter\n\nShip Shape\n\n\nSubscribe and stay in touch\n\nApple Podcasts\n\nSpotify\n\nGoogle Podcasts\n\nWhiskey Web and Whatnot\n\n\nTop-Tier, Full-Stack Software Consultants\nThis show is brought to you by Ship Shape.

                "summary": "Devs have a lot on their plate, but the key is to find time for what\u2019s important. Championing accessibility is only possible if devs prioritize it and a good place to start is by knowing your HTML elements. If dogs can learn 50 human words, then devs can learn 50 HTML elements. \nOn another note, not all package managers are made equal. Robbie has been loyal to Yarn for years and is okay with waiting a few minutes for installs. But from Chuck\u2019s operations perspective, when you\u2019re talking about continuous integration that can eat up a huge chunk of your day, it might be time to look for something that promises speed. \nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie talk about the importance of knowing your HTML elements, the pros and cons of different package managers, and the Whiskey Web and Whatnot NFT drop.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[02:09] - Why Chuck and Robbie struggle to find time for reading.\n\n[04:43] - A whiskey review - Huling Station.\n\n[12:27] - How many HTML elements can Chuck and Robbie name.\n\n[26:25] - How to choose the right package manager.\n\n[41:27] - Chuck and Robbie\u2019s eventful trips.\n\n[56:14] - Whiskey Web and Whatnot\u2019s NFT drop.\n\n\u00a0\nQuotes\n[03:32] - \u201cYou can fit in anything that you prioritize, right? If you said working out is the same as eating, it has to be done. You would find time.\u201d ~ @rwwagner90\n[26:38] - \u201cI think HTML is real, and it hasn't been the first-class citizen that it deserves in terms of the Internet itself, whose intention was to distribute documents and have that accessible across schools and scientific organizations and whatever else. So let's not forget what it was all about, especially if you have a content site. Give your content first-class citizenship.\u201d\u00a0 ~ @CharlesWthe3rd\n[27:32] - \u201cNPM is the leader in the JavaScript world, although it has its proponents and opponents. Many people have jumped over to Yarn for some of its benefits over a period of time, and some of its features influenced NPM and bring people back and forth a little bit.\u201d ~ @CharlesWthe3rd\n\nLinks\n\nCharlie Gerard\n\nJava Script\n\nHuling Station\n\nNational Geographic\n\nSiri\n\nWaze\n\nOld Domonic\u2019s\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nSeelbach\u2019s\n\nNuxt\n\nJSX\n\nReact\n\nNPM\n\nYarn\n\nGithub\n\nEmber\n\njQuery\n\nVercel\n\nJSON\n\nBun\n\nSupabase\n\nFirebase\n\nRedwood\n\nPostgres\n\nDirecTV\n\nRon Burgundy\n\nSea World\n\nBlack Fin\n\nDisneyland\n\nDisney World\n\nChuck E.

Since its inception, many developers have leaned on Orbit, including those at Ship Shape.\u00a0\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie talk with Dan about Orbit\u2019s origin story, the best (and least obvious) ways to use Orbit, why Dan chose platform-agnostic, what he really thinks about Starbeam, his ultimate goal with Orbit, and Dan\u2019s all-time favorite power tool.\u00a0\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[00:45] - A brief intro to Dan.\u00a0\n\n[03:02] - A whiskey review - Nikka Single Malt Miyagikyo.\u00a0\n\n[11:04] - Why Dan created Orbit.\u00a0\n\n[15:47] - Unexpected use cases for Orbit.\u00a0\n\n[21:42] - How Orbit flags a conflict.\u00a0\n\n[25:33] - Orbit\u2019s use cases outside of JSON:API.\n\n[32:46] - What Dan thinks about Starbeam.\u00a0\n\n[35:12] - How Dan escapes his computer.\u00a0\n\n[40:32] - Dan\u2019s favorite power tool.\u00a0\n\n[42:33] - Dan\u2019s thoughts on New Hampshire (and New Jersey).\n\n[48:46] - Dan\u2019s closing thoughts and his sneak peek at a new release.\u00a0\n\n\nQuotes\n[13:28] - \u201cSometimes building for the hard case first also helps clarify the simple case and I think that Orbit really scales from the very simple to the very complex set of requirements.\u201d ~ @dgeb\n[17:47] - \u201cThat\u2019s one of my favorite aspects of working with Orbit is using it as simply as possible to just prototype an app really quickly.\u201d ~ @dgeb\n[33:32] - \u201cThe frameworks have too long been siloed and we are now seeing some really interesting cross framework solutions out there, whether you\u2019re talking about Starbeam or even something like Remix or Astro.\u201d ~ @dgeb\n\nLinks\n\nDan Gebhardt\n\nEmber Core Team Emeritus\n\nJSON:API\n\nOrbit.js\n\nTilde\u00a0\n\nRuby On Rails\n\nRust\n\nYehuda Katz\n\nJSONAPI::Resources\n\nNikka Single Malt Miyagikyo\n\nNikka From The Barrel\n\nThe Glencairn Whiskey Glass\n\nThe Norlan Whiskey Glass\n\nGraphQL\n\nIndexedDB\n\nEmber Data\n\nSwach\n\nGit\n\nApollo\u00a0\n\nWhiskey Web and Whatnot: Discovering Ember, Adopting Orbit, and Unlocking Optimization with Chris Thoburn (runspired)\u00a0\n\nLinkedIn\n\nember-m3\n\nHooks\n\nReact\n\nEric Elliott\u00a0\n\n@glimmer/tracking\n\nStarbeam\n\nAstro\n\nSvelte\n\nView\n\nRedwoodJS\n\nNext.js\n\nAcquia\n\nWhiskey Web and Whatnot: Next.js 12, React vs. Svelte, and the Future of Frameworks with Wes Bos\n\n\nD.C.

But a recent post by Cory Brown about async/await led to an uproar and even messages of pity from Hacker News. Who knew a simple post about pattern preferences would cause such controversy?\u00a0\nToday, Cory\u2019s here to explain his side of the story for those happily using async/await in various concurrency patterns. Luckily, Cory believes, to each their own, and even welcomes responses from developers like Eric Elliott and Robbie as important food for thought. So which universe do you prefer?

Following curiosity and a three-week bootcamp, Tracy was hooked and ready to take on a career in coding.\nToday, Tracy is the CEO of This Dot Labs. She leads a team of 50 developers with a focus on reactive programming, web performance, and developer experience. Her clients and colleagues have become her closest friends and she\u2019s always looking to help fellow developers expand their careers. When she\u2019s not running an agency, Tracy is part of the RX Core Team (one of her many professional memberships), posting tech content to social media, and raising a new baby boy. So how does she manage it all?\u00a0\nIn this episode, Tracy talks with Chuck and Robbie about wearing every hat under the sun and wearing them well, why she loves RxJS, having hard conversations with over-eager developers, what\u2019s so often ignored by non-technical CEOs, and what keeps Tracy motivated above all else.\u00a0\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[00:09] - A Cinco De Mayo-themed beverage review.\u00a0\n\n[02:47] - An intro to Tracy.\n\n[06:17] - What RxJS is used for.\u00a0\n\n[09:28] - How Tracy balances everything.\n\n[18:55] - Tracy\u2019s life outside of coding, parenting, and business ownership.\u00a0\n\n[27:17] - How Tracy first got into web development.\u00a0\n\n[38:23] - Tracy\u2019s advice for developers and the hardest pill to swallow when you\u2019re over-eager.\u00a0\n\n[45:05] - An important conversation about whiskey and Tracy\u2019s liquor cabinet.\u00a0\n\n\nQuotes\n[08:24] - \u201cCheck out RxJS if you have not checked out RxJS. And then if you like it, I think it takes people a little bit to wrap their heads around it because it\u2019s a new way of thinking, but once people do I feel like people just want to RxJS all the things.\u201d ~ @ladyleet\u00a0\n[15:19] - \u201cI hope I can turn my life into only doing my hobby again. So that\u2019s my goal.

Chuck and Robbie have mixed feelings on both monorepus and Shiba Inu tokens and they\u2019re probably not the only ones conflicted. Developer tools and the metaverse are complex topics that don\u2019t always yield solidly positive or negative results.\u00a0\nThe beauty of our ever-evolving digital space is the ability to continually iterate and learn from what\u2019s not working. Having said that, just because something is new (and trending on Twitter) doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best tool for the job, nor that it should be used for anything besides its original purpose. Between monorepos and digital coins, sometimes the hype outweighs the benefit.\u00a0\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie discuss their thoughts on monorepos, the downside to trending languages and developer tools, why the metaverse should be approached with caution, plus a whatnot covering everything under the sun.\u00a0\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[01:22] - A brief whatnot on SNOOs and Robbie\u2019s status as a new parent.\n\n[02:55] - A whiskey review.\n\n[12:29] - Why Robbie can\u2019t wrap his head around monorepos.\u00a0\n\n[28:20] - Why Robbie is (semi) entrenched in the metaverse.\u00a0\n\n[34:21] - Chuck and Robbie\u2019s take on the Oscar slap and the future of comedy.\n\n[37:16] - A less serious whatnot about podcasts, electric cars, entertainment, and new babies.\u00a0\n\n\nQuotes\n[21:43] - \u201cI think that there\u2019s good practice in saying \u2018why?\u2019 But I don\u2019t think everything should always be one way. I think that [you should] just use the best tool for the job when you come across that.\u201d ~ @CharlesWthe3rd\n[22:04] - \u201cThere are cases where monorepo could work and be good for people. I\u2019m not saying they suck all the time. It\u2019s my argument with everything \u2014 people use React because they think it\u2019s cool, people use TypeScript because they think it\u2019s the hotness, we need to type everything.

Plus, he\u2019s learned from experience that becoming emotionally attached to whatever you\u2019re using is a dangerous game.\u00a0\nIn this episode, Chris talks with Chuck and Robbie about a lack of resources and corporate greed in open source, the framework eras we\u2019ve lived through and what\u2019s to come, why workers are incredible, choosing a career path, and how to keep developing as a developer.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[00:23] - Introducing Chris and his recent good news.\n\n[03:20] - An heirloom whiskey review.\u00a0\n\n[10:12] - Why Chris left LinkedIn and what he\u2019s up to now.\u00a0\n\n[17:20] - What Chris learned from React.\n\n[18:58] - A chat about Classes, Functions, and Tailwind.\n\n[26:20] - What goes awry with execution in open source.\n\n[34:33] - Why open source is not sustainable and a brief history of the framework eras.\n\n[40:40] - Why Bitski has moved away from Ember.\u00a0\n\n[46:49] - What Chris thinks about Web3.\u00a0\n\n[53:37] - A DC, Disney, and Cars-themed whatnot.\u00a0\n\n\nQuotes\n[14:33] - \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve worked with JavaScript for 10 years now and I don\u2019t ever want to become one of those one-language devs. So I would like to be able to transition away from JavaScript at some point. Or at least transition into being able to work in multiple languages\u201d ~ @pzuraq\n[28:51] - \u201cWe built these primitives so that anybody can do it. Anybody can go and build that functionality. You don\u2019t need to RFC it to Ember. You don\u2019t need to have it be accepted by the core team.\u201d ~ @pzuraq\n[44:06] - \u201cI didn\u2019t understand workers at first. I didn\u2019t understand that it fundamentally changes the dynamics of writing web applications.\u201d ~ @pzuraq\n\nLinks\n\nChris Garrett\n\nChris on Twitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nGoogle\n\nLaws San Luis Straight Rye Whiskey\u00a0\n\n\nNetflix\u00a0\n\nABC Stores\n\nRob Jackson\n\nTom Dale\n\nDave Hermin\n\nDavid Hamilton\n\nChris Krycho\n\nBitski\u00a0\n\n\nTicketfly\u00a0\n\nJulian Tescher\u00a0\n\nPatrick Tescher\n\n\nRust\u00a0\n\nJavaScript\n\nWasm\n\nReact\n\nView\n\nSvelte\n\nHooks\n\nElm\n\nTailwind CSS\n\nEmber.js\u00a0\n\nGlimmer.js\n\nJSX\n\nREPL JS\n\nJest\n\nFacebook\n\nRed Hat\n\nCypress\n\nNativeScript\n\nVercel\u00a0\n\nNext JS\n\nFaker.js\n\nOpenSSL\n\nHenry Zhu\n\nBabel\n\nAngular\n\nBackbone.js\n\nKnockout\u00a0\n\nRails\n\nMeteor\n\nApollo Studio\n\nSvelteKit\u00a0\n\nEmber Core Team\n\nRich Harris\n\nRemix\u00a0\n\nCloudflare Workers\n\nEdgeWorkers\n\nNetlify\n\nWeb3\n\nKevin Rose\n\nApple\n\nGary Vaynerchuk\n\nCandy\n\nEthereum\n\nCoinbase\u00a0\n\nRECUR\n\nNFTU\n\nember-shepherd\n\nNational Cherry Blossom Festival\n\nNational Geographic\n\nThe Owl House\n\n\nConnect with our hosts\n\nRobbie Wagner\n\nChuck Carpenter\n\nShip Shape\n\n\nSubscribe and stay in touch\n\nApple Podcasts\n\nSpotify\n\nGoogle Podcasts\n\nWhiskey Web and Whatnot\n\n\nTop-Tier, Full-Stack Software Consultants\nThis show is brought to you by Ship Shape.

But not everyone\u2019s been coding since their early college days like Robbie and Chuck. Kara Luton started on track to become a professional ballerina. After college and a stint in music publicity, burnout prompted Kara to make a hard left and begin a career in tech.\u00a0\nWith all the developer bootcamps and online resources now available, making the switch has never been more accessible. Not to mention, the skills Kara learned as a ballerina and a music publicist helped shape the developer she is today. From staying dedicated and detail-oriented, learning to write and learning from burnout, Kara wouldn\u2019t change anything about her unconventional path to software.\nIn this episode, Chuck and Robbie talk with Kara about her experience learning and relearning Ember, why she loves the Ember community, her advice for those looking to switch careers, Kara\u2019s cool home office, and why every developer has something valuable to offer.\u00a0\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[00:58] - A brief introduction to Kara.\u00a0\n\n[03:16] - A whiskey review.\u00a0\n\n[08:51] - Kara\u2019s non-traditional path to tech.\u00a0\n\n[15:57] - Kara\u2019s experience in a bootcamp and her thoughts on bootcamps as a developer launchpad.\n\n[17:34] - How Kara found Ember.\u00a0\n\n[23:10] - Kara\u2019s advice for people looking to make a career pivot.\n\n[28:44] - Why Kara\u2019s looking forward to contributing to open source projects.\u00a0\n\n[32:30] - How Kara\u2019s home office setup has evolved.\u00a0\n\n[37:57] - Kara\u2019s thoughts on NFTs.\u00a0\n\n[40:17] - Why Kara loves animals and a deep dive on her two pet dogs.\u00a0\n\n[47:48] - More of Kara\u2019s hobbies outside of the web and a chat about Marvel movies.\u00a0\n\n[58:48] - A soccer and sports-themed whatnot.\u00a0\n\n\nQuotes\n[15:20] - \u201cBallet, it\u2019s very detail-oriented and I feel like that\u2019s something that\u2019s really helped me in my career as a developer, like missing a semicolon or understanding the different syntaxes \u2014 it\u2019s really helped me a lot.

Juan Palomino, founder of Full Speed Media, has spent the last year knee-deep in his own NFT experiment. Along the way, he\u2019s learned what to embrace and what to forget when it comes to making his mark in the digital economy.\u00a0\nJuan started Full Speed Media as a way to provide live streaming services throughout the pandemic. While it began as a way to simply satisfy a growing demand, through his business, Juan began developing relationships with local organizations in Phoenix and realized the need for other web-based projects geared toward fundraising.\u00a0\nA true lover of building cool stuff and experimenting with the latest tech trends, Juan eventually developed an NFT drop in partnership with a local artist. Since launch day, his community has minted almost 100 tokens and raised just under $10,000 for the Valleywise Health Foundation, the largest provider of mental health services in Arizona.\u00a0\nIn this episode, Robbie, Chuck, and Juan discuss the technicalities of building an NFT, where most developers miss the mark in blockchain, and the real beauty of a growing minted marketplace.\u00a0\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n[01:13] - A quick introduction to Juan.\n\n[02:37] - Two truths and a lie.\u00a0\n\n[06:25] - A whiskey review.\u00a0\n\n[14:19] - Chuck's two truths and a brief history of Philadelphia.\u00a0\n\n[17:54] - Juan\u2019s groundbreaking NFT fundraising project.\u00a0\n\n[23:17] - How tech trends like NFTs and smart contracts actually work.\u00a0\n\n[27:11] - How Juan algorithmically generates NFT images.\n\n[31:20] - The right way to approach NFTs and why fees.wtf missed the mark.\u00a0\n\n[45:40] - What\u2019s the deal with DAOs?\u00a0\n\n[46:50] - Where the blockchain truly belongs.\n\n[49:06] - Why Chuck is back on Twitter.\u00a0\n\n[52:13] - The beauty of the NFT space.\u00a0\n\n\nQuotes\n[41:31] - \u201cBlockchain in itself is not this secret ingredient that now makes everything better. It has become this buzzword that people want to do a land grab for but realistically, this is just the building blocks of how we\u2019re going to build bigger, better, more decentralized, more trustless applications and systems.\u201d ~ @JuanForTheMoney\n[52:47] - \u201cThe NFT space, for all its quirks and mishappenings and lost gas fees, has really turned me onto the art world and has exposed me to a whole different way of creating stuff and connected me with a lot of people I might not have been connected with otherwise. If nothing else, it has been a really great experiment.\u201d ~ @JuanForTheMoney\n\nLinks\n\nJuan on Twitter\n\nFull Speed Media\n\nSi Se Puede Foundation\n\nSmooth Ambler\n\nLost Lantern Smooth Ambler West Virginia Straight Bourbon Whiskey\n\nSeelbach\u2019s\n\nCoffee Zona\n\nGeno\u2019s Steaks\n\nLin Manuel Miranda\n\nEncanto\n\nViva Muertos!\n\nValleywise Health Foundation\n\nValleywise Emerging Leaders Program\n\nLalo Cota\n\nEthereum\n\nKent C.
