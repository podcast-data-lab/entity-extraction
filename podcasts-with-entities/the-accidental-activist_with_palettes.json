    "description": "For acclaimed journalist Isha Sesay, being surrounded by news of activism was the norm. But becoming an activist herself was never a role she envisioned\u2014until now. In this series, Isha sits down with an array of cultural icons who have also found themselves unexpectedly inhabiting a role as \u201cactivist.\u201d She explores the motivating circumstances behind their passions, all while revealing the human condition that unites us all: a desire to make a difference in the world.",

White Picket Fence interrogates the structures of inequity affecting women since America\u2019s founding. On the newest season, host Julie Kohler investigates mothers as a political force \u2014 how motherhood has been utilized for political gain and why the identity of \u201cmother\u201d remains so politically potent. \n\nIn the fall of 2020, a group of mothers gathered around a kitchen table. They were concerned that public school administrators were making decisions about their children's health and education that overstepped their bounds. It felt like they were losing control over their kids. So they decided to band together and fight for their parental rights. Pretty compelling, right? It's hard to argue with moms. The GOP knows that. And that's why they've weaponized our reverence for motherhood by propping up Moms for Liberty \u2014 the \u201cgrassroots\u201d organization that\u2019s leading the charge in the culture wars in American public schools.\n\nWhite Picket Fence's cover art features a photograph by Jonathan Wilkins.\n\nWhite Picket Fence is supported by Planned Parenthood.
