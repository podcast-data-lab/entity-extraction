However, it was not always a walk in the park for Steve. In this interview, Steve paints a picture of his upbringing as a Korean immigrant, his transformation from being a devout atheist, the founding of Little Lights, and the work he currently does today during the global pandemic.\n\u00a0\nAs we\u00a0delve into his work in racial reconciliation and his Race Literacy 101 class, Steve reminds us how Korean Americans can do better and play a significant role in the national conversations around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity (DEI).\n\u00a0\nDonate at https://councilka.org/donate\nListen to past episodes at https://councilka.org/podcast-series\n"

Last season we talk with politicians, musicians, philanthropists and entrepreneurs.

Looking ahead, we'll be kicking off the season with the release of three interview shows. One with celebrated pianist and music educator, Alpin Hong; the second, innovation corporate trainer, Monica Kang; and finally third, shame and vulnerability research expert and mental health counselor, Julia Park. Then each week afterwards we'll be releasing new episodes. I don't think the timing could have been better during this time of COVID-19 and all the uncertainties. I know many of you are indoors with your families and friends or perhaps just alone and as you exercise social distancing, this'll be a great time for you to listen to our many shows that are coming online. We're sending all of our love to you and we wish you safety, health, and also a bit of sanity.\u00a0</p>\r\n",

Looking ahead, we'll be kicking off the season with the release of three interview shows. One with celebrated pianist and music educator, Alpin Hong; the second, innovation corporate trainer, Monica Kang; and finally third, shame and vulnerability research expert and mental health counselor, Julia Park. Then each week afterwards we'll be releasing new episodes. I don't think the timing could have been better during this time of COVID-19 and all the uncertainties. I know many of you are indoors with your families and friends or perhaps just alone and as you exercise social distancing, this'll be a great time for you to listen to our many shows that are coming online. We're sending all of our love to you and we wish you safety, health, and also a bit of sanity.\u00a0"

            "contentSnippet": "The pilot episode of our new podcast Korean American Perspectives features Congressman Andy Kim, the first Korean American member of Congress in over 20 years. Despite the Congressman's busy schedule, CKA Senior Director Jessica Lee was able to sit down with Congressman Kim for a brief but inspiring conversation. As a representative of New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District, Congressman Kim constantly puts the people of his district first and is a champion of affordable healthcare in an era \"where 40% of Americans can't handle a $400 emergency\". From his Korean American upbringing to his journey running for Congress, Congressman Kim reminds us of the importance of civic engagement and what is at stake for the Korean American community if our voices are not heard.",
