                "summary": "\n        <p>On last week's Rework podcast, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, co-founders of 37signals, joined host Kimberly Rhodes to answer <a href=\"https://37signals.com/podcast/listener-questions-ama/\">listener questions </a>about their approach to design, decision-making, and more.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, they return to tackle more listener questions, covering a diverse range of topics such as delegating projects, hiring, and remote work.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen in as they discuss their strategies for helping team members take ownership of their work and their tips on deploying projects. They also offer advice on attracting and retaining the right talent and discuss the role of communication and culture in building a successful team.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Show Notes:\u00a0</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[00:26] - Sarah McKenzie asks for tips on delegating projects rather than tasks and helping team members take ownership of their work areas as she wants to move in this direction with her small team.</p><p>[01:23] - Jason explains how <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/jason/delegating-projects-not-tasks-f36cb8bc\">Basecamp delegates projects instead of tasks</a>. In contrast, team members are given a rough general idea of the project and some ideas for the interface design, and they figure out how to get it done in their own time.</p><p>[02:57] - David adds that even new employees and junior programmers can handle owning a whole project.</p><p>[04:38] - David shares that <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup\"><em>Shape Up's</em></a> idea of a fixed time frame and flexible scope interlocks with delegating projects.</p><p>[05:32] - Let people live up to high expectations and see who does it quickly and best. Delegating a project means evaluating work based on outcomes, not effort, allowing team members to make decisions and run autonomously within the project's scope.\u00a0</p><p>[06:28] - Julio Caesar from Sao Paulo, Brazil, asks DHH about the day-to-day work in a team of two, specifically about code review, pull requests, and dev to production deployments. He's concerned about the time wasted in long change management meetings and how to avoid having someone who doesn't know anything about the project approve a deploy.</p><p>[07:11] - 37signals has teams of two working on different aspects of a product, with any given feature having a designer and a programmer working on it.</p><p>[08:24] - David shares that the company has a process where someone is responsible for the quality of the work that goes out the door. There is a mentorship process for new hires. Programmers and designers review each other's work.</p><p>[08:40] - In the <a href=\"https://37signals.com/seven-shipping-principles/\">Seven Shipping Principles</a>, there is a notion that if the person is confident that the deploy is low-risk, they are not obligated to get a review. Even CTOs and senior employees sometimes request a review to increase their confidence. The team encourages individuals to have a strong sense of confidence and delegate the responsibility of reviews to themselves.</p><p>[09:22] - The review process is asynchronous and shouldn't be a blocker.</p><p>[10:29] - Jason shares that although anyone can deploy work, the company has never had a catastrophic deploy in its history. And rollbacks are very rare.</p><p>[12:38] - A mystery caller asks David and Jason if they have any rules, constraints, or systems in place to help them decide when to grow and when not to grow, specifically around headcount and staffing.</p><p>[13:02] - Jason explains that their hiring is department-based and based on specific needs rather than global goals. They follow the principle of \"hire when it hurts\" and aim to alleviate actual pain rather than future pain.\u00a0</p><p>[15:16] - Having two people is better than one\u2014David shares an example where they had only one person in a role, and it was difficult for them to take a vacation or sabbatical without affecting the company. He also suggests that companies should consider redefining a role when someone leaves rather than simply refilling it and only hiring when necessary.</p><p>[17:54] - Jason emphasizes the importance of the \"hire when it hurts\" principle, especially for startups. He advises it's better to wait for reality to show what is actually needed before making hiring decisions.</p><p>[19:15] - Jason and David discuss the practice of hiring defensively, which involves hoarding talent and contributes to the malaise of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Jobs-Theory-David-Graeber/dp/150114331X?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=kimberlynot0c-20&amp;linkId=9331d6c23ca4b609e34b9b03e43c29ef&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\"><em>Bullshit Jobs</em></a>.</p><p>[21:06] - David talks about his experience of having a job where it didn't matter if he did anything and the cruelty of putting people in that position, not to mention the ding on the economy.\u00a0</p><p>[23:23] - Listener Bhagyesh asks how to find team members that align with work principles and help the business grow without traditional supervision.</p><p>[23:48] - Jason says they find team members through word of mouth and by writing detailed job ads. They get many applications per role but narrow them down by talking to candidates and having them do a small project.</p><p>[25:50]- David stresses the importance of finding someone who matches their principles by incorporating them into the ad. They have been promoting <a href=\"https://37signals.com/books/#remote\"><em>Remote</em></a> work for decades, which helps them find the right people and hire talent from all over the world.</p><p>[28:35] - Kimberly highlights the importance of the tone of the job description. As a previous candidate, she notes that it gives people a sense of the company's culture.</p><p>[29:01] - 37signals' job ads accurately describe the place and give people a sense of how they communicate, which is a big part of attracting the right people.</p><p>[29:33] - Do you have questions for David and Jason about a better way to work and run your business?

The product itself is their design system.\u00a0</p><p>[03:07] - As with Basecamp and <a href=\"https://www.hey.com/\">Hey,</a> design consistency can emerge naturally.</p><p>[03:30] - David shares that large organizations typically use design systems to standardize processes.\u00a0</p><p>[05:34] - Why it makes sense for individual designers to have ownership over the design process for small teams like 37signals.</p><p>[06:52] - Listener Paul asks how David and Jason resolve conflicts and make difficult decisions.</p><p>[07:02] - Jason explains conflicts are rare among the team and shares how they handle the things they don't agree on (without keeping score).\u00a0</p><p>[08:18] - Why it's important to remember most decisions are temporary. \u00a0</p><p>[08:59] - Jason shares an example of the rare occurrences when they might battle.

In this follow-up episode to <a href=\"https://37signals.com/podcast/leaving-the-cloud/\"><em>Leaving the Cloud </em>on <em>REWORK</em></a>, co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson and Director of Operations Eron Nicholson discuss the progress 37signals has made since they decided to leave the cloud.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Listen in as they delve into the pros and cons of using the cloud versus owning your hardware and some of the misconceptions people have about cloud costs and expertise.\u00a0</p><p>Tune in as the pair shares insights from their experience running web applications at scale and offer advice, tips, and tools for startups and businesses looking to optimize their infrastructure.\u00a0</p><p>Join the discussion as they explore the importance of getting real about the costs of the cloud for small businesses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Show Notes:\u00a0</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[00:49] - David reflects on the progress made since the announcement to transition off of cloud services. And why their initial plan for help with the transition didn't work for 37signals' needs.\u00a0</p><p>[01:37] - How the experience with the failed deal to get help with the cloud transition reinforced the idea of why 37signals wanted to leave the cloud.</p><p>[02:33] - David shares some tools that can be used to move out of the cloud, including Docker and Kubernetes.\u00a0</p><p>[04:21] - Why 37signals opted for a new tool they built called MRSK to assist in their transition and their timeline for being entirely out of the cloud.</p><p>[06:11] - Bleeding money: The $38,000 motivator to speed up the timeline and free up cash that could be better spent elsewhere in the business.</p><p>[08:33] - The tools: Eron and David discuss the tools (Docker and MRSK) they've used to successfully move two apps, Tadalist and Writeboard, from the cloud to their new system and the template in place for moving the rest of their apps.\u00a0</p><p>[11:08] - David discusses the criticality ladder they have in place to prioritize their move off the cloud, beginning with the lowest criticality app (Tadalist) before moving on to higher criticality apps like Hey, which deals with email and must always be available to users.</p><p>[13:23] - The app transition plan for the next few months.</p><p>[13:58] - Eron explains the challenges of staffing up for a project of this magnitude. He also highlights how many of their current AWS-related processes will become streamlined once they have their own infrastructure.</p><p>[16:00] - David shares what the cloud is great for, why it doesn't work great for middle-range SaaS companies, and the main reasons for 37signals for bringing their infrastructure back in-house.</p><p>[19:31] - Eron explains their advantage in moving back to their own infrastructure and why he hopes that their experience will encourage others to consider moving away from the cloud as well.</p><p>[20:24] - Blowing the notion that the cloud is the only option to smithereens: David reflects on the lost knowledge of running your own hardware and the vendors who can help.\u00a0</p><p>[23:17] - Eron shares how you can lease from vendors like Deft, Digital Ocean, or Hetzner until it makes sense for you to buy your own servers.</p><p>[23:46] - David discusses the importance of exploring alternatives to AWS, breaking the misconception that the cloud is the only option, and exploring the most cost-effective solution for your company.\u00a0</p><p>[26:04] - David responds to a comment suggesting they could have saved money by optimizing cloud costs and the possibly \"crippling\" variability of cloud costs that is a major concern for smaller companies\u2014a risk eliminated by owning your own hardware. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LL1cV2FXZ5I\">Watch David's YouTube video on MRSK</a>.</p><p>[27:57] - Eron explains how they worked to optimize their cloud spend using every single lever at their disposal within AWS, but despite all that effort, they still found that running their own hardware is more cost-effective than using the cloud.</p><p>[28:48] - Do you have a question for Jason, David, or anyone at 37signals?

During our hiatus, we'll be playing some vintage episodes of the 37signals Podcast, a show that Basecamp ran from 2009-2011 (and then forgot all about until Wailin came across the show during an unrelated Google search). In this episode, Basecamp (then 37signals) co-founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson discuss a satirical press release they wrote to skewer overblown tech company valuations. That leads to a broader discussion about investment, exits, and serial entrepreneurship."

The book is a culmination of Ryan's 15+ years working at Basecamp and explains how small teams of designers and programmers can ship great work in six-week cycles. Ryan's book is about product development and software, but many of its ideas around working with the right level of abstraction, embracing constraints, and making smart bets are applicable to other creative pursuits."
