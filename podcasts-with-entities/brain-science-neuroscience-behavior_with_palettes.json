In this episode, Mireille and Adam discuss the neurophysiological underpinnings of our sense of touch and how our brains process these sensory experiences. According to David Linden, Ph.D., Professor of Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, \u201cThe sense of touch is intrinsically emotional.\u201d Not only is touch relevant to our emotional experience, but it is a foundational aspect of the development of our nervous system and it impacts how we manage stress and respond to pain. It isn\u2019t surprising then to consider that touch is also extremely relevant to our relationships as we are apt to feel more connected to those with whom we engage in touch. "

This is a way in which we can \u201cbuild\u201d our skill in terms of having empathy for others. Seek to understand, not judge.\nHave REGARD for others\u2019 experiences \u2013 this is evidence of respect. It is easy to use ourselves to make sense of what we don\u2019t know; therefore, we need to learn how to consider the direction of the \u201clens\u201d we use.\nCollaboration as a key component of respect and empathy. How do we make sense of others\u2019 perspectives or experiences?\nChallenges with feedback from others:\nInvalidation ==> telling someone that they shouldn\u2019t feel or think what they do, in fact, think or feel.\nWe are apt to struggle with an undercurrent of distrust in one\u2019s self when we get feedback like this from others.\nIndicator lights of having difficulty giving respect, empathy, or compassion with ourselves and others.\nArguing or poor communication\nDepression (cognitive rigidity)\nGuilt as reflection of giving something I don\u2019t have to give or not giving someone what they want\nAnxiety (chaos)\nWe can acquire and cultivate the skills of respect, empathy, and compassion. We don\u2019t improve any skill we don\u2019t practice. How can we do things differently relationally?\nCreate clear expectations for ourselves and others. Use clarity to help manage these differently\nCo-operate with others\nDr. John Gottman\u2019s 4 horsemen in (marital/couple) relationships:\nCriticism - negative judgments in absolute terms\nDefensiveness - avoiding responsibility or blaming others\nContempt - a fundamental sense of disrespect, ridicule or disgust. Name calling \u2013 erodes the fabric of a relationship. (ex. mean-spirited sarcasm or eye rolling) **This is the most problematic in a relationship.\nStonewalling - putting a wall between you and your partner\nBeing able to identify the Four Horsemen in your conflict discussions is a necessary first step to eliminating them, but this knowledge is not enough. To drive away destructive communication and conflict patterns, you must replace them with healthy, productive ones.\nFortunately, each horseman has a proven positive behavior that will counteract negativity.\nThis infographic highlights some of Dr. John Gottman\u2019s most notable research findings on marriage and couple relationships.\nWhat\u2019s a good action plan for change? Self-awareness is key place to start.\nSomething missing or broken? PRs welcome!",
