    "description": "A slightly skewed look at life through the lens of three radio presenters in Nairobi, Kenya. Every week G Money, Calvin and Andy Young chop it up on topics that they probably have no expertise in, but some how it works! The Mics Are Open is a random journey that meanders through three very different lives. These guys are so good, you might even think that they are friends in real life!
