Once they do, they notice something that no one has ever noticed before, a force of nature that helped shape modern human history and that is eerily similar to what\u2019s happening on our planet right now. With help from pirates, astronomers and an 80-year-old bartender, this episode will change the way you look at the sun. (Warning: Do not look at the sun.)\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Scott St George, Nathaniel Millett, Michael Charles Stambaugh, Justin Maxwell, Clay Tucker, Willem Klooster, Kevin Anchukaitis</em></p>\n<p>EPISODE CREDITS</p>\n<p>Reported by - Latif Nasserwith help from - Ekedi Fausther-Keeys and Maria Paz GutierrezProduced by - Maria Paz Gutierrez and Pat Walterswith help from - Ekedi Fausther-Keeys and Sachi MulkeyMixed by -\u00a0Jeremy Bloomwith mixing help from - Arianne WackFact-checking by - Natalie Middletonand Edited by\u00a0 - Pat Walters</p>\n<p>CITATIONS:</p>\n<p>Books:\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12044/tree-story\"><em>Tree Story</em></a> (<a href=\"https://zpr.io/ULX279uzgW9q\">https://zpr.io/ULX279uzgW9q</a>) by Valerie Trouet<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/322123/sweetness-and-power-by-sidney-w-mintz/\"><em>Sweetness and Power</em></a> (<a href=\"https://zpr.io/cUEGqGGWMSaQ\">https://zpr.io/cUEGqGGWMSaQ</a>) by Sidney Mintz</p>\n<p><em>Our newsletter comes out every Wednesday.

Surya was not your typical figure skater: she is black, she is athletic, and she didn\u2019t seem to care about artistry. Her performances\u2014punctuated by triple jumps and other power moves\u2014thrilled audiences around the world. Yet commentators claimed she couldn\u2019t skate and judges never gave her high marks.

And in these competitions, riders have to bring everything they need to complete epic bike rides totally by themselves. They pack all the supplies they think they\u2019ll need to survive, and have to refuse some of the simplest, subtlest, most intangible boosts that exist in our world. But a leader has emerged in this sport. Her name is Lael Wilcox, and she\u2019s a total rockstar in the world of competitive bikepacking. She\u2019s broken all kinds of records. And also, some rules. Most recently, on this one ride she did across the entire state of Arizona. We set out to find out what it means \u2014 for Cat, for Lael, and for any of us \u2014 to endure incredibly hard things, totally alone. The answer is on the course, in our bodies, and hidden in that mysterious place between us and the people we care about. Special thanks to Anna Haslock, Nico Sandi, Michael Fryar, Moab Public Radio, Nichole Baker and Payson McElveen for sharing their studio with us, and The Radavist, for letting us use the audio of Lael\u2019s ride across Arizona.

We hear how a recurring dream about football turned into a real-life lesson for Stephen Dubner, we watch a chessboard turn into a playground where by-the-book moves give way to totally unpredictable possibilities, and we talk to Dan Engber, a one time senior editor at Slate, now at The Atlantic, and a bunch of scientists about why betting on a longshot is so much fun. And finally, we talk to Malcolm Gladwell about why he loves the overdog. CITATIONS: Videos -\u00a0 The Immaculate Reception\u00a0(https://zpr.io/izhV3Sm88SWF) by Franco Harris on December 23, 1972.

She\u2019s been working on a book called <em>Butts, a Backstory</em> and in this episode, she tells us about a fascinating history she uncovered that takes us from a eugenicist\u2019s attempt in the late 1930s to concretize the most average human, to the rise of the garment industry, and the pain and shame we often feel today when we go looking for a pair of pants that actually fit.</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to\u00a0Alexandra Primiani and Jordan Rodman</em></p>\n<p>Episode Credits:Reported by Heather RadkeProduced by Matt KieltyOriginal music and sound design contributed by Matt Kielty and Jeremy BloomMixing by Jeremy BloomFact-checking by Emily Krieger</p>\n<p>Citations:You can Pre-order Heather\u2019s book \u201cButts: A Backstory\u201d <a href=\"https://zpr.io/QVFVLTTW9vpN\">here</a> (https://zpr.io/QVFVLTTW9vpN)</p>\n<p><em>Our newsletter comes out every Wednesday.

Finally, we hear the story of a blind kid who freed himself from an unhappy childhood by climbing into the telephone system, and bending it to his will.</p>\n<p>Now sit back, relax and enjoy what we hope will prove to be a welcomed Escape.Episode Credits:Reported and produced by\u00a0Pat Walters, Lynn Levy, and Sean Cole</p>\n\n<p><em>Leadership support for Radiolab\u2019s science programming is provided by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Science Sandbox, a Simons Foundation Initiative, and the John Templeton Foundation.

When he started going up against fast-talking, well-funded, \u201cname-brand\u201d teams, from places like Northwestern and Harvard, it was clear he wasn\u2019t in Kansas anymore. So Ryan became the vanguard of a movement that made everything about debate debatable. In the end, he made himself a home in a strange and hostile land. Whether he was able to change what counts as rigorous academic argument \u2026 well, that\u2019s still up for debate.\nSpecial thanks to Will Baker, Myra Milam, John Dellamore, Sam Mauer, Tiffany Dillard Knox, Mary Mudd, Darren \"Chief\" Elliot, Jodee Hobbs, Rashad Evans and Luke Hill.\u00a0\nSpecial thanks also to Torgeir Kinne Solsvik for use of the song\u00a0h-lydisk / B Lydian from the album\u00a0Geirr Tveitt Piano Works and Songs\nSupport Radiolab by becoming a member of The Lab today.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nRadiolab is on YouTube!

But for a million different reasons she hated that, because she felt different from her in a million different ways. Then, a year ago, an online conspiracy theory claiming Helen was a fraud exploded on TikTok, and suddenly Elsa found herself drawing her sword and jumping to Helen\u2019s defense, setting off a chain of events that would bring her closer to the disability icon than she ever dreamt. For over a year, Elsa, Lulu and the Radiolab team dug through primary sources, talked to experts, even visited Helen\u2019s birthplace Ivy Green, and discovered the real story of Helen Keller is far more complicated, mysterious and confounding than the simple myth of a young Deafblind girl rescued by her teacher Annie Sullivan. It\u2019s a story of ghosts, surprises, a few tears, a bit of romance, some hard conversations, and a possibly psychic dog.<strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><em><span>This episode was reported by Elsa Sjunneson and Lulu Miller.

Imagine getting the commission to write a song that will allow family members to face the death of a loved one. Well, composer David Lang had to do just that when a hospital in Garches, France, asked him to write music for their morgue, or 'Salle Des Departs.' What do you do? This piece was produced by Jocelyn Gonzales. And Latif talks about an episode Jad made in 2009. Here\u2019s how we described it back then: Jad--a brand new father--wonders what's going on inside the head of his baby Amil. (And don't worry, you don't need kids to enjoy this podcast.) The questions here are big: what is it like to be so brand new to the world? None of us have memories from this time, so how could we possibly ever know? Is it just chaos? Or, is there something more, some understanding from the very beginning? Jad found a development psychologist named Charles Fernyhough to explore some of his questions.

And as our staff tried to figure out what to do for our last episode of 2020, co-host Latif Nasser thought, what if we stare straight into the darkness \u2026 and make a damn Christmas special about it.</p>\n<p>Latif begins with a story about Santa, and a back-room deal he made with the Trump administration to jump to the front of the vaccine line, a tale that travels from an absurd quid-pro-quo to a deep question: who really is an essential worker?\u00a0</p>\n<p>From there, we take a whistle-stop tour through the numbers that scientists say you need to know as you wind your way (or preferably, don\u2019t wind your way) through our COVID-infested world.
