Makenna speaks about living close to the land and still being ensnared in the world of capital; the slippage between autofiction, fiction, memoir and nonfiction; how she loves artists who play with the real; and what it might mean to write without assuming dominance over reality,  Rachel and Makenna discuss their mothers, motherhood as a metaphor or lens, the impossibility of living an ethical life and opting out of being an oppressor within capitalism, the shame of realizing progressive utopianism might be just another form of \u201cprivate contentment,\u201d Psyche and Eros, the social construction of vigor, the stories we tell about about ourselves, Agnes Varda and her idea that happiness is joy and pain side by side, why Makenna loves reading short novels by women translated into English from other languages and so much more.

NourbeSe Philip the day after Philip received the 2020 PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature in New York. Rachel begins by asking M. NourbeSe about a line in her acceptance speech: \u201cBeing must be sufficient and not contingent.\u201d They talk about \u201cSawubona,\u201d a greeting used by Zulu and other African cultures, meaning \u201cI see you,\u201d and discuss why M. NourbeSe calls motherhood a form of radical hospitality with organizing principles that stand in critical opposition to those of white supremacy and colonization. M. NourbeSe talks about a healthy distrust of the English language and the impact of a colonial education\u2014for instance, being tested on Wordsworth\u2019s daffodils on her exams when she had never seen one\u2014and the poem she wants to write about Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s golden Poui trees instead. M. NourbeSe also describes the feeling of working at the margins or brink of visible Caribbean literature, writing/living/speaking in a language that is yours but not your ancestors, and how to break open the language in order to express that which cannot be expressed in English. M. NourbeSe explains why she feels like she could only have written She Tries Her Tongue, Her Silence Softly Breaks and Looking for Livingstone in Canada, while also, at times, feeling like a disappeared writer in Canada. Rachel and M. NourbeSe reflect on the role of \u201cdifficulty\u201d in M. NourbeSe\u2019s writing, what is the \u201cright\u201d part/direction of the page, and our capacities to imagine beyond the binary of capitalism and socialism and to imagine freedom and ways of being beyond the constraints of our existing language. \n"

Steinke describes her first hot flash, how she came to be fascinated by female killer whales and how important it is to see the changes associated with menopause not as symptoms of disease but as signs of transitioning into a new phase of leadership and power. Steinke talks about how memoirs by trans writers were especially helpful for her when searching for a book to help her through this life transition. Steinke talks about how she began to think of herself as a creature/animal, back surgery, stuttering, faith, going toward brokenness rather than perfection, her mother, her spiritual practices, singing, the authentic self, and why she doesn\u2019t think trying to stay the same is a very good strategy."

For the first time in Commonplace herstory, the episode is not hosted by Rachel Zucker and is, instead, guided by Commonplace producer and social media director, Doreen Wang. The episode opens with a brief history of Taiwan and is followed by conversations that Rachel and Doreen had with two highly-regarded independent bookstores in the Taipei area.  \n\nAt Brilliant Time Bookstore, they speak with Mr. CHANG Cheng about viewing Taiwan in relationship to its neighboring Southeast Asian countries and in relationship to the many Southeast Asians living inside of Taiwan. They also speak about Mr. CHANG\u2019s lifelong dedication toward building a fair and just society in Taiwan, no matter the island\u2019s future. \nAt FemBooks, Rachel and Doreen speak with its manager LI Xiumei (Sophie) and KANG Min Jay, a professor at National Taiwan University\u2019s Graduate Institute of Building and Planning. Both talk about how they got involved with FemBooks\u2014Sophie, because of her prior history working on gender issues, and Professor Kang, because of his scholarship and activism on public spaces and realizing the unique position of independent bookstores as \u201csemi-public spaces.\u201d They also talk about the influence of Virginia Woolf and the importance of naming (instead of being named).\n\nNote: Capitalized text indicates family names (which precede given names in the Chinese language).  \n\nDoreen Wang has been the voice, mind and heart behind Commonplace\u2019s social media since September 2018. Doreen is a writer\u2014poetry and creative nonfiction, among other genres\u2014and longtime NGO worker who now manages a youth leadership program for the International Network of Engaged Buddhists, and leads food tours in Chengdu. Doreen received a poetry fellowship from Kundiman as well as a Pushcart Prize nomination for her work. You can find her work in On She Goes, Angel\u2019s Flight: Literary West, and Racist Sandwich podcast. An inaugural participant of Spotify\u2019s Sound Up Bootcamp for Women of Color Podcasters, Doreen is working on a writing and audio documentary where she and her grandmother talk story about how the borders of China-Taiwan and U.S.-Mexico have shaped their lives."

Larusso talks about the difficulty of protecting her writing life, her decision to move back to her hometown of Los Angeles, and her decision to be childfree.

Boyer talks about a recent dream she had, the motivating fires of vengeance and love, and how to keep the door to hell open long enough to write one word at a time despite the disabling physical and emotional effects of cancer treatment. Zucker and Boyer discuss what happens when poets face the larger market, trusting readers, how to break out of the pressure to perform certain modes of self-expression, a feminist future where there can be more than one smart woman in a room, the pornography of authenticity, the relationship between poiesis and critique and why it\u2019s important to resist the allure of criticism, resisting the pressure to create spectacles of suffering, how to find the least-alienating way to be inside alienating structures, the problem with pink-ribbon culture, the shortcomings of \u201cempowerment feminism,\u201d what real solidarity might look like, why Boyer loves to write but hates to publish and hates the work of being public, harassment and abuse in the literary world, and Tolstoy\u2019s funeral."

Chang talks about learning the rules of poetry (and traditional forms) and later searching for more flexible (female? maternal?) forms like the zuihitsu that might contain shopping lists and hyperlinks and also help us speak about race, history and violence. Chang and Zucker also discuss teaching, literary influences and the effect on their mothering of having been intermittently separated from their own mothers at a young age."

They speak about Victoria\u2019s recent book Barbie Chang and about Victoria\u2019s forthcoming book, Obit, and so much more. "

Croft describes translating Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s novel <em>Flights </em>(Riverhead, 2018) for which Croft and Tokarczuk won the Man Booker International Prize, her relationship with Tokarczuk, and the pleasures and challenges of her current translation project: translating Tokarcuzk\u2019s thousand-page historical novel, <em>The Books of Jacob</em>, about 18th century figure Jacob Frank. Croft also speaks about the connection between translation and creative writing and her newly-released illustrated novel-memoir, <em>Homesick</em> (Unnamed Press, 2019) which she wrote in Spanish and then again in English. Croft touches on existential questions about being oneself in a place where one has no history and how one\u2019s life is a mysterious interplay of destiny, accident, choice and perseverance.</p><p class=\"\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><strong>Books by Jennifer Croft</strong></p><p class=\"\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781944700942\">Homesick</a> (Unnamed Press, 2019)</p><p class=\"\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><strong>Books translated by Jennifer Croft</strong></p><p class=\"\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EnbcSG\">Flights by Olga Tokarczuk</a> (Riverhead Books, 2018)</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EmRLtf\">August by Romina Paula </a>(The Feminist Press at CUNY, 2017)</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9788393381869\">Lovely, Human, True, Heartfelt: The Letters of Alina Szapocznikow and Ryszard Stanislawski</a> (Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw, 2012)</p><p class=\"\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><strong>Other Books, Translators and Writers Mentioned in the Episode</strong></p><p class=\"\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=author%3AAji%2C%20Aron\">Aron Aji</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=author%3AWeissbort%2C%20Daniel\">Daniel Weissbort</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=author%3ALloyd-Jones%2C%20Antonia\">Antonia Lloyd Jones</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=author%3AKrall%2C%20Hanna\">Hanna Krall</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Cavanagh\">Claire Cavanagh</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2E0siEG\">Wis\u0142awa Szymborska</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=author%3ABaranczak%2C%20Stanislaw\">Stanislaw Baranczak</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=Maxine+Swann\">Maxine Swann</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2En4WKS\">Wiltold Gombrowicz</a></p><p class=\"\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><strong>Other Relevant Links</strong></p><p class=\"\"><br></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_Award\">The NIKE award</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.unnamedpress.com/\">Unnamed Press</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://bdralyuk.wordpress.com/\">Boris Dralyuk</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/fellowships-institutes/center-for-scholars-and-writers\">The New York Public Library\u2019s Cullman Center</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/14/europe/pawel-adamowicz-gdansk-mayor-stabbed-poland-intl/index.html\">\u201cGdansk mayor Pawel Adamowicz dies after being stabbed in heart on stage\u201d</a> by Helen Regan and Stephanie Wells, for CNN</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://lithub.com/when-an-author-you-translate-gets-death-threats/\">\u201cWhen An Author You Translate Gets Death Threats\u201d</a> by Jennifer Croft, for Lithub</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.arts.gov/grants-individuals/translation-projects\">NEA Translation grants</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.buenosairesreview.org/\">Buenos Aires Review</a></p><p class=\"\">Music for this episode provided by <a href=\"http://payadora.com/\">Payadora</a></p><p class=\"\"><br><br></p><p class=\"\"><strong>Liner notes</strong></p><p class=\"\"><br></p><p class=\"\">14:25 \u201cLa Humilde\u201d Argentine folk song arranged and performed by <a href=\"http://payadora.com/\">Payadora</a>.</p><p class=\"\">16:40 Jennifer Croft reads \u201cBirthday\u201d by <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=author%3ASzymborska%2C%20Wislawa\">Wis\u0142awa Szymborska</a> translated by <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=author%3ASzymborska%2C%20Wislawa\">Wis\u0142awa Szymborska</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Bara%C5%84czak\">Stanislaw Baranczak</a></p><p class=\"\">25:51 \u201cNostalgias Tucumanas\u201d by Atahualpa Yupanqui arranged by Drew Jurecka and performed by <a href=\"http://payadora.com/\">Payadora</a>.</p><p class=\"\">26:30 Jennifer Croft reads from <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525534198\">Flights by Olga Tokarczuk</a> (Riverhead Books, 2018)</p><p class=\"\">27:33 \u201cVolando\u201d composed by Rebekah Wolkstein and performed by <a href=\"http://payadora.com/\">Payadora</a>.</p><p class=\"\">57:58 Jennifer Croft reads her novel/memoir <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781944700942\"><em>Homesick</em></a> in Spanish and English.</p><p class=\"\">1:03:40 \u201cAdios Muchachos\u201d by Julio C\u00e9sar Sanders arranged by Rebekah Wolkstein, performed by <a href=\"http://payadora.com/\">Payadora</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><br>All audio of Jennifer Croft was recorded by Rachel Zucker in New York City on February 13, 2018 at the Cullman Center.

                "summary": "In this episode Jennifer Croft speaks to Commonplace host Rachel Zucker about her childhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, falling in love with Russian language and Slavic grammar, the accidental way she ended up becoming a translator of Polish (rather than Russian), and how her study of Polish led her to Argentina, the place she feels most herself. Croft describes translating Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s novel Flights (Riverhead, 2018) for which Croft and Tokarczuk won the Man Booker International Prize, her relationship with Tokarczuk, and the pleasures and challenges of her current translation project: translating Tokarcuzk\u2019s thousand-page historical novel, The Books of Jacob, about 18th century figure Jacob Frank. Croft also speaks about the connection between translation and creative writing and her newly-released illustrated novel-memoir, Homesick (Unnamed Press, 2019) which she wrote in Spanish and then again in English. Croft touches on existential questions about being oneself in a place where one has no history and how one\u2019s life is a mysterious interplay of destiny, accident, choice and perseverance."

Alcal\u00e1 speaks about growing up in Paterson, N.J., having been a child interpreter and mediator for her Spanish-speaking parents, language shame, studying at Brown and meeting Vicu\u00f1a for the first time, studying transcription and ethnopoetics with Dennis Tedlock at SUNY Buffalo, grappling with how to record ephemerality, inaudibility, temporality, volume, tone and the feeling of listening (and mishearing) when translating, transcribing, and editing Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s multi-lingual performances for the book Spit Temple. Alcal\u00e1 describes her long friendship with Vicu\u00f1a, accepting the invitation to edit and translate Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s New and Selected, retranslating earlier translations, how the work of translating others affects her own writing, poetry as a space to say what is impossible to say in any language, literary and linguistic heritage, her interest in the NY School poets (especially Frank O\u2019Hara and Bernadette Mayer), raising a bilingual child, and her poem \u201cHeritage Speaker\u201d from MyOTHER TONGUE."

In part one, Meitner details her circuitous route to becoming a poet, her early influences (especially the work of Mark Doty), and her conversational diction and increasingly straight-forward poetics. She explains that much of her work arises from a commitment to writing accurately and respectfully about the small town in which she lives, and the challenges of writing as an engaged member of her community while being an othered outsider, a poet, a Jew, and the white mother of a black son. Meitner and Zucker discuss documentary poetry, the ethical considerations of writing about real people, alternatives to the pastoral, and \"gritpo,\" a term neither of them really understand. In part two, Meitner and Zucker speak by phone so that Meitner can describe her experience of reporting in verse while in Cleveland during the Republican National Convention.
