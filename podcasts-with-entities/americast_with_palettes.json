    "description": "The authoritative weekly US news and politics podcast from BBC News, Americast investigates the social and cultural issues that define America today.\n\nIs Joe Biden too old to win another go in the White House? What does Donald Trump\u2019s latest criminal charge mean for the Republican campaign? And why have issues such as LGBT rights, global warming and the war effort in Ukraine become so divisive across the US political spectrum? From foreign policy to pop culture, Americast keeps you up to date and in the know about the stories that matter with on-the-ground insights from right across the US.\n\nAmericast is hosted by trusted journalists including the BBC\u2019s North America editor Sarah Smith, North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher, presenter Justin Webb, and disinformation and social media correspondent, Marianna Spring. Joined by special guests each week such as former chief medical adviser to the president, Dr Anthony Fauci, former FBI director James Comey, CNN anchor and author Jake Tapper, Succession actress J Smith-Cameron, and Suruthi Bala and Hannah Maguire from podcast RedHanded, they look at America through an international lens, trying to make sense of the increasingly polarised political debate.\n\nEach week on Americast, Marianna Spring also brings listeners the latest update on BBC Undercover Voters, the award-winning investigation into the content that is recommended to US voters on social media. Marianna has created undercover voters \u2013 multiple social media accounts belonging to different characters who sit across the US political divide. By tracking the content that is pushed at each of them, this investigation will cover a turbulent time for US politics with speculation over a Trump bid for the presidency and Biden facing domestic and international challenges.\n\nGET IN TOUCH:\n\u2022 Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n\u2022 Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n\u2022 Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n\u2022 Or use #Americast\n\nFind out more about our award-winning \"undercover voters\" here: bbc.in/3lFddSF.",

                "summary": "As a growing number of flying objects are shot down in US airspace, the Biden administration is still trying to explain just what\u2019s going on...and even fielding the odd question about aliens. Why are Americans so obsessed with extra-terrestrials?\n\nMeanwhile, on ground level, many are asking why national media took so long to start covering a major train derailment in Ohio that released hazardous chemicals into the air of a nearby village. \n\nIn Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis has been talking up his move to ban an advanced high school African-American studies course, possibly laying the framework for his presidential bid. Americast talks to Harvard professor, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, who helped devise the course.\n\nAnd in South Carolina, Anthony has been at the launch of Nikki Haley\u2019s presidential campaign. But does she really stand a chance of winning? \n\nFind out more about our \"undercover voters\" here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63530374.\n\nEmail Americast@bbc.co.uk with your questions and comments and send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp, to +44 3301239480.\n\nThis episode was made by Phil Marzouk and Cat Farnsworth.

Not Jon Sopel, another beauty (he\u2019s still in London.) But Donald Trump, is preparing to hold the first post-presidential rally. We hear from POLITICO\u2019s White House insider Anita Kumar about how Trump plans to stay relevant and why he\u2019s always the elephant in the room for Joe Biden."

What does Donald Trump\u2019s latest criminal charge mean for the Republican campaign? And why have issues such as LGBT rights, global warming and the war effort in Ukraine become so divisive across the US political spectrum? From foreign policy to pop culture, Americast keeps you up to date and in the know about the stories that matter with on-the-ground insights from right across the US.\n\nAmericast is hosted by trusted journalists including the BBC\u2019s North America editor Sarah Smith, North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher, presenter Justin Webb, and disinformation and social media correspondent, Marianna Spring. Joined by special guests each week such as former chief medical adviser to the president, Dr Anthony Fauci, former FBI director James Comey, CNN anchor and author Jake Tapper, Succession actress J Smith-Cameron, and Suruthi Bala and Hannah Maguire from podcast RedHanded, they look at America through an international lens, trying to make sense of the increasingly polarised political debate.\n\nEach week on Americast, Marianna Spring also brings listeners the latest update on BBC Undercover Voters, the award-winning investigation into the content that is recommended to US voters on social media. Marianna has created undercover voters \u2013 multiple social media accounts belonging to different characters who sit across the US political divide. By tracking the content that is pushed at each of them, this investigation will cover a turbulent time for US politics with speculation over a Trump bid for the presidency and Biden facing domestic and international challenges.\n\nGET IN TOUCH:\n\u2022 Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n\u2022 Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n\u2022 Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n\u2022 Or use #Americast\n\nFind out more about our award-winning \"undercover voters\" here: bbc.in/3lFddSF."
