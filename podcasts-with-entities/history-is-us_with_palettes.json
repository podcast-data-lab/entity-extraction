    "description": "There will always be something distinct about our present day, yet history haunts. American democracy is at a crossroads, and we have to decide who we really are as a nation. This moment begs us all to look to our past to help understand our present, and to imagine a better future. In the aftermath of the carnage of the Civil War, the nation struggled to give shape to a country drenched in blood. In many ways, we are still fighting old battles and still trapped in assumptions that blocked the way to imagining a new America. Written and narrated by award-winning author and Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, Dr. Eddie S. Glaude, \u201cHistory is US\u201d is a 6-part audio documentary produced and developed by C13Originals that asks questions about who we are as a nation, and what race might reveal about our current crisis. Through the voices of distinguished historians and scholars, this limited series gives listeners the background and education to understand how we got here and how we can all use history to clarify the choices before us. \u201cHistory is US\u201d is a presentation of Shining City Audio, a C13Originals and Jon Meacham Studio.",
