A massive earthquake in 1755 devastated Lisbon, and this disaster helped inspire a new science of seismology which intensified after San Francisco in 1906 and advanced even further with the need to monitor nuclear tests around the world from 1945 onwards.  While we now know so much more about what lies beneath the surface of the Earth, and how rocks move and crack, it remains impossible to predict when earthquakes will happen. Thanks to seismology, though, we have a clearer idea of where earthquakes will happen and how to make some of them less hazardous to lives and homes.\n\nWith\n\nRebecca Bell\nSenior lecturer in Geology and Geophysics at Imperial College London\n\nZoe Mildon\nLecturer in Earth Sciences and Future Leaders Fellow at the University of Plymouth\n\nAnd \n\nJames Hammond\nReader in Geophysics at Birkbeck, University of London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",

According to legend, it was written by Chanakya, a political advisor to the ruler Chandragupta Maurya (reigned 321 \u2013 297 BC) who founded the Mauryan Empire, the first great Empire in the Indian subcontinent. As the Arthashastra asserts that a ruler should pursue his goals ruthlessly by whatever means is required, it has been compared with the 16th-century work The Prince by Machiavelli.

Kropotkin (1842 - 1921) was born into privilege, very much in the highest circle of Russian society as a pageboy for the Tsar, before he became a republican in childhood and dropped the title 'Prince'.  While working in Siberia, he started reading about anarchism and that radicalised him further, as did his observations of Siberian villagers supporting each other without (or despite) a role for the State.  He made a name for himself as a geographer but soon his politics landed him in jail in St Petersburg, from which he escaped to exile in England where he was f\u00eated, with growing fame leading to lecture tours in the USA.  His time in Siberia also inspired his ideas on the importance of mutual aid in evolution, a counter to the dominant idea from Darwin and Huxley that life was a gladiatorial combat in which only the fittest survived.  Kropotkin became such a towering figure in public life that, returning to Russia, he was able to challenge Lenin without reprisal, and Lenin in turn permitted his enormous public funeral there, attended by 20,000 mourners.\n\nWith \n\nRuth Kinna\nProfessor of Political Theory at Loughborough University\n\nLee Dugatkin\nProfessor of Biology at the University of Louisville\n\nAnd\n\nSimon Dixon\nThe Sir Bernard Pares Professor of Russian History at University College London",

                "summary": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss an early masterpiece of French epic poetry, from the 12th Century.  It is a reimagining of Charlemagne\u2019s wars in Spain in the 8th Century in which Roland, his most valiant knight, chooses death before dishonour, guarding the army\u2019s rear from a pagan ambush as it heads back through the Roncesvalles Pass in the Pyrenees.  If he wanted to, Roland could blow on his oliphant, his elephant tusk horn, to summon help by calling back Charlemagne's army, but according to his values that would bring shame both on him and on France, and he would rather keep killing pagans until he is the last man standing and the last to die.\n\nThe image above is taken from an illustration of Charlemagne finding Roland after the Battle of Roncevaux/Roncesvalles, from 'Les Grandes Chroniques de France', c.1460 by Jean Fouquet, Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, Ms Fr 6465 f.113 \n\nWith \n\nLaura Ashe\nProfessor of English Literature and Fellow in English at Worcester College, University of Oxford\n\nMiranda Griffin\nAssistant Professor of Medieval French at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Murray Edwards College\n\nAnd\n\nLuke Sunderland\nProfessor in the School of Modern Languages and Cultures at Durham University\n\nStudio producer: John Goudie"

Before the war, scientists in Germany  had discovered the potential of nuclear fission and scientists in Britain soon argued that this could be used to make an atom bomb, against which there could be no defence other than to own one. The fear among the Allies was that, with its head start, Germany might develop the bomb first and, unmatched, use it on its enemies.  The USA took up the challenge in a huge engineering project led by General Groves and Robert Oppenheimer and, once the first bomb had been exploded at Los Alamos in July 1945, it appeared inevitable that the next ones would be used against Japan with devastating results.\n\nThe image above is of Robert Oppenheimer and General Groves examining the remains of one the bases of the steel test tower, at the atomic bomb Trinity Test site, in September 1945.\n\nWith\n\nBruce Cameron Reed\nThe Charles A.

For tens of millions of years, the ancestors of alligators and Nile crocodiles included some as large as a bus, some running on two legs like a T Rex and some that lived like whales. They survived and rebounded from a series of extinction events but, while the range of habitats of the dinosaur descendants such as birds covers much of the globe, those of the crocodiles have contracted, even if the animals themselves continue to evolve today as quickly as they ever have.\n\nWith\n\nAnjali Goswami\nResearch Leader in Life Sciences and Dean of Postgraduate Education at the Natural History Museum\n\nPhilip Mannion\nLecturer in the Department of Earth Sciences at University College London \n\nAnd\n\nSteve Brusatte\nProfessor of Palaeontology and Evolution at the University of Edinburgh\n\nProducer Simon Tillotson"

It was as revolutionary, in his view, as when the Polish astronomer Copernicus realised that Earth revolves around the Sun rather than the Sun around Earth.

Mariners could already calculate how far they were north or south, the Latitude, using the Pole Star, but voyaging across the Atlantic to the Caribbean was much less predictable as navigators could not be sure how far east or west they were, a particular problem when heading for islands.  It took fifty years of individual genius and collaboration in Britain and across Europe, among astronomers, clock makers, mathematicians and sailors, for the problem to be resolved.\n\nWith\n\nRebekah Higgitt\nPrincipal Curator of Science at National Museums Scotland\n\nJim Bennett\nKeeper Emeritus at the Science Museum\n\nAnd \n\nSimon Schaffer\nProfessor of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

Ricardo (1772 -1823) reputedly made his fortune at the Battle of Waterloo, and he made his lasting impact with his ideas on free trade.  At a time when nations preferred to be self-sufficient, to produce all their own food and manufacture their own goods, and to find markets for export rather than import, Ricardo argued for free trade even with rivals for the benefit of all.  He contended that existing economic policy unduly favoured landlords above all others and needed to change, and that nations would be less likely to go to war with their trading partners if they were more reliant on each other.  For the last two hundred years, Ricardo\u2019s Theory of Comparative Advantage in support of free trade has been developed and reinterpreted by generations of economists across the political spectrum.\n\nWith\n\nMatthew Watson\nProfessor of Political Economy at the University of Warwick\n\nHelen Paul\nLecturer in Economics and Economic History at the University of Southampton\n\nAnd\n\nRichard Whatmore\nProfessor of Modern History at the University of St Andrews and Co-Director of the St Andrews Institute of Intellectual History\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",

In ancient China, for example, there was a story that a dragon was eating the sun and it had to be scared away by banging pots and pans if the sun were to return. Total lunar eclipses are more frequent and last longer, with a blood moon coloured red like a sunrise or sunset.  Both events have created the chance for scientists to learn something remarkable, from the speed of light, to the width of the Atlantic, to the roundness of Earth, to discovering helium and proving Einstein\u2019s Theory of General Relativity.\n\nWith \n\nCarolin Crawford\nPublic Astronomer based at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge and a fellow of Emmanuel College\n\n\nFrank Close\nEmeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford\n\nAnd\n\nLucie Green\nProfessor of Physics and a Royal Society University Research Fellow at Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London\n\n\nProducers: Simon Tillotson and Julia Johnson"

The British slave ship Zong, having sailed across the Atlantic towards Jamaica, threw 132 enslaved Africans from its human cargo into the sea to drown. Even for a slave ship, the Zong was overcrowded; those murdered were worth more to the ship dead than alive. The crew said there was not enough drinking water to go round and they had no choice, which meant they could claim for the deaths on insurance.

When three witches prophesy that Macbeth will be king one day, he is not prepared to wait and almost the next day he murders King Duncan as he sleeps, a guest at Macbeth\u2019s castle.  From there we explore their brutal world where few boundaries are distinct \u2013 between safe and unsafe, friend and foe, real and unreal, man and beast \u2013 until Macbeth too is slaughtered.\n\nThe image above shows Nicol Williamson as Macbeth in a 1983 BBC TV adaptation.\n\nWith:\n\nEmma Smith\nProfessor of Shakespeare Studies at Hertford College, University of Oxford\n\nKiernan Ryan\nEmeritus Professor of English Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nAnd \n\nDavid Schalkwyk,\nProfessor of Shakespeare Studies and Director of Global Shakespeare at Queen Mary, University of London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

One way of defining the boundary of the solar system is where the pressure from the solar wind is balanced by that from the region between the stars, the interstellar medium.  Its existence was suggested from the C19th and Eugene Parker developed the theory of it in the 1950s and it has been examined and tested by a series of probes in C20th up to today, with more planned.\n\nWith \n\nAndrew Coates\nProfessor of Physics and Deputy Director in charge of the Solar System at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London\n\nHelen Mason OBE\nReader in Solar Physics at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge, Fellow at St Edmund's College\n\nAnd\n\nTim Horbury\nProfessor of Physics at Imperial College London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

                "summary": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life and poetry of WH Auden (1907-1973) up to his departure from Europe for the USA in 1939.  As well as his personal life, he addressed suffering and confusion, and the moral issues that affected the wider public in the 1930s and tried to unpick what was going wrong in society and to understand those times. He witnessed the rise of totalitarianism in the austerity of that decade, travelling through Germany to Berlin, seeing Spain in the Civil War and China during its wars with Japan, often collaborating with Christopher Isherwood. In his lifetime his work attracted high praise and intense criticism, and has found new audiences in the fifty years since his death, sometimes taking literally what he meant ironically. \n\nWith \n\nMark Ford\nPoet and Professor of English at University College London\n\nJanet Montefiore\nProfessor Emerita of 20th Century English Literature at the University of Kent\n\nAnd \n\nJeremy Noel-Tod\nSenior Lecturer in Literature and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

                "summary": "In a programme first broadcast in November 2018, Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Austrian princess Maria Antonia, child bride of the future French King Louis XVI.  Their marriage was an attempt to bring about a major change in the balance of power in Europe and to undermine the influence of Prussia and Great Britain, but she had no say in the matter and was the pawn of her mother, the Empress Maria Theresa. She fulfilled her allotted role of supplying an heir, but was sent to the guillotine in 1793 in the French Revolution, a few months after her husband, following years of attacks on her as a woman who, it was said, betrayed the King and as a foreigner who betrayed France to enemy powers. When not doing these wrongs, she was said to be personally bankrupting France. Her death shocked royal families throughout Europe, and she became a powerful symbol of the consequences of the Revolution. \n\nWith \n\nCatriona Seth\nMarshal Foch Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford\n\nKatherine Astbury\nProfessor of French Studies at the University of Warwick\n\nand\n\nDavid McCallam\nReader in French Eighteenth-Century Studies at the University of Sheffield\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

He wrote De La D\u00e9mocratie en Am\u00e9rique in two parts, published in 1835 and 1840, when France was ruled by the July Monarchy of Louis-Philippe. Tocqueville was interested in how aspects of American democracy, in the age of President Andrew Jackson, could be applied to Europe as it moved away from rule by monarchs and aristocrats. His work has been revisited by politicians ever since, particularly in America, with its analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of direct democracy and its warnings of mediocrity and the tyranny of the majority.\n\nWith\n\nRobert Gildea\nProfessor of Modern History at the University of Oxford\n\nSusan-Mary Grant\nProfessor of American History at Newcastle University\n\nand \n\nJeremy Jennings\nProfessor of Political Theory and Head of the School of Politics & Economics at King's College London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

                "summary": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Shakespeare's best known, most quoted and longest play, written c1599 - 1602 and rewritten throughout his lifetime. It is the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, encouraged by his father's ghost to take revenge on his uncle who murdered him, and is set at the court of Elsinore. In soliloquies, the Prince reveals his inner self to the audience while concealing his thoughts from all at the Danish court, who presume him insane. Shakespeare gives him lines such as 'to be or not to be,' 'alas, poor Yorick,' and 'frailty thy name is woman', which are known even to those who have never seen or read the play. And Hamlet has become the defining role for actors, men and women, who want to show their mastery of Shakespeare's work. \n\nThe image above is from the 1964 film adaptation, directed by Grigori Kozintsev, with Innokenty Smoktunovsky as Hamlet.\n\nWith\n\nSir Jonathan Bate\nProvost of Worcester College, University of Oxford\n\nCarol Rutter\nProfessor of Shakespeare and Performance Studies at the University of Warwick\n\nAnd\n\nSonia Massai\nProfessor of Shakespeare Studies at King's College London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

And what has been learned in the last twenty years, through archaeology? \n\nWith \n\nKatherine Forsyth\nReader in the Department of Celtic and Gaelic at the University of Glasgow\n\nAlex Woolf\nSenior Lecturer in Dark Age Studies at the University of St Andrews\n\nand \n\nGordon Noble\nReader in Archaeology at the University of Aberdeen\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

                "summary": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss how, in the Enlightenment, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) sought to define the difference between right and wrong by applying reason, looking at the intention behind actions rather than at consequences. He was inspired to find moral laws by natural philosophers such as Newton and Leibniz, who had used reason rather than emotion to analyse the world around them and had identified laws of nature. Kant argued that when someone was doing the right thing, that person was doing what was the universal law for everyone, a formulation that has been influential on moral philosophy ever since and is known as the Categorical Imperative. Arguably even more influential was one of his reformulations, echoed in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in which he asserted that humanity has a value of an entirely different kind from that placed on commodities. Kant argued that simply existing as a human being was valuable in itself, so that every human owed moral responsibilities to other humans and was owed responsibilities in turn.\n\nWith \n\nAlison Hills\nProfessor of Philosophy at St John's College, Oxford\n\nDavid Oderberg\nProfessor of Philosophy at the University of Reading\n\nand\n\nJohn Callanan\nSenior Lecturer in Philosophy at King's College, London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

This was a struggle between the Angevin and Capetian dynasties, one that followed Capetian successes over the Angevins in France. The forces of the new boy-king, Henry III, attacked those of Louis of France, the claimant backed by rebel Barons. Henry's regent, William Marshal, was almost seventy when he led the charge on Lincoln that day, and his victory confirmed his reputation as England's greatest knight. Louis sent to France for reinforcements but in August these, too, were defeated at sea, at the Battle of Sandwich. As part of the peace deal, Henry reissued Magna Carta, which King John had granted in 1215 but soon withdrawn, and Louis went home, leaving England's Anglo-French rulers more Anglo and less French than he had planned. \n\nThe image above is by Matthew Paris (c1200-1259) from his Chronica Majora (MS 16, f. 55v) and appears with the kind permission of the Master and Fellows of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge\n\nWith\n\nLouise Wilkinson\nProfessor of Medieval History at Canterbury Christ Church University\n\nStephen Church\nProfessor of Medieval History at the University of East Anglia\n\nand\n\nThomas Asbridge\nReader in Medieval History at Queen Mary, University of London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

Over c1000 years, global temperatures rose more than 5 C on average and stayed that way for c100,000 years more, with the surface of seas in the Arctic being as warm as those in the subtropics.

In 1610, Galileo used an early telescope to observe Saturn, one of the brightest points in the night sky, but could not make sense of what he saw: perhaps two large moons on either side. When he looked a few years later, those supposed moons had disappeared. It was another forty years before Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens solved the mystery, realizing the moons were really a system of rings. Successive astronomers added more detail, with the greatest leaps forward in the last forty years. The Pioneer 11 spacecraft and two Voyager missions have flown by, sending back the first close-up images, and Cassini is still there, in orbit, confirming Saturn, with its rings and many moons, as one of the most intriguing and beautiful planets in our Solar System. \n\nWith\n\nCarolin Crawford\nPublic Astronomer at the Institute of Astronomy and Fellow of Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge\n\nMichele Dougherty\nProfessor of Space Physics at Imperial College London\n\nAnd\n\nAndrew Coates\nDeputy Director in charge of the Solar System at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at UCL."

Advanced by the Qin statesman Shang Yang and later blended together by Han Fei, the three main aspects of Legalism were the firm implementation of laws, use of techniques such as responsibility and inscrutability, and taking advantage of the ruler's position. The Han dynasty that replaced the Qin discredited this philosophy for its apparent authoritarianism, but its influence continued, re-emerging throughout Chinese history.\n\nWith\n\nFrances Wood\nFormer Curator of the Chinese Collections at the British Library\n\nHilde de Weerdt\nProfessor of Chinese History at Leiden University\n\nAnd\n\nRoel Sterckx\nJoseph Needham Professor of Chinese History at the University of Cambridge.\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

Published in 1949, it was an immediate success with the thousands of women who bought it. Many male critics felt men came out of it rather badly. Beauvoir was born in 1908 to a high bourgeois family and it was perhaps her good fortune that her father lost his money when she was a girl. With no dowry, she pursued her education in Paris to get work and in a key exam to allow her to teach philosophy, came second only to Jean Paul Sartre. He was retaking. They became lovers and, for the rest of their lives together, intellectual sparring partners. Sartre concentrated on existentialist philosophy; Beauvoir explored that, and existentialist ethics, plus the novel and, increasingly in the decades up to her death in 1986, the situation of women in the world. \n\nWith\nChristina Howells\nProfessor of French and Fellow of Wadham College at the University of Oxford\n\nMargaret Atack\nProfessor of French at the University of Leeds\n\nAnd \n\nUrsula Tidd\nProfessor of Modern French Literature and Thought at the University of Manchester\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

She leaves the school for Thornfield Hall, to become governess to the French ward of Mr Rochester. She and Rochester fall in love but, at their wedding, it is revealed he is married already and his wife, insane, is kept in Thornfield's attic. When Jane Eyre was published in 1847, it was a great success and brought fame to Charlotte Bronte. Combined with Gothic mystery and horror, the book explores many themes, including the treatment of children, relations between men and women, religious faith and hypocrisy, individuality, morality, equality and the nature of true love. \n\nWith\n\nDinah Birch\nProfessor of English Literature and Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research at the University of Liverpool\n\nKaren O'Brien\nVice Principal and Professor of English Literature at King's College London\n\nAnd\n\nSara Lyons\nLecturer in Victorian Literature at the University of Kent\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

In 1903 Marie and Pierre Curie shared a Nobel Prize in Physics with Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity, a term which Marie coined. Marie went on to win a Nobel in Chemistry eight years later; remarkably, her daughter Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie would later share a Nobel with her husband Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie for their discovery that it was possible to create radioactive materials in the laboratory. The work of the Curies added immensely to our knowledge of fundamental physics and paved the way for modern treatments for cancer and other illnesses.\n\nWith:\n\nPatricia Fara\nSenior Tutor of Clare College, University of Cambridge\n\nRobert Fox\nEmeritus Professor of the History of Science at the University of Oxford\n\nSteven T Bramwell\nProfessor of Physics and former Professor of Chemistry at University College London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

The tradition lingered until surprisingly recently, with castrated singers remaining a feature of Vatican choirs until the nineteenth century, while the last Chinese eunuch of the imperial court died in 1996.\n\nWith:\n\nKaren Radner\nProfessor of Ancient Near Eastern History at University College London\n\nShaun Tougher\nReader in Ancient History at Cardiff University\n\nMichael Hoeckelmann\nBritish Academy Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of History at King's College London\n\nProducer: Thomas Morris."

When she came to the throne, Egypt was still recovering from a period of turbulence known as the Second Intermediate Period a few generations earlier. Hatshepsut reasserted Egyptian power by building up international trade and commissioned buildings considered masterpieces of Egyptian architecture.

First published in 1925, it charts a single day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a prosperous member of London society, as she prepares to throw a party. Writing in her diary during the writing of the book, Woolf explained what she had set out to do: 'I want to give life and death, sanity and insanity. I want to criticize the social system, and to show it at work at its most intense.' Celebrated for its innovative narrative technique and distillation of many of the preoccupations of 1920s Britain, Mrs Dalloway is now seen as a landmark of twentieth-century fiction, and one of the finest products of literary modernism.\n\nWith:\n\nProfessor Dame Hermione Lee\nPresident of Wolfson College, Oxford\n\nJane Goldman\nReader in English Literature at the University of Glasgow\n\nKathryn Simpson\nSenior Lecturer in English Literature at Cardiff Metropolitan University.",
