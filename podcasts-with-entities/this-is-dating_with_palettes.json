Follow four modern daters as they trade the swiping, the small talk, and the fumbled first kiss for a curated virtual date with a team of fairy godmothers behind the scenes. You might have eavesdropped on a first date before, but never like this. From the producers of Where Should We Begin, This is Dating, a series of recorded first dates. If you would like to get new episodes a week or so in advance in addition to ad-free listening subscribe to This Is Dating on Apple Podcasts. Visit the This Is Dating show page on Apple Podcasts for more info.</p>\n\n<p>We will be back in the fall with a whole new series of recorded first dates.  Thanks for being a part of this first season we can\u2019t wait for you to hear who we will set up next.</p>\n    ",
