Hopefully your church is the picture of health, where everyone\u2019s growing in love of God and love of neighbor. Or maybe your church has a discipleship disease. If so, then JT English can help with his new book,\u00a0Deep Discipleship: How the Church Can Make Whole Disciples of Jesus, published by B&H. English\u00a0serves as the lead pastor of Storyline Fellowship in Arvada, Colorado. Previously, JT served as a pastor at The Village Church in Flower Mound, Texas, where he founded and directed The Village Church Institute, which is committed to theological education in the local church JT sees churches worried about being irrelevant, worried they\u2019re asking too much of busy people. Many Christians seem to think the church has gotten too deep. But JT English couldn\u2019t disagree more! As you might guess from his book title, he says most churches aren\u2019t nearly deep enough. He writes: People are leaving not because we have given them too\u00a0much but because we have given them far too little. They are\u00a0leaving the church because we have not given them any reason\u00a0to stay. We are treating the symptoms of the wrong disease.\u00a0Deep discipleship is about giving people more Bible, not less;\u00a0more theology, not less; more spiritual disciplines, not less;\u00a0more gospel, not less; more Christ,\u00a0not less. The good news is that deep discipleship does not require massive resources, a large congregation, or an enormous ministry staff.\u00a0It starts with not apologizing when we ask Christians to make commitments. JT joins me now on\u00a0Gospelbound\u00a0to discuss Sunday school and small groups, travel baseball, active learning, and commissioning culture.</p>\n",

But by believing that we are our own, we tend to struggle with\u00a0new problems:\u00a0the loss of meaning, identity, and purpose.</p><p>Noble\u00a0says\u00a0this in his new book,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-Your-Own/dp/0830847820/?tag=thegospcoal-20\"><i>You Are Not Your Own: Belonging to God in an Inhuman World</i></a>, published by InterVarsity:</p><p>Everyone is on their own private journey of self-discovery and self-expression so that at times, modern life feels like billions of people in the same room shouting their name so that everyone else knows they exist and who they are\u2014which is a fairly accurate description of social media.</p><p>Noble\u2019s book feels like a douse of cold water that wakes us from our delusion. His book builds off the first question and answer of the Heidelberg Catechism. And he helps us find our way back to this\u00a0well-worn path of\u00a0divine\u00a0wisdom.

It\u2019s not\u00a0<i>against</i>\u00a0evidence but careful consideration\u00a0<i>of</i>\u00a0evidence. It\u2019s trust in the story that makes sense of the world. It\u2019s curiosity.

Let habit take you by the hand and lead you to God.\u201d</p><p>Michel says that faith pushes back against the technological advances that convey the illusion that exertion is our enemy. In this book designed to help introduce the Bible to anyone curious about faith, Michel guides readers on a 40-day journey through the wilderness of doubts to the promised land of hope in the promises of God.

And he\u2019s the author of the new book\u00a0Making Faith Magnetic: Five Hidden Themes Our Culture Can\u2019t Stop Talking About and How to Connect Them to Christ, published by The Good Book Company.\u00a0In this book, he tries to help non-Christians find their way to God through the darkness of a skeptical age. He writes:\nIn the 21st-century West, in\u00a0our\u00a0version of this history, God is the one who has done the hiding and we are the seekers. And God must have found a great place to hide because we\u2019ve looked for him everywhere but he\u2019s nowhere to be seen.\nStrange features five magnetic points that he thinks can help non-Christians connect to Jesus. His book explores totality, norm, deliverance, destiny, and higher power. In this episode, we\u2019ll talk about J. H. Bavinck, the totality, Goth culture, disenchantment, and more.",

In this book you\u2019ll get biblical and theological guidance that transcends time, continent, and culture. You\u2019ll see much appreciation for the strengths of African churches. And you\u2019ll also get Conrad\u2019s clear-eyed analysis of their weaknesses. For example, here are his comments on African preaching:\n\"The popular sermons today are motivational speeches. They are based on worldly principles that promise people earthly benefits if they say the right words or do the right things. These draw the crowds, but the people are not interested in growth in holiness. They want entertainment and earthly treasures. There is also a very high turnover of congregants. Many become disillusioned because the principles they are being taught are not working for them and so they leave quietly. Many more come in and take their place, hoping that the magic formulas will work for them.\"\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019d write something much different about the United States.\nConrad joins me on Gospelbound to discuss witchcraft, tribalism, the relationship between evangelism and mercy ministry, among other topics.\n\u00a0\nToday\u2019s episode of Gospelbound is sponsored by the Christian Standard Bible, a translation that presents the truth of God\u2019s Word with accuracy and clarity for today\u2019s readers, equipping them for lifelong discipleship.

And maybe even how we can introduce them to Jesus.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nToday's episode of Gospelbound is sponsored by the Christian Standard Bible, a translation that presents the truth of God\u2019s Word with accuracy and clarity for today\u2019s readers, equipping them for lifelong discipleship.

He warns us to expect \u201cdangerous adulation and harsh criticism.\u201d He points us to Jesus, because the unpredictable and uncomfortable world of church leadership is not a safe place to look for identity and inner security.\u201d\u00a0\nPaul joins me on Gospelbound to discuss our leadership crisis in the church and how we can fight against it in the power of God\u2019s grace.\n\u00a0\nThis episode of Gospelbound is brought to you by Rooted Reservoir, an online resource by Rooted Ministry.

We\u2019re talking about the century following the Protestant Reformation, a century marked by wars of religion fought between Protestants and Catholics, and civil war in England. It\u2019s the century that gave us these words: \u201cWhat is the chief end of man? Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever\u201d from the<a href=\"http://www.westminsterconfession.org/confessional-standards/the-westminster-shorter-catechism.php\" target=\"_blank\"> Westminster Shorter Catechism</a>. What seems to us as an era defined by religion seemed to many at the time to be marked instead by unbelief.</p><p>Atheism and religious skepticism has a long history in the West, as Ryrie shows in his new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unbelievers-Emotional-History-Alec-Ryrie/dp/0674241827/?tag=thegospcoal-20\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Unbelievers: An Emotional History of Doubt</i></a>, published by Harvard University Press.

            "contentSnippet": "We may not agree on much any longer. But this we seem to share in common: we don\u2019t trust institutions. Just the drop in Americans\u2019 confidence in organized religion should concern us: from 65 percent expressing a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in organized religion 40 years ago down to 38 percent in 2018.\nLess trust in institutions means fewer close friends. We spend less time with others and feel more disconnected. Through online media we\u2019ve never been exposed to so many competing views, and yet somehow we\u2019ve never been so ignorant of what others believe. The old men who used to volunteer with the Lion\u2019s Club now sit home alone at night watching Fox News.\nYuval Levin argues that we thrive inside institutions where we develop relationships of commitment, obligation, and responsibility.

Senkbeil is an executive director of DOXOLOGY: The Lutheran Center for Spiritual Care, and a veteran of nearly 50 years in parish ministry, seminary teaching, and parachurch leadership.\nSenkbeil argues that we\u2019ve focused so much on winning souls that we\u2019ve neglected to keep them. Just look at the attrition rates for people who grew up in the church but drifted away. He advocates for a priority, then, on pastoral care against models of pastoral ministry as activity manager, CEO, or unlicensed therapist.\nNevertheless, he recognizes that many pastors lack spiritual depth and awareness to take up the challenge of pastoral care. We try to give ourselves, but we quickly run low on our own resources of empathy.\nHe writes: \u201cNo matter how compassionate and empathetic a pastor is, there\u2019s just no way he can come up with what it takes to feed the sheep of Christ effectively, much less tend to their spiritual heartaches, bruises, and injuries.\u201d\nSenkbeil joins me on Gospelbound to discuss how he learned these lessons the hard way, why Christian living is more caught than taught, and what he\u2019s seen as the biggest change in pastoral ministry over the last half-century.\n\u00a0\nThis episode of Gospelbound is sponsored by Southeastern Seminary, equipping today\u2019s ministry leaders with the Word of God, a philosophical foundation, and care for the lost through their Masters program in Ethics, Theology, and Culture and the Ph.D. in Public Theology.
