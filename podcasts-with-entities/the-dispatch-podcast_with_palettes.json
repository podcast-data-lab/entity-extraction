                "summary": "Last night was the first presidential debate and it was \u2026 not a great moment for the country, to say the least. As Sarah reminds us, presidential candidates go into debates with a strategy, basing their metric of success on their ability to boost turnout among an already existing base. Did either candidate achieve what they wanted to achieve? Are undecided voters who watched the debate now more or less likely to show up to the polls? If you haven\u2019t been following every twist and turn of the race, Trump appeared strong and forceful during the debate, interrupting the moderator and his doddering opponent in perpetuity. But were Trump\u2019s interruptions strategic? As Jonah argues, \u201cHe didn\u2019t let Biden talk when Biden was talking badly.\u201d Rather than give Biden the opportunity to fumble, the president was just a \u201cblunderbuss of interruptions,\u201d a problem that was compounded by his refusal to condemn white supremacy.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, somewhat succeeded in his do no harm, let Trump be Trump strategy, minor gaffes aside. But it was by no means a show-stopping performance from the Democratic nominee. All things considered, it mostly served as a reminder that maybe mute buttons would be a good idea next time around. After a debate recap, Sarah and the guys discuss the electoral and national security implications of the New York Times\u2019 report on Trump\u2019s tax returns, as well as the DNI Director John Ratcliffe\u2019s letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham regarding the FBI\u2019s handling of Crossfire Hurricane. Stick around for a fun conversation about our podcast hosts\u2019 favorite cult classic films.\n\n\n\nShow Notes:\n\n-30 day free trial at The Dispatch, Dispatch Live Post-Debate Edition, Frank Luntz\u2019s focus group, post-debate Telemundo poll, New York Times\u2019 report on Trump\u2019s tax returns, DNI letter from John Ratcliffe.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "\u201cPeople ask me this all the time, \u2018Why the hell did you stay?\u2019 \u201d explains Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff for the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration and founder of the Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform (REPAIR). \u201cAnd my response is: If you saw what was happening, why the hell wouldn\u2019t you stay if you cared about your country?\u201d On today\u2019s episode, Miles Taylor gives Sarah and Steve an inside scoop as to what it\u2019s like working for a president who constantly gives you orders to break the law and who believes he has \u201cmagical powers\u201d to do whatever he wants. The most frustrating part of his job as DHS chief of staff, he said, was watching high officials who expressed disdain for the president in private but refused to speak up when it mattered most. \u201cThere was another time that we were in [the Oval Office] and he went off on a tirade about the Mexicans,\u201d Taylor explains, \u201cIn the conversations he said, \u2018Look, Mexico is just a total hellhole, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just a total hellhole.\u2019 And he kind of looked around the room for agreement, and he was like, \u2018Right? You know I can\u2019t say shithole countries anymore but it\u2019s a hellhole, right?\u201d Taylor said most people in the room\u2014except for one official who Taylor didn\u2019t name\u2014laughed it off and nodded rather than standing up to the president.\n\nTaylor said he and his colleagues went into that administration recognizing that Donald Trump was a man of pretty poor character, but there was a hope that the office itself would perhaps change the president for the better. \u201cI really think once he had the powers of the presidency, he got drunk on the powers of the presidency and they did not have that sobering effect, they had a very inebriating effect on President Trump and magnified some of his worst impulses.\u201d Tune in to hear Miles explain what it\u2019s like having a Trump tweet change the trajectory of your entire day as a DHS staffer, whether Republicans should vote for Biden this election cycle, and how REPAIR hopes to fix the GOP in the post-Trump era. If anything, tune just in to hear Taylor explain why \u201cevery single day in the Donald Trump administration was a pride swallowing siege.\u201d\n\n\n\nShow Notes:\n\n-The Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
