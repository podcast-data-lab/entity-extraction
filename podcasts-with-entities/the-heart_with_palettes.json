            "contentSnippet": "It was sometime in the early years of their marriage when Gerda Weganer asked her husband, Einar, to dress in women\u2019s clothes and sit for a painting. The intended subject was running late, and suggested to Gerda that Einar be her stand in. \u201cHis legs and feet are as pretty as mine,\u201d she said.\nAll dressed up in a wig, painted with rouge and powders, and buckled into high-heeled shoes, Einar, now Lili, looked into the mirror with a singular wonder: \u201cWas it really possible that I could be so good looking?\u201d\nSo begins the story of Lili Elbe, a transgender painter and painter\u2019s muse, who underwent one of the first series of modern gender confirmation surgeries. Her third surgery, meant to implant a uterus, eventually killed her, but not before she documented her life stories into papers that would later be compiled into the book, Man into Woman.\nLili Elbe\u2019s hope was that her book fall into the hands of people like her. She wanted her words to help generations of trans people know that they weren\u2019t alone. Unfortunately, the book is out of print.
