But what if we all were empowered to use our voices and perspectives to imagine a better world in which we all can thrive while creating and using technology as we choose?\u00a0</p><p>That idea guides Deji Bryce Olukotun\u2019s work both as a critically acclaimed author and as a tech company\u2019s social impact chief. Instead of just envisioning the oligarch-dominated dystopia we fear, he believes speculative fiction can instead paint a picture of healthy, open societies in which all share in technology\u2019s economic bounty. It can also help to free people\u2019s imaginations to envision more competitive, level playing fields. Then we can use those diverse visions to guide policy solutions, from antitrust enforcement to knocking down the laws that stymie innovation.\u00a0</p><p>Olukotun speaks with EFF\u2019s Cindy Cohn and Jason Kelley about rejecting the inevitability of the tech future that profit-driven corporate figureheads describe, and choosing instead to exercise the right to imagine our own future and leverage that vision into action.</p><p>In this episode you\u2019ll learn about:\u00a0\u00a0</p><ul><li>The influence of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency and Silicon Valley\u2019s rapid expansion on Olukotun\u2019s seminal \u201cNigerians in Space.\u201d</li><li>The value in envisioning a \u201cpost-scarcity\u201d world.</li><li>Using speculative fiction to more accurately portray the long, complicated arc of civil liberties battles.</li><li>The importance of stakeholder-based activism in advancing solutions to critical issues from protecting democracy to combating climate change.</li></ul><p>Deji Bryce Olukotun is the author of two novels and his fiction has appeared in five book collections. His novel \u201c<a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/deji-bryce-olukotun/after-the-flare/\">After the Flare</a>\u201d won the 2018 Philip K. Dick special citation and was chosen as one of the best books of 2017 by The Guardian, The Washington Post, Syfy.com, Tor.com, Kirkus Reviews, among others. A former<a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/deji-bryce-olukotun/\"> Future Tense Fellow</a> at New America, Olukotun is<a href=\"https://sustainability.sonos.com/Giving-Back/default.aspx\"> Head of Social Impact at Sonos</a>, leading the audio technology company\u2019s grantmaking and social activations. He previously worked at the digital rights organization<a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/\"> Access Now</a>, where he drove campaigns on fighting internet shutdowns, cybersecurity, and online censorship. Olukotun graduated from Yale College and Stanford Law School, and earned a Master\u2019s in creative writing at the University of Cape Town.\u00a0</p><p>If you have any feedback on this episode, please email <a href=\"mailto:podcast@eff.org\">podcast@eff.org</a>.

She is the co-founder and CEO of<a href=\"https://techequitycollaborative.org/\"> TechEquity Collaborative</a>, an organization based in Oakland, CA, that mobilizes tech workers and companies to advocate for economic equity in our communities. She was previously<a href=\"https://codeforamerica.org/\"> Code for America</a>\u2019s Senior Director of Partnerships and Ecosystem, where she grew the Brigade program into a network of over 50,000 civic tech volunteers in more than 80 U.S. cities.

That\u2019s where our podcast comes in.\u00a0\nEFF's\u00a0How to Fix the Internet\u00a0podcast offers a better way forward. Through curious conversations with some of the leading minds in law and technology, we explore creative solutions to some of today\u2019s biggest tech challenges.\nFind the podcast\u00a0via\u00a0RSS,\u00a0Stitcher, TuneIn, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and Spotify.

From hanging chads to glitchy touchscreens to partisan disinformation, too many Americans worry that their votes won\u2019t count and that election results aren\u2019t trustworthy. It\u2019s crucial that citizens have well-justified confidence in this pillar of our republic.</p><p>Technology can provide answers - but that doesn\u2019t mean moving elections online. As president and CEO of the nonpartisan nonprofit Verified Voting, Pamela Smith helps lead the national fight to balance ballot accessibility with ballot security by advocating for paper trails, audits, and transparency wherever and however Americans cast votes.</p><p>On this episode of How to Fix the Internet, Pamela Smith joins EFF\u2019s Cindy Cohn and Danny O\u2019Brien to discuss hope for the future of democracy and the technology and best practices that will get us there.</p><p>In this episode you\u2019ll learn about:</p><ul><li>Why voting online can never be like banking or shopping online</li><li>What a \u201crisk-limiting audit\u201d is, and why no election should lack it</li><li>Whether open-source software could be part of securing our votes</li><li>Where to find reliable information about how your elections are conducted</li></ul><p>If you have any feedback on this episode, please email podcast@eff.org.

Pam joined Verified Voting in 2004, and previously served as President from 2007-2017. She is a member of the National Task Force on Election Crises, a diverse cross-partisan group of more than 50 experts whose mission is to prevent and mitigate election crises by urging critical reforms.

But the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d may not be hardwired for security. Window Snyder, computer security expert and author, joins EFF hosts Cindy Cohn and Danny O\u2019Brien as they delve into the scary insecurities lurking in so many of our modern conveniences\u2014and how we can change policies and tech to improve our security and safety.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/window\">Window Snyder</a> is the founder and CEO of Thistle Technologies. She\u2019s the former Chief Security Officer of Square, Fastly and Mozilla, and she spent five years at Apple focusing on privacy strategy and features for OS X and iOS. Window is also the co-author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Threat-Modeling-Microsoft-Professional-Swiderski/dp/0735619913\">Threat Modeling</a>, a manual for security architecture analysis in software.</p><p>In this episode, Window explains why malicious hackers might be interested in getting access\u00a0 to your refrigerator, doorbell, or printer. These basic household electronics can be an entry point for attackers to gain access to other sensitive devices on your network.\u00a0 Some of these devices may themselves store sensitive data, like a printer or the camera in a kid\u2019s bedroom. Unfortunately, many internet-connected devices in your home aren\u2019t designed to be easily inspected and reviewed for inappropriate access. That means it can be hard for you to know whether they\u2019ve been compromised.</p><p>But the answer is not forswearing all connected devices. Window approaches this problem with some optimism for the future. Software companies have learned, after an onslaught of attacks, to\u00a0 prioritize security. And she covers how we can bring the lessons of software security\u00a0 into the world of hardware devices.\u00a0</p><p>In this episode, we explain:</p><ul><li>How it was the hard costs of addressing security vulnerabilities, rather than the sharp stick of regulation, that pushed many tech companies to start prioritizing cybersecurity.</li><li>The particular threat of devices that are no longer being updated by the companies that originally deployed them, perhaps because that product is no longer produced, or because the company has folded or been sold.</li><li>Why we should adapt our best current systems for software security, like our processes for updating browsers and operating systems, for securing newly networked devices, like doorbells and refrigerators.</li><li>Why committing to a year or two of security updates isn\u2019t good enough when it comes to consumer goods like cars and medical technology.</li><li>Why it\u2019s important for hardware creators to build devices so that they will be able to reliably update the software without \u201cbricking\u201d the device.</li><li>The challenge of covering the cost of security updates when a user only pays once for the device \u2013 and how\u00a0 bundling security updates with new features can entice users to stay updated.</li></ul><p>This podcast is supported by the Alfred P.

Somehow, the mass surveillance of financial transactions has been normalized in the United States, despite the fourth amendment protection in the constitution.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "We don\u2019t always think about what it means to have the information on our devices stay secure, and it may seem like the locks on our phones are enough to keep our private lives private. But there is increasing pressure from law enforcement to leave a back door open on our encrypted devices. Meanwhile, other government agencies, including consumer protection agencies, want more secure devices. We dive into the nuances of the battle to secure our data and our lives, and consider what the future would be like if we can finally end the \u201ccrypto wars\u201d and tackle other problems in society. On this episode, hosts Cindy Cohn and Danny O\u2019Brien are joined by Riana Pfeffercorn from Stanford\u2019s Centre for Internet and Society to talk about device encryption and why it\u2019s important.\u00a0\nIf you have any feedback on this episode, please email podcast@eff.org. Please visit the site page at https://eff.org/pod105 where you\u2019ll find resources \u2013 including links to important legal cases and research discussed in the podcast and a full transcript of the audio.\u00a0\nIn this episode you\u2019ll learn about:\n\nDifferent types of data law enforcement try to gather information from, including \u201cat rest\u201d and \u201cin transit\u201d data.\nThe divide between law enforcement, national security and intelligence communities regarding their stance on strong encryption and backdoors on devices.\nHow the First Amendment plays a role in cryptography and the ability for law enforcement to try to force companies to build certain code into their software.\nHow strong encryption and device security empowers users to voice their thoughts freely.\n\nRiana Pfefferkorn is a Research Scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory. She focuses on investigating and analyzing the U.S. and other governments\u2019 policies and practices for forcing decryption and/or influencing crypto-related design of online platforms and services via technical means and through courts and legislatures.

            "contentSnippet": "There are flaws in the tech we use everyday- from little software glitches to big data breaches, and security researchers often know about them before we do. Getting those issues fixed is not always as straightforward as it should be. It\u2019s not always easy to bend a corporation's ear, and companies may ignore the threat for liability reasons putting us all at risk. Technology and cybersecurity expert Tarah Wheeler joins Cindy Cohn and Danny O\u2019Brien to explain how she thinks security experts can help build a more secure internet.\u00a0\nIf you have any feedback on this episode, please email podcast@eff.org.

They talk through the ramifications of this shift on society, and also start to paint a brighter future for how the digital world would thrive if we safeguard digital first sale.</p> <p>In this episode you\u2019ll learn about:</p> <ul> <li>The legal doctrine of first sale\u2014in which owners of a copyrighted work can resell it or give it away as they choose\u2014and why copyright maximalists have fought it for so long;</li> <li>The Redigi case, in which a federal court held that the Redigi music service, which\u00a0allows music fans to store and resell music they buy from iTunes, violated copyright law\u2014and why that set us down the wrong path;</li> <li>The need for a movement that can help champion digital first sale and access to knowledge more generally;</li> <li>How digital first sale connects to issues of access to knowledge, and how this provides a nexus to issues of societal equity;</li> <li>Why the shift to using terms of service to govern access to content such as music and books has meant that our access to knowledge is intermediated by contract law, which is often impenetrable to average users;</li> <li>How not having a strong right of digital first sale undermines libraries, which have long benefited from bequests and donations;</li> <li>How getting first sale right in the digital world will help to promote equitable access to knowledge and create a more accessible digital world.</li> </ul> <p>Christopher Lewis is President and CEO at Public Knowledge. Prior to being elevated to President and CEO, Chris served for as PK's Vice President from 2012 to 2019 where he led the organization's day-to-day advocacy and political strategy on Capitol Hill and at government agencies. During that time he also served as a local elected official, serving two terms on the Alexandria City Public School Board. Chris serves on the Board of Directors for the Institute for Local Self Reliance and represents Public Knowledge on the Board of the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG).

She is currently the Director of the Fourth Amendment Center at the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. As director, Ms. Musa oversees NACDL's initiative to build a new, more durable Fourth Amendment legal doctrine for the digital age. The Fourth Amendment Center educates the defense bar on privacy challenges in the digital age, provides a dynamic toolkit of resources to help lawyers identify opportunities to challenge government surveillance, and establishes a tactical litigation support network to assist in key cases. Ms. Musa previously served as NACDL's Sr. Privacy and National Security Counsel.</p><p>Prior to joining NACDL, Ms. Musa served as a policy consultant for the Southern Border Communities Coalition, a coalition of over 60 groups across the southwest that address militarization and brutality by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in border communities. Previously, she served as Deputy Director for the Rights Working Group, a national coalition of civil rights, civil liberties, human rights, and immigrant rights advocates where she coordinated the \u201cFace the Truth\u201d campaign against racial profiling. She was also the Advocacy Director for Domestic Human Rights and International Justice at Amnesty International USA, where she addressed the domestic and international impact of U.S. counterterrorism efforts on human rights.
