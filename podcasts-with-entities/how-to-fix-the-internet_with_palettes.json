            "contentSnippet": "Imagine being detained by armed agents whenever you returned from traveling outside the country. That\u2019s what life became like for Academy Award-winning filmmaker Laura Poitras, who was placed on a terrorist watch-list after she made a documentary critical of the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq. Poitras was detained close to 100 times between 2006 and 2012, and border agents routinely copied her notebooks and threatened to take her electronics.\u00a0\nIt was only after Poitras teamed up with EFF to sue the government that she was able to see evidence of the government\u2019s six-year campaign of spying on her. This week on our podcast, Poitras joins EFF\u2019s Cindy Cohn and Danny O\u2019Brien to talk about her continuing work to uncover spying on journalists, and what we can do to fight back against mass surveillance.\u00a0\nIn this episode you\u2019ll learn about:\u00a0\n\nWhat life was like for Poitras when she was placed on a terror watch list and put under FBI surveillance\nWhy security is a \u201cteam sport,\u201d and what we can all do to protect ourselves as well as more vulnerable people\u00a0\u00a0\nPoitras\u2019 new work about the NSO Group, an Israeli spyware company that has been accused of facilitating human rights abuses worldwide\nWhat legal strategies can be used to push back on mass surveillance\nThe role of whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and human rights activists in uncovering spying abuses, and how they can be better protected\nThe laws that we need to protect professional journalists and citizen journalists in an age where anyone can record the news\u00a0\n\nIf you have any feedback on this episode, please email podcast@eff.org.

            "contentSnippet": "Marc Maron is the host of a successful podcast, and when he and some other pioneers started out he didn\u2019t have to think much about the layers of technology he was using, until a patent troll came to call, asking for thousands of dollars to pay for the \u201crights\u201d to\u00a0 podcasting because of a patent they were mis-using to get money from the nascent podcast world. Marc and his producer Brendan knew that if they didn\u2019t take up the fight to stop the trolls, then all of podcasting would be under threat, so they joined up with some EFF lawyers and a whole lot of listeners to win their fight.\u00a0\nIn this episode you\u2019ll learn about:\u00a0\n\nThe prior art, or evidence of earlier technology that EFF was able to present to courts to prove that the so-called \u201cpodcasting patent\u201d was invalid.\nHow the landmark Alice v.

Sanchez explains how the FISA Court signs off on surveillance of huge swaths of our digital lives, and how the format and structure of the FISA Court is inherently flawed.</p> <p>In this episode, you\u2019ll learn about:</p> <ul> <li>How the FISA Court impacts your digital privacy</li> <li>The makeup of the FISA Court and how judges are chosen</li> <li>How almost all of the key decisions about the legality of America's mass Internet spying projects have been made by the FISC</li> <li>How the current system promotes ideological hegemony within the FISA court</li> <li>How the FISC\u2019s endless-secrecy-by-default system insulates it from the ecosystem of jurisprudence that could act as a guardrail against poor decisions as well as accountability for them</li> <li>How the FISC\u2019s remit has ballooned from approving individual surveillance orders to signing off on broad programmatic types of surveillance</li> <li>Why we need a stronger amicus role in the FISC, and especially a bigger role for technical experts to advise the court</li> <li>Specific reforms that could be enacted to address these systemic issues and ensure a more fair review of surveillance systems</li> </ul> <p>Julian is a\u00a0senior fellow at the Cato Institute and studies issues at the intersection of technology, privacy, and civil liberties, with a\u00a0particular focus on national security and intelligence surveillance. Before joining Cato, Julian served as the Washington editor for the technology news site\u00a0<em>Ars Technica</em>, where he covered surveillance, intellectual property, and telecom policy. He has also worked as a\u00a0writer for\u00a0<em>The Economist</em>\u2019s blog\u00a0<em>Democracy in America</em>\u00a0and as an editor for\u00a0<em>Reason</em>\u00a0magazine, where he remains a\u00a0contributing editor. Sanchez has written on privacy and technology for a\u00a0wide array of national publications, ranging from the\u00a0<em>National Review</em>\u00a0to\u00a0<em>The Nation</em>, and is a\u00a0founding editor of the policy blog\u00a0<em>Just Security</em>.
