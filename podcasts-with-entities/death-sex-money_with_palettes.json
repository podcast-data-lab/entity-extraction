As the daughter of two academics growing up in Canada, she preferred books to sports, and liked talking and thinking about the nuances of her faith. \u201cI never really thought about my body very much in time and space,\u201d Kate told Anna. But while starting her career as an academic, Kate\u2019s relationship with her body changed. She was diagnosed with a joint laxity disorder in her 20s. And at 35, not long after having her son, Kate was diagnosed with stage IV cancer, changing her relationship to productivity and rest once again, which she also chronicled in her New York Times best selling memoir, Everything Happens For A Reason (And Other Lies I\u2019ve Loved). Kate tells Anna about the shame of not living up to her own expectations, learning to let go, and what brings her joy.",

At the time, Emma was supporting her family as a sex worker and wrote Anna an email \u2013 she wanted to share her story about how she got into sensual massage and why she didn't feel any guilt about working with married clients. Am I facilitating cheating? \u201cI guess so,\" she wrote. \"Can I sleep at night? Mostly.\" After Anna spoke with Emma that first time, Emma called her back, saying their interview made her realize how much she needed to get away from her job. She canceled her appointments and took some time off. She also asked us not to use her interview. But after a few months, she started seeing clients again \u2013 and told Anna that she wanted to talk. She said she was trying to figure out a way to go back to school and put sex work behind her, but wasn't sure how she'd pull it off. Then, in 2017, Anna reached back out to Emma to check-in and hear about what had happened in Emma\u2019s life since they talked. As it turns out, a lot had changed.",

Her\u00a0\"signature call\"\u2014an operatic bellow that she lets out when I ask to hear it\u2014was legendary in the city. \"They'd be like, 'Oh that's Freddie in the club'.... The signature call comes very loud. And proud.\"</p>\n<p>Freedia came out to her mom as gay when she was 13, and soon came out to her classmates as well. She tells me she \"had to do what every other gay kid had to do: fight for their life, and let people know that you are not no joke.\" She eventually started performing as part of New Orleans' queer bounce music scene, and became a local celebrity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, in\u00a02005, Freedia got shot. \"What the motive was, I don\u2019t know to this day still,\" she says. After finally mustering the courage to start performing again, Freedia also moved into a new place, to get a fresh start. Hurricane Katrina hit about a week later. She and her family were together at her duplex during the storm, where the water rose to the second floor.

This switch means that many local call centers across the country are preparing for a higher volume of calls. And for someone in crisis, it means a lot to hear someone on the line who knows the community they're calling from.</span></p>\n<p><span>In Wyoming, that sort of knowledge can be helpful, and also a deterrent to accessing mental health services. \"We\u2019re very rural. Everybody knows your business,\" Karen Sylvester told me. She's the director of training and fundraising for the Wyoming Lifeline, one of two new call centers in the state that began operating in 2020. \"And so when it comes to somebody struggling, the last place that they want to have their car parked is outside the mental health office.

But, as Maria told me when we spoke back in 2020, the confidence she\u00a0built while\u00a0working in media didn't totally translate to other parts of her life. \"You know, my marriage almost broke up because of my ego,\" she said. And as her career became more successful, she told me about the times she says she didn't prioritize her husband and her kids, about the crisis point that led her to reevaluate her role in her relationship and as a mother, and about how, these days, she is practicing listening and self-love. Plus, I catch up with Maria and she tells me about the significance of the award for her.",

As we grow up, it can be hard to update those relationships that were forged so long ago. You were children together; it can be hard to act like adults together.</p>\n<p>More than 200 of you reached out to tell me your sibling stories. I heard from Alix, whose twin sister, Katie, has cerebral palsy. \u201cEvery time I reach another milestone in my adult life,\u201d she said, \u201cit feels like something that [Katie] can\u2019t ever get to.\u201d Mike told me about sobering up\u00a0at 50\u2014and losing the thing that brought him and his drinking buddy brother together. Paul* reflected on why he feels angry at his big sister, whom he used to look up to. Consuello debated whether or not to let her younger brother come and live with her, after she found out he was homeless.

She and her husband\u00a0have jobs at a seasonal restaurant, where she says they each make about $500 a week. When it gets cold, they go on unemployment to support themselves and their young daughter. Alice supplements that income by shoplifting. \"I do have rules that I follow,\" she explained. \"I don't ever lift from small mom-and-pop kinds of stores. When you lift from somewhere like Walmart they already have it built into their insurance...I would say it feels more like maybe a paper cut, as opposed to stabbing someone.\"</p>\n<p>We first learned about Alice through Tumblr, where there's an active community of people who say they shoplift. They post pictures of their \"hauls,\" as well as tips for other lifters. For Alice, finding that community was huge. \"It felt like I had people that I could talk to about it,\" she told me.\u00a0\"Because it is such a huge part of my life, and to have people that I could talk about it with like it was normal, that felt great. It just sort of opened up a whole new world of possibilities.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alice told us she keeps her shoplifting a secret from her husband. And while she used to steal while her daughter was with her, stuffing\u00a0groceries and makeup into her diaper bag, she says she stopped once her daughter was old enough to understand what was happening. \"I don't want her doing something that's obviously dangerous,\" Alice told us. \"I don't ever see her like being a tag team. I don't really want that for her.\"</p>\n<p>Since first talking with Alice in 2017,\u00a0a lot has happened in Alice's life. We called her back to find out how she and her family fared during the pandemic\u2014and to find out if she's still stealing today.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks to Tasbeeh Herwees for\u00a0her help with this story.

She and her husband\u00a0have jobs at a seasonal restaurant, where she says they each make about $500 a week. When it gets cold, they go on unemployment to support themselves and their young daughter. Alice supplements that income by shoplifting. \"I do have rules that I follow,\" she explained. \"I don't ever lift from small mom-and-pop kinds of stores.

For Alice, finding that community was huge. \"It felt like I had people that I could talk to about it,\" she told me.\u00a0\"Because it is such a huge part of my life, and to have people that I could talk about it with like it was normal, that felt great.

She spoke with me about how her faith was challenged by her family's struggles, how her new relationship has brought religion\u2014not sex\u2014back into her life,\u00a0and why being a single parent is the hardest job in the world.

Amanda says she took on the lion's share of the work at home while also juggling a full-time job that was paying most of their bills.\u00a0\"I was angry with him for not knowing how to help me,\" Amanda says about Sam. When Sam was\u00a0diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma while the kids were still toddlers, she says that neither one of them\u00a0gave it the\u00a0full\u00a0attention it deserved.\u00a0 \"It certainly didn't change the things it should've changed,\" Amanda said. \"Starting with a will would have been nice.\" Sam didn't exhibit many physical symptoms at first, but mentally,\u00a0he started to turn inward after his diagnosis. \"He went to this place of living his life in secret,\" Amanda said. \"And not sharing anything about how it was feeling or what he was doing with me.\" Then, the cancer spread to his spinal column and brain. He was admitted to the hospital and quickly lost consciousness. That's when Amanda discovered, among other secrets, that her husband had been having an affair. She planned to confront Sam\u00a0when he woke up, but he\u00a0never did. Amanda was left with\u00a0a lot of anger\u2014and, as it turned out, money problems\u2014to process. But she had to keep\u00a0most of it to herself. \"My husband was really very well-liked,\" she\u00a0explained. \"You've got to be this plate for everybody else's feelings about your dead husband.\" *Names changed\u00a0",

Garrett says he's found it difficult to be excited about paying off some of their credit cards, while Cora says she wants to celebrate victories as they come. \"This is the thing that is different between straight financial advice and financial therapy,\" Amanda says. \"There may need to be a period of digging into the mess, if you will, of what stands between where you are today and where it is that you'd like to go. It's not as simple as, here's the perfect sort of way to organize this.\u00a0Now, just go do it.\"\u00a0 To hear more of Amanda, check out the NPR podcast Life Kit. In their most recent episode, Amanda goes over some helpful principles of financial intimacy for couples\u2014things she thinks about when counseling\u00a0couples towards healthy financial behaviors, and\u00a0tips you can\u00a0use in your own relationship.

And</span><span>\u00a0I'm curious how you went from my position to your position. Why did you make the plunge?\"</span></p>\n<p><span>There's a lot to consider when trying to decide whether to become a parent. There's your biological clock. The environment. Your financial situation. Your romantic life. Your health. But today, in this episode, we're focusing on the decisions and tradeoffs we make around ambition, desires, and identity when we decide to become parents. </span></p>\n<p><span>I talk with Avery about how being a mom of two has changed my work life, and what I've let go of.\u00a0We hear from artist Julie Mehretu about how being a mom has impacted her art, and comedian Margaret Cho about being at peace with not having kids. And we hear from one mom who decided to radically change the way motherhood looked in her life\u2014and the price she paid for it.\u00a0</span></p>\n",

But she was also\u00a0terrified to admit that she wasn't happy in the relationship. \"He didn\u2019t miss me, the way I missed our closeness, because he was so preoccupied with the disease taking over him,\" she told me. \"That really, really hurt me.\" And many of you told us that coming close to death changed the way that you think about dying. \"It\u2019s not as horrific as I thought it would be,\" said Elizabeth Caplice, who\u00a0described her life as \"one big near-death adventure.\" A listener sent us a link to her blog,\u00a0Sky Between Branches, where she wrote about her life with stage 4\u00a0colorectal cancer. When I talked with her, she'd just been given an estimate of three months to live. \"It obviously is a really terrible and rancid thing to happen to anyone,\" she told me. \"But in a lot of ways it\u2019s simultaneously been worse and not as bad as I thought it would be.\u00a0It is a natural process. It\u2019s a very human thing to have happen to you, is to die.\"\u00a0 This episode was originally released in 2016.

Her acclaimed 2014 book Citizen: An American Lyric\u00a0brought her\u00a0unflinching\u00a0perspective on race relations to the mainstream.\u00a0And in her latest book, Just Us, Claudia examined her own personal interactions with white friends, family, colleagues\u2026and even the strangers she'd\u00a0meet on those work trips. While Claudia's made a name for herself with her reflections on these types of conversations,\u00a0she told me they're not always easy to\u00a0have, including with\u00a0her own husband.\u00a0\"I might say, 'You're only doing that because you're a white guy.' And he'll say, 'Well, you do the same thing.' And I say, \"I may do the same thing, but I don't have the same reception,'\" she said.\u00a0Claudia\u00a0also told me about\u00a0growing up in predominantly white spaces in the Bronx during the 1970s, and how a cancer diagnosis in her 50s allowed her to reassess what she wants out of life.",

I talked with her\u00a0about how she's supported both her\u00a0family and her own ambition at the same time throughout her life, as well as about how she processed\u00a0the\u00a0deaths of her parents, and her younger brother Tino, who was killed in the Vietnam War when he was only 19. Head over to our Instagram page to see some photos of Norma's family that she shared with us. And Norma graciously agreed to read some of her poetry for us, all from her 2019 collection Meditaci\u00f3n Fronteriza: Poems of Love, Life and Labor:\u00a0 My Mother's Hands\u00a0 \u00a0 Song of the Borderland (English) \u00a0 Canto A La Tierra Fronteriza (Espa\u00f1ol) \u00a0 \u00a0",

But when he was given the choice to opt out of the 2020-21 NFL season, the Broncos defensive lineman\u2014now on his seventh season in the NFL\u2014knew he wouldn't\u00a0take that path. \"That could be the end of your career,\" Shelby told me. \"It's just going to be young players\u00a0that come in and perform, and that's how you get your spot taken.\"\u00a0 Shelby is now getting tested for COVID almost daily, and wears a tracker\u00a0while at NFL facilities to monitor whether he's exposed to anyone who tests positive. But his season looks different in other ways than he thought it would too\u2014including the amount of money he's making, and\u00a0the way he's protesting racism and police violence during games. Shelby is currently wearing Elijah McClain's name on his helmet, and as the National Anthem played during the Broncos home opener this year, Shelby took a knee for the first time since 2017. \"I'm doing this because I need to be able to look my kids in the eye when I get older and told them I fought for them,\" Shelby said. \"I want to figure out something that's actually going to make a change.\"\u00a0 This episode is part of our series Game Changer, about how the COVID-19 pandemic has upended the lives and livelihoods of athletes.

And as her career became more successful, she told me about the times she says she didn't prioritize her husband and her kids, about the crisis point that led her to reevaluate her role in her relationship and as a mother, and about how, these days, she is practicing listening and self-love.",

But what got me over that moment...was to become totally engaged in what was happening before me, and the knocking finally stopped without my realizing it.\"\u00a0 This episode is part of our\u00a02016\u00a0Great Guest Takeover series, when several past guests took a turn in the host chair during Anna's maternity leave.

Not seeing anyone. Being around people...felt too painful.\"\u00a0 Elle\u00a0says overall, she's glad she wasn't in that relationship when the pandemic began. But it did mean that she's had to figure out other ways to get touch\u2014including \"germ bonding\" with another couple. For a listener we're calling Dennis, who separated from his wife of 37 years last fall, it hasn't been so simple. He'd started getting into contra dancing pre-pandemic\u2014something that was really helping him get through his divorce. But the weekly dances shut down in March. \"I think it's going to be the last thing to come back. And also the, the crowd is, a lot of us are older,\" he said. \"So it's going to\u00a0be a long time. And it's really sad.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Plus, we hear from a listener\u00a0whose relationship ended during quarantine, after a long-distance conversation about grooming.\u00a0 Thanks to the team at\u00a0Love + Radio\u00a0for\u00a0their work on this collaboration.",

One\u00a0of the people\u00a0who reached out to him was a woman we're calling Dana\u2014and I talked with her, too. Her husband \"John\" is currently at Sing Sing, and while they talk almost every day, not being able to see him has taken a toll on her. \"The anxiety level that I've reached has me physically ill,\" she told me, \"because I don't know if he's really okay.\" \u00a0 We first spoke to Lawrence Bartley back in 2014, which you can listen to here. Our other follow-up episodes with him and his wife Ronnine are available here and here, and be sure to read his recent essay for\u00a0The Marshall Project , called \"How 27 Years In Prison Prepared Me For Coronavirus,\" here. You can find our WNYC colleagues' work here:\u00a0\"Dispatches from People Stranded in Place,\"\u00a0\"Inside the Prison Pandemic,\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Keeping Released Prisoners Safe and Sane.\"\u00a0And don't forget to check out\u00a0the latest season of Ear Hustle. \u00a0",
