                "summary": "When you suffer, it\u2019s natural to ask the question, \u201cWhy?\u201d Instinctively, it\u2019s sometimes the very first thing out of our mouths when tragedy hits: \u201cWhy me? Why this? Why now?\u201d\nThere\u2019s no other book of the Bible or piece of literature that addresses the great why question of suffering with the intellectual and philosophical integrity and deftness, the emotional and dramatic realism, and the spiritual wisdom of the book of Job.\nThis text teaches us three things about the why question of suffering: 1) you have to avoid pat answers, 2) you need to embrace living without an answer, and 3) you need to anticipate the ultimate answer.\u00a0\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 6, 2008. Series: Job - A Path Through Suffering. Scripture: Job 1:8-22.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

The certainty of a material future, the new heavens and new earth, and the certainty that in Christ, that\u2019s coming to you, makes Christianity a distinct, life-shaping force. It distinctly shapes the way in which we live in every area of life.\nWe\u2019re looking now at an area of life that has been a matter of enormous concern to us as a whole world, especially as a society. How do people of different races, cultures, and religions live together in peace?\nThe Christian hope gives us an enormous resource to use on this problem. In Romans 14, Paul shows us 1) the problem, 2) a false solution, 3) the true solution, and 4) the power to do it.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 25, 2004.

Jesus Christ, the little, tender, meek and mild baby, is the Lord of the storm.\u00a0This tells us four things about the power of Christ: 1) the reality of Christ\u2019s power, 2) the magnitude of Christ\u2019s power, 3) the divinity of Christ\u2019s power, and 4) the compatibility of the caring power of Jesus with storms.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 5, 1997.

            "content": "<p>In this series, we\u2019ve been saying beliefs don\u2019t automatically change your life. They have to be instilled into your heart through spiritual disciplines, through Christian practices. I\u2019d like to talk now about a Christian practice you probably don\u2019t think of as a practice\u2014the practice of friendship, especially friendship between believers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Friendship only happens to the degree you work at it. The ancients considered it the most virtuous of all the loves\u2014because it was the most deliberate. The Bible understood, like all ancient people, how important friendship was. The practice of friendship was something Christians were to extend to everybody in their Christian community.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t levels of intensity. Jesus said to his twelve disciples, \u201cYou\u2019re all my friends,\u201d and yet, John was his best friend, and Peter, James, and John were close friends. With some people you practice more intensely, but the Bible says all other believers in your Christian community must be friends. You must practice the disciplines of friendship.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are two great features of friendship. In Galatians 5 and 6, let\u2019s look at 1) the constancy of friendship, 2) the intimacy of friendship, and 3) the power to fulfill them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on June 1, 2008. Series: Practicing The Christian Life.

Let\u2019s look at four ways the Lord\u2019s Supper connects things: 1) it connects the present to the past, 2) it connects your soul to God, 3) it connects the individual to community, and 4) it connects your life story to the future.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 4, 2008.

That\u2019s the reason there are so many people who profess Christianity who are just as selfish as everybody else. Beliefs don\u2019t just produce character. Beliefs have to be turned into character through practices, through spiritual disciplines.\nToday we\u2019re going to be looking at how we are supposed to use Scripture, the Bible, in our lives. Psalm 119 is the longest psalm in the Bible (176 verses), and it\u2019s all about the practical uses of Scripture in our lives. If you want the Scripture to be used in your life to translate beliefs into character, then you have to recognize its majesty, tap its power, and unlock its secret.\u00a0\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 20, 2008.

We\u2019re looking at Psalm 95, which is called the Venite. In Latin, venite is the first word. It\u2019s \u201cO come.\u201d It\u2019s probably the best single place in the Bible to go if we want to understand what worship is all about.\u00a0\nIn this Psalm, we\u2019re going to learn three things about worship: why we should, what it is, and how it\u2019s done.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 6, 2008.

It\u2019s us. It\u2019s city-disdaining, city-phobic, religious, moral, good people. We\u2019re the antagonists, and God is the protagonist.

            "content": "<p>The book of Jonah is really one of the best possible places to get an overview of what the Christian message is about. This passage is about sin. But it doesn\u2019t actually ever use the word sin. And yet, not only does it profoundly map out the real nature of sin, it gives us an understanding of sin that goes deeper than what you\u2019d think the definition of sin is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to believe in sin. It\u2019s another thing to understand it and understand your own heart. We\u2019re going to take a look at four features in the narrative, and each one is going to tell us something about sin. The four features we see are in verse 1. We see the coming word. \u201cThe word of the LORD came \u2026\u201d In verse 3, we see the running man. In verse 5, we see the deathly sleep.

Nobody in their right mind would even think of besieging the city, let alone trying to capture the city, because you couldn\u2019t even get an army around it. Who had an army that could stretch around the circumference of this city? But the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of men, and God decides, not just to besiege the city, but to sack it with an army of one.\nGod did it by taking one man and turning that one man into a city-changer, into a world-changer. Then, by doing so, he was able to sack the greatest city in the history of the world up to that time. How did God make Jonah an army of one? First, God\u2019s persistent grace makes you an army of one. Second, God\u2019s calling makes you an army of one. Thrid, God\u2019s strategy.
