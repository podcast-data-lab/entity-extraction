And on the night before Jesus is about to die, he\u2019s talking about the Holy Spirit.\u00a0\nWhy is Jesus so constantly talking about the Holy Spirit? I think we see at least two reasons. One is a hard reason, at least it\u2019s hard to hear. And one is a wonderful reason.\u00a0\nI think the two reasons that Jesus thinks the Holy Spirit is so important to talk about, so crucial to understand, so important to have, is because 1) without the Holy Spirit there\u2019s no remedy for our spiritual blindness and cluelessness, but 2) with the Holy Spirit, we can be taken into realms of experience and transformation that we can\u2019t imagine.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 26, 2017.

But the second you stop tending a fire, it burns down. See, if you\u2019ve never found God, or if you have but it\u2019s been a long time, for both, this passage tells you the path. Because basically the path of \u201cnew-al\u201d and the path of renewal are the same.\u00a0\nHow do you find God the first time? How do you find him again and again? We learn here 1) that we desperately need renewal, and 2) how we get renewal.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 2, 1997. Series: Pointers to Christ \u2013 Directional Signs in History. Scripture: Exodus 33:4-9, 15; 34:1-7.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

And what does the Christian vision of marriage have to say for that?\nWe believe that understanding the biblical vision for marriage will help you no matter your own situation. We\u2019re applying it to the culture. We're applying it to unmarried people. We're applying it to married people.\nKathy and I will each talk about different aspects of this. We\u2019ll look at 1) marriage and our culture, and 2) the biblical contours of marriage: the power, the essence, the purpose, and the three major means of marriage.\nThis talk was given by Dr. Timothy Keller and Kathy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 30, 2012 for the conference \"Marriage, Sex & Singleness Conference\".\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

                "summary": "Depending on the culture it\u2019s sitting in, Christianity can either be considered radically liberal or horribly conservative. But Christianity isn\u2019t to the left or to the right. In fact, if it\u2019s true that Christianity doesn\u2019t arise from the human spectrum of thought, but that it comes from above, then it\u2019s natural that it doesn\u2019t fit any particular ideology\u2014and that every ideology is going to be suspicious of it.\u00a0\nIn a series on marriage, we come now to the question of whether there\u2019s any differentiation between the roles and obligations of a husband and wife in marriage. And the basic thesis in Ephesians 5 is that being male and being female are overlapping but distinguishable ways of being human.\u00a0\nI\u2019d like to show that Ephesians 5 teaches us 3 things about gender roles: 1) there are roles, 2) why there are roles, and 3) what those roles are.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 29, 1991. Series: Marriage. Scripture: Ephesians 5:22-33.\nToday's podcast episode is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

But the real question is, are they insurmountable? Can we find a way through them?\nI\u2019d like to give you something to consider as a possible way through: it\u2019s important to see 1) that people\u2019s problems with religion are themselves beliefs which in turn have their own problems, and 2) that Christianity has a unique resource for each of these problems.\nThis talk was given by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 9, 2003.

There\u2019s no way around it.\u00a0\nThe context is Jesus telling us about John the Baptist, who realized the kingdom of heaven is real. Then Jesus says the kingdom of heaven comes with violence. This bothers us. Isn\u2019t this Jesus? Isn\u2019t this the one who said, \u201cturn the other cheek?\u201d Yes. That\u2019s the reason why Jesus uses this term. Jesus is a communicator. He knows by saying this you\u2019re going to be startled. You\u2019re going to say, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u00a0\nLet\u2019s cooperate with him. Let\u2019s ask, what is this holy violence? Let\u2019s look at 1) what it\u2019s not, 2) what it is, and 3) why we need it.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on June 3, 1992. Series: Hard Sayings of Jesus (1993).

It tells us so much about what it means to be a Christian and what it means to really meet God.\nIn this passage, Isaiah\u2019s just going to the temple like he\u2019s gone to the temple hundreds of times before. It\u2019s the Sabbath day. He walks into the temple, and the very last person in the whole world he expects to actually see is God.\nThis passage tells us four characteristics of the Christian experience: 1) the reality, 2) the diversity, 3) the beauty, and 4) the festivity.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 24, 1996.

In other words, God connects his presence to something visible, something tangible. There\u2019s only one object, however, in all the history of the Bible, that God routinely attached his presence to, and that was the ark of the covenant.\nLet\u2019s look at what the ark is and what happens in this incident. Then we\u2019ll look at what it teaches us about getting close to God. It shows us that 1) the presence of God is never permanently connected to any one object or method, but 2) his presence is always attached to several principles.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 6, 1996. Series: Daring to Draw Near.
