Every situation will have its particularities, but the similarities are greater than the differences.\nI\u2019d like to talk about how to live godly lives in Christ under any of our circumstances.\nThis talk was given by Kathy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 1, 2014 for the conference \"S1NGLE: God\u2019s Gifts \u2014 Our Plans\".\nToday's podcast episode is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

Whether you believe in God or you don\u2019t believe in God, you still have these two problems. Because they get at something that really is a problem. But the real question is, are they insurmountable?

What he does mean is actually something almost the opposite, that if you think you can separate and create levels of truthfulness, you\u2019re wrong. Everything is observed. Every yes and every no is an oath.\u00a0\nJesus is teaching us 1) the importance of truthfulness, 2) the nature of truthfulness, and 3) how you become a person of integrity.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 14, 1993.

Jesus says the man gives the bread not because the other man is his friend but because of the man\u2019s boldness. Other ways to translate the word Jesus uses include shamelessness, rudeness, discourtesy, impertinence, and impudence. That\u2019s what Jesus says is a model for our prayer. \u201cPray like that,\u201d he says. \u201cBother God.\u201d\u00a0\nWhy should we pray this way? Jesus gives the answer: 1) it\u2019s a way to judge our hearts today, and 2) it\u2019s a way to actually live our lives tomorrow in a different way.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 31, 1993.

                "summary": "In this cultural moment, when our non-Christian friends look at the Christian faith, they often see a history of racism, an anti-intellectual mindset, homophobia, and the denigration of women.\u00a0\nIt's tempting to think that the best thing Christians can do is batten down the hatches and cling on for dear life, while the waves of secularization wash over us. But if that's what we think, I believe we've got it all wrong. When we look more closely at each of these devastating roadblocks, they become signposts to Christ.\u00a0\nI believe we have an opportunity before us. But there are four things we need to do. We must reclaim 1) diversity, 2) the university, 3) morality, and 4) sexuality. But we must do all these things with humility and not by watering the scriptures down, but by lapping them up.\nThis talk was given by Dr. Rebecca McLaughlin at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 14, 2019.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "If you\u2019re reading through the book of Isaiah, you get to this passage and you\u2019re shocked. Up until now, Isaiah indicates that God\u2019s going to send a great king to put things right in the world. Then Isaiah starts talking about a servant. But then, here in chapter 52 and 53, he says this person has no majesty. He has no majesty? Well, who is this?\u00a0\nIt\u2019s surprising and it\u2019s shocking. It subverts every human category of thought about salvation.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s look at three ways in which it\u2019s so surprising, and see what this teaches about the salvation Jesus Christ brings. Let\u2019s notice 1) the ordinariness, 2) the violence, and 3) the vicariousness.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 21, 2016.

                "summary": "We\u2019re wrapping up a series tonight, where we\u2019ve been tracing the single story of the Bible. The Bible is not a set of individual stories that tell you how you should live in order to find God. The Bible is a single story about how God came to earth to find you.\u00a0\nThe beginning of that story is in Genesis, where we learn what\u2019s wrong with us. The middle of that story is in Romans, where we learn what God did through Jesus Christ to put things right. We\u2019re now looking at the book of Revelation, where it tells us how all things work out in the end.\u00a0\nHere, in the last chapter of the last book of the Bible, we have the final vision of God\u2019s future and what he is preparing for us. Let\u2019s ask three questions: 1) What is it? 2) How does it arrive? and 3) How can you be sure that you belong to it?\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 26, 2009. Series: Bible: The Whole Story - Redemption and Restoration. Scripture: Revelation 22:1-11.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

Now we look at Romans 1 through 4, at perhaps the single most comprehensive place where we learn what God has done to make things right.\nScholars of Romans believe verses 16 and 17 are Paul\u2019s way of putting the gospel in a nutshell. Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, said these two verses brought about his own breakthrough, where he was completely transformed by pondering on these verses.\nIf these two verses have never done to you what they did to Luther, I\u2019m going to try to show you three factors you have to grasp if you\u2019re going to break through. According to this text, you have to grasp 1) the form of the gospel, 2) the content of the gospel, and 3) the power of the gospel.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 8, 2009. Series: Bible: The Whole Story - Creation and Fall. Scripture: Romans 1:1-7, 14-17.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

The Bible begins with a marriage in Genesis 2, and at the end, in Revelation, it ends with a marriage and the wedding supper of the Lamb. In some ways, you can understand what the whole Bible is about and what the gospel is about in terms of marriage.\nIn Genesis 2, we have the first wedding. Let\u2019s ask the text a question: how can we be successful in seeking out marriage and in actually being married?\u00a0\nThere are three things the text says you need if you\u2019re going to be married well: 1) attentiveness to idolatry, 2) patience for a very long journey, and 3) supernatural humility.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 4, 2009.

But Habakkuk says it\u2019s possible to face disaster and still have a life of sustained joy in the midst of it.\nHabakkuk has learned that the great Babylonian Empire is going to crush his country. It\u2019s an absolute social disaster. What does it mean, then, to rejoice in your suffering? Not for your suffering, but in your suffering?\u00a0\nWe\u2019re going to learn four things about rejoicing in suffering: 1) what it is, 2) when it happens, 3) how it\u2019s done, and 4) why it\u2019s possible.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on June 7, 2009.

But this situation in which Abraham has a meeting with God is one of the weirdest stories in the Bible.

When God responds, Abraham knows what\u2019s going on: a covenant ratification ceremony. This was the making of a contract.

Scripture: Job 13:20-24; 14:7-17.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

                "summary": "At the actual moment of Jesus\u2019 death, an inexplicable, mysterious darkness comes down. From noon to 3:00 PM, it was absolutely dark.\nThis is an inexplicable darkness. A solar eclipse does not create absolute darkness for more than a few minutes. Besides that, a solar eclipse can\u2019t happen during a full moon, and it was Passover, which is a time of a full moon. Beyond that, it was the wet season, so you can\u2019t attribute it to a desert wind storm. This is a supernatural darkness, and therefore it means something.\nBut what? What does it signify? I think we\u2019ll see that it signifies 1) the darkness we have, 2) the darkness Jesus received, and 3) how Jesus\u2019 darkness can dispel our darkness.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 25, 2007. Series: King's Cross: The Gospel of Mark, Part 2: The Journey to the Cross.

                "summary": "Confucius, Muhammad, Buddha, Moses\u2014they all died in old age, in comfort and blessedness, triumphant over their opponents. Of all the founders of major religions, Jesus alone died alone, young, stripped naked, stared at, mocked, while he died by inches in agony, crying out to God who had forsaken him.\nWho, hearing that story, would say, \u201cThat\u2019s the spiritual leader I want\u201d? And yet, the suffering and death of Jesus Christ transformed lives at a depth and on a scale that completely changed the ancient world. People\u2019s lives were changed if they grasped the understanding of Jesus\u2019 death that he gave at the Last Supper. So what did Jesus say?\nThere are three things we see here: 1) the importance of his death, 2) the meaning of his death, and 3) how it can be a transforming power in your life.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 4, 2007.
