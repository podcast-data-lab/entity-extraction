We learn about 1) the ruin of Cain, 2) the culture of death, and 3) the future city of grace.\u00a0\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 1, 2009. Series: Bible: The Whole Story - Creation and Fall. Scripture: Genesis 4:11-26.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

In her 1925 diary, Beatrice Webb, one of the architects of the modern British welfare system, says there\u2019s something wrong with us that leads to selfishness and violence, corruption in business and government, war and atrocities\u2014and that it\u2019s consistent across history. Science hasn\u2019t dealt with it. Education hasn\u2019t dealt with it. Social machinery hasn\u2019t dealt with it. Who will explain it? Chapters 3 and 4 of Genesis do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with this very famous text, and let\u2019s notice four features of the narrative: 1) the sneer, 2) the lie, 3) the tree, and 4) the call.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 11, 2009.

If that\u2019s all it was, then basically the Bible would be about you and what you must do. Read rightly, the Bible is not about you\u2014it\u2019s about him and what he has done. A single storyline moves from creation to the fall to what he has done to rescue you and renew the world through grace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We start, obviously, at Genesis 1. This tells us the beginning of the story of the world. And if you look carefully at the first three verses, you actually get a glimpse of what was going on before the beginning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We see three things before the beginning: 1) there was God, 2) there was love, and 3) there was darkness.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 16, 2008.

The little book of Habakkuk talks about how to handle evil times, and in particular, it describes an economic disaster.\nHabakkuk\u2019s answer for dealing with economic scarcity is fuller than you might think because he alludes to the Old Testament principle of the firstfruits, where you were supposed to give the firstfruits of your harvest to God. But here, Habakkuk brings up the possibility of having no harvest at all.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re going to learn three things about financial giving: 1) you should give sacrificially, not just out of surplus, 2) you should give joyfully, not just out of duty, and 3) you should give graciously.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 31, 2009.

He does not say, \u201cMy revelations are bigger or better.\u201d Oh, no.

After this, he\u2019s a changed man.\nTo understand this narrative, we have to 1) look at the whole scope of Jacob\u2019s life and how this brings it all together, and then 2) draw out four practical conclusions for us today.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 8, 1996. Series: Daring to Draw Near. Scripture: Genesis 32:22-32.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

                "summary": "There\u2019s more emphasis in our culture on getting and spending money, on consuming goods, than in any culture in history. In his book, The Real American Dream: A Meditation on Hope, Andrew Delbanco says we\u2019ve lost the sense that there\u2019s something beyond this world, so we use money to distract ourselves from the fear that our lives aren\u2019t going anywhere.\nPaul agrees with that, that what you believe your ultimate future to be will have a huge impact on how you use your money. In these two famous chapters in 2 Corinthians, Paul talks about money. He says there\u2019s a way to use your money that will make your life an exciting story.\nIf you want to have that, you have to see three things: 1) there is a problem, 2) there is a key to the problem, and 3) there is a power to use the key.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 2, 2004. Series: Living in Hope. Scripture: 2 Corinthians 8:8-15, 9:6-12.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

                "summary": "In the first half of the crucifixion account, there\u2019s a theme. That theme is the fact that Jesus is mocked, insulted, jeered at, laughed at, humiliated, and shamed.\nThe soldiers are jeering at him, spitting on him. He is stripped naked and crucified naked. The passersby are insulting him. The religious leaders are mocking him. And at the very end, even the thieves on the crosses beside him are making fun of him, insulting him.\nJesus didn\u2019t only get killed on the cross\u2014he also got shamed and humiliated. This is important because it teaches us three things: 1) the mocking tells us about our own hearts, 2) the mocking reveals Jesus\u2019 heart, and 3) if we let it, the mocking can change our hearts so ours become like his.\u00a0\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 18, 2007.

The fact that Jesus struggles with his death is not only unique in ancient history, it\u2019s actually almost unique in church history itself.\nThis passage in Mark 14 helps us 1) see that it all really happened, 2) understand we have a culture, 3) come to grips with the wrath of God, 4) discover a way to deal with trouble and suffering, and 5) get the power to use that method.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 11, 2007. Series: King's Cross: The Gospel of Mark, Part 2: The Journey to the Cross.

Romans 8:1-4.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

In other words, the way you know you\u2019re really moving toward God is you feel you\u2019re too far from him.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 19, 1997.

In the last 1500 years in the West, there has always been indifference to Jesus; but never have there been so many people who are offended at Jesus. John the Baptist is in the same place. When in prison, he sends Jesus a message, and he says, \u201cI don\u2019t know that you\u2019re the One. Are you the Messiah? How do I know?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Jesus\u2019 response, we see three groups of people that don\u2019t take offense at Jesus: the poor, the violent, and the least.

So our theme comes in the form of a question: should we always forgive?\nForgiveness is always easy when you\u2019re asking someone else to give it. And it\u2019s always hard when someone\u2019s asking you to give it. A lot of people have problems with forgiveness. They say forgiveness seems to make light of what was done wrong, or they say they can\u2019t forgive unless the other person asks for forgiveness. But if you look at the whole story arch of the operas, you know that whenever people fail to forgive, bad things happen.\nThis Open Forum, with a talk and open mic Q&A, is specifically designed for skeptics or those wrestling with the claims of Christianity.
