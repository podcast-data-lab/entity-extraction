It\u2019s a pretty formidable argument. What do we say to it?\u00a0\nLet\u2019s first look at why getting rid of your belief in God in order to understand evil and suffering will not help. And then three ways, according to Peter, we can face suffering and evil in our lives. Peter says you have to look back to something, you have to look ahead to something, and you have to look into something to handle evil and suffering in this world.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 1, 2006.

                "summary": "<p>Why are Christians more quiet about their faith now than in past generations and how can one feel confident to share their love for Christ openly and winsomely? In this talk, Tim Keller asks this question: In its early days, when there was great social cost to becoming a Christian, how did the Christian church grow?</p>\n<p>You'll hear the answer through the example of the woman at the well. After she encountered Jesus, she had a joy inside her that she couldn't keep in, as she shared the hope she had in Christ's unique offer of salvation. She wanted people she knew to know who Jesus was to her, and her honest and organic testimony was a hopeful, simple and a natural outcome of encountering Christ.</p>\n<p>This talk was given by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 17, 2019.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

This is what we\u2019re going to see as we look at this passage and put it in the context of David\u2019s whole life and, therefore, the rest of the book of 1 Chronicles.\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>We\u2019ll see three things as we study the passage: 1) What David wanted for his people; 2) How David gave it to them: and 3) How we can have even more of it than they did.\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 18, 2007. Series: Real Spirituality - Prayer and Beyond. Scripture: 1 Chronicles 29:6-20.</p>\r\n\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

You go to a Christmas service or even a Christmas party, and a couple of people say a couple of words. You come and you sing Christmas carols with sort of dreamy and happy faces. That\u2019s good, because we\u2019re immediately connecting Christmas to family, reunions, gifts, time off from work, and things like that. We settle for too little though, because the meaning of Christmas is inexhaustible. It\u2019s filled with theologically powerful, life-changing truths.</p>\r\n\n<p>Our passage from John 1 today helps us understand the meaning of the events around Christmas. We\u2019re going to simply meditate on three aspects of the most pregnant part of this famous passage, verse 14: 1) Jesus is the Word of God; 2) Jesus is our counselor; and 3) the real becomes ideal.\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 13, 2009.

Wisdom has to do with knowing something about the way the world works so that you can make the right decision when you\u2019re faced with multiple options that are morally permissible. This doesn\u2019t necessarily happen with more education, or by being a world traveler, or by becoming more sophisticated. The secrets of wisdom are locked in your ordinary experiences if you know how to learn from them.</p>\r\n\n<p>According to the book of Proverbs, there are two particularly common experiences, and when you\u2019re in either of these two situations, you are in both a moment of great spiritual danger and a moment of great spiritual opportunity. There are tests, and if you pass the tests, you\u2019ll become wiser about yourself, the world, and about human nature. If you fail, you\u2019ll actually become more of a fool. We\u2019re going to ask these three questions: 1) what are the tests, 2) why do they work, and 3) how we can pass.\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 23, 2005.

You make or break your life on the basis of your choices and we need wisdom to make the right ones. For example, is this the right career for you? Is this the right person to marry? Is this the right place to live? In every one of those situations, the options in front of you are many. Most of them are moral and most of them are legal. Most of them are allowable, but most of them aren\u2019t wise.\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>We need guidance to make decisions. How do you get God\u2019s guidance? We\u2019re going to look at a few different proverbs to see 1) the guidance God does; 2), the guidance God gives; and 3) the guidance God purchases for us.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 12, 2004.

We\u2019ve defined wisdom according to the Bible as \u201ccompetence with regard to the complex realities of life.\u201d This means being wise is knowing something about the way the world works in order to make the right moral decision. It\u2019s not enough to just know the rules, but we need to have wisdom so that we can apply the rules appropriately in all types of life situations.\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>We are technically-oriented as a society, so generally we want a technique when it comes to rules. However, the book of Proverbs does not give you methods by which you can make wise decisions. Instead, it says, \u201cHere's the kind of person you have to become who makes wise decisions.\u201d Today we\u2019re going to focus on pride and humility, and we\u2019ll learn about three things: the diagnosis of pride (what it is); the destructiveness of pride (what it does); and the antidote for pride.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 14, 2004.

It\u2019s knowing what the right decision to make is \u2014 what the right course of action is \u2014 in the vast majority of life situations the moral rules don\u2019t address.\n\r\n\nIf you\u2019re going to live a wise life, you need to understand anger. You need to be able to understand and handle anger, not only in yourself, but in other people as well. There are four things we\u2019re going to learn about anger that you have to know to be wise: its power; its goodness; \u00a0why it goes wrong; and how it can be healed.\n\r\n\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 17, 2004. Series: Proverbs: True Wisdom for Living. Scripture: Proverbs 14:29-30; 15:1, 18; 16:32; 19:11, 19; 24:28-29; 25:21-22.\n\r\n\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

            "content": "<p>All of our personal problems and practical problems are really theological ones. Most theological problems are really practical problems, because theology affects the way you live. Today we\u2019re going to look at one huge problem. There\u2019s a theological way to put it, and there\u2019s a more practical way to put it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>The theological problem is this: when you are saved, how do you move beyond being accepted by God as righteous to actually living a righteous life? This is a move from imputed righteousness to imparted righteousness. The more practical way is fairly simple. When you become a Christian, you realize you\u2019re forgiven and that God loves you, but you may continue to see sins in your life that continue to pop up. How do you move beyond that? How do you actually grow in the faith and become more like Christ? Paul gives us a radical answer: the way you enter the Christian faith is exactly the same way you advance in the Christian faith.

Most theological problems are really practical problems, because theology affects the way you live. Today we\u2019re going to look at one huge problem. There\u2019s a theological way to put it, and there\u2019s a more practical way to put it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>The theological problem is this: when you are saved, how do you move beyond being accepted by God as righteous to actually living a righteous life? This is a move from imputed righteousness to imparted righteousness. The more practical way is fairly simple. When you become a Christian, you realize you\u2019re forgiven and that God loves you, but you may continue to see sins in your life that continue to pop up. How do you move beyond that? How do you actually grow in the faith and become more like Christ? Paul gives us a radical answer: the way you enter the Christian faith is exactly the same way you advance in the Christian faith.

People don\u2019t want to be told how to live decently, because that whole idea that there\u2019s a certain way to live is gone. But they\u2019re empty, and they want spirituality. This text from Galatians has everything to say about spirituality. Paul says, \u201cIf you want to understand spiritual power, spiritual reality\u2026 not just an ethical life, but a spiritually powerful life\u2026 here it is.\u201d</p>\r\n\n<p>How did the Galatian Christians get converted?
