                "summary": "Last Friday, both chambers of Congress passed an infrastructure bill that will commit more than one trillion dollars to America\u2019s deteriorating roads and bridges, making life easier for pedestrians and bikers, improving broadband access, and renovating suffering public transit systems.\nThis bill has been closely tied to Biden\u2019s Build Better Back, legislation that would invest heavily in climate change and social policies. While the bill had passed the Senate in July, Progressive Democrats in the House had wanted to hold out on passing the bill until Build Better Back first passed.But mustering support for that initiative has been challenging for Democrats, including from within their own party. Last week, West Virginia senator Joe Manchin suggested his refusal to support the bill was because it didn\u2019t share enough of the other side\u2019s interests.\n\"While I've worked hard to find a path to compromise, it's obvious: Compromise is not good enough for a lot of my colleagues in Congress. It's all or nothing, and their position doesn't seem to change unless we agree to everything,\" Manchin said in a press conference.\nThough Manchin and fellow Democrat Arizona senator Krysten Sinema have insisted that their holding out is part of a commitment to look out for the interests of everyone, some suggest that their posture is actually selfish.\"It is simply not fair, not right that one or two people say: My way or the highway,\" said Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.\nAmy E. Black is professor of political science at Wheaton College and author of several books, including Honoring God in Red or Blue: Approaching Politics with Humility, Grace, and Reason.\nBlack joined global media manager Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to discuss what compromise is, why Christians often make it harder for Christian leaders to practice it, and why politicans have become so loathe to work across the aisle.\nWhat is Quick to Listen?

The missile destroyed a parked car that military officials said was operated by an Islamic State sympathizer, and contained explosives for a suicide attack on the Kabul airport, where American forces and civilians had gathered for evacuation. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told a news conference, \u201cWe think that the procedures were correctly followed and it was a righteous strike.\u201d\nLast week, separate investigations from The New York Times and The Washington Post questioned those assertions, reporting that the driver was Zemari Ahmadi, a longtime engineer for the California-based aid group Nutrition and Education International. The supposed explosives, said the Times, were canisters of water Ahmadi was bringing home to his family because Taliban\u2019s takeover of the city had cut off his neighborhood\u2019s water.\nThe Times also reported that 10 members of the Ahmadi family were killed in the Hellfire missile attack, including seven children.\nGeneral Milley told reporters, \u201cWe went through the same level of rigor that we've done for years. Yes, there are others killed. Who they are, we don't know. We'll try to sort through all that.\u201d\nThe British-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism has counted that the US military conducted more than 13,000 drone strikes in Afghanistan over the years, with at least 4,126 people killed, including at least 300 civilians and 66 children. Drone policies changed over the years under during different presidencies. As did the way the US counted civilian deaths by drone strikes. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has a dramatically higher count for civilians killed in Afghanistan by drones: more than 2,000, with more 785 of them children. If accurate, that would mean that about 40 percent of civilians killed by drones in Afghanistan were children.\nIt appears that drone warfare will continue to play a major role in Afghanistan. Earlier this month, President Biden promised Islamic State\u2014or ISIS-K, \u201cWe are not done with you yet. \u2026 We will hunt you down to the ends of the Earth, and you will pay the ultimate price.\u201d But without troops in the country, that hunting will almost certainly be done mostly through unmanned aircraft.\nBack in 2011, CT ran a story asking \u201cIs it wrong to kill by remote control?\u201d This week, we want to revisit that question.\nOur guest this week is Paul D. Miller, is professor of the practice of international affairs at Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service. He earlier served in the US army, the CIA, and on the National Security Council staff as director for Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nThese days, in addition to his post at Georgetown, he is a research fellow with the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and is author of Just War and Ordered Liberty, published earlier this year from Cambridge University Press.

The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and left 25,000 people injured and were organized by Osama bin Laden, who used his faith as justification for the attacks. Several days after September 11, 2001, President Bush addressed the country:\nThese acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith. And it's important for my fellow Americans to understand that.\nThe English translation is not as eloquent as the original Arabic, but let me quote from the Koran, itself: In the long run, evil in the extreme will be the end of those who do evil. For that they rejected the signs of Allah and held them up to ridicule.\nThe face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war.\nWhen we think of Islam we think of a faith that brings comfort to a billion people around the world. Billions of people find comfort and solace and peace.

                "summary": "On Wednesday, Haiti\u2019s president Jovenel Mo\u00efse was assassinated. His death came after protesters had demanded his departure for months. Mo\u00efse had governed the country of 11 million by decree, even as constitutional scholars and legal experts argued that his term in office had already expired.\nWhile the country has long struggled with poverty and unrest, the situation had been exacerbated in recent months as violent gangs had kidnapped children and pastors. Haiti first became a nation after its enslaved population overthrew their French enslavers. But Western nations, scared lest they send the wrong message to the enslaved, launched a trade boycott against the country, greatly impoverishing it for decades. During the 20th century, the US occupied the island from 1915 to 1934. After it left, the country endured several dictatorships and western powers-supported government overthrows.The country has also not been rebuilt after an earthquake devastated it in 2011.Guenson and Claudia Charlot are co-pastors of\u00a0Discipleship Evangelical Church. Guenson is the president of Emmaus University of Haiti and Claudia is the director of Hand Up Micro Credit.\nThe Charlots joined global media manager Morgan Lee and executive editor Ted Olsen to discuss how Haiti\u2019s hard history has affected its theology, what keeps the church going in the midst of political and socioeconomic despair, and how American missions organizations have helped and hurt the island.\nWhat is Quick to Listen?

Driscoll gained national attention for the popularity of his church in a largely secular part of the US, but also for his own brash, at times crude, irreverent, and caustic temperament. For years, to the public, this largely manifested in his sermons. But over time, rumors of his abusive leadership style began to emerge.\nUpon accepting his resignation, Mars Hill Church\u2019s board of overseers stated that Driscoll had \u201cbeen guilty of arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner,\" but had \"never been charged with any immorality, illegality or heresy. Most of the charges involved attitudes and behaviors reflected by a domineering style of leadership.\u201dPrior to his resignation, church planting network Acts 29 had removed Driscoll, its founder, from leadership and Driscoll had also apologized for previous controversy, including plagiarism and making crude comments.\nAfter he stepped down, Mars Hill church disbanded, with many of the sites closing or becoming their own independent church. Today, Driscoll leads Trinity Church in Scottsdale, which he founded in 2016.\nThis week on Quick to Listen, we wanted to revisit this story, partially because it\u2019s the topic of a new Christianity Today twelve-part podcast called The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill. But also because so many elements of this story remain influential in how the evangelical world works today.\nMike Cosper is CT\u2019s director of podcasts and the host of Cultivated and The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill. Cosper joined global media manager Morgan Lee and executive editor Ted Olsen to discuss how masculinity played a role in Mars Hill\u2019s popularity, why polity mattered to its success and struggles, and what happened to the church after its celebrity pastor departed.\nWhat is Quick to Listen?

Home to nearly 1.4 billion people\u2014or more than one billion more people than the US\u2014the country is anxious about its future. Under its current demographic trajectory, China\u2019s labor force is shrinking, numbers which concern economists and government officials.\nChina first began to regulate its population in the late 1970s, under what become known as the one-child policy, although two-child exceptions were made to ethnic minorities and Han families in rural areas who had daughters first. In 2015, the government began to allow all families to have two children. Despite these changes to the law, births have fallen for four years in a row.

He is currently enrolled in a PhD program at Talbot School of Theology at Biola University and is a licensed counselor based in northeast China. He has done marriage and family counseling for more than 10 years.\nYang joined global media manager Morgan Lee and senior news editor Kate Shellnutt to discuss why abortion is prevalent among Chinese Christians, why the church rarely talks about sex, and how his family made the agonizing decision to have two children.\nWhat is Quick to Listen?

                "summary": "Last year, the US birthrate experienced its largest single-year drop in nearly 50 years. For years, America\u2019s 2.1 fertility rate made it an outlier to other developed countries. But for the last decade, the number had begun trending downwards, plummeting to last year\u2019s figure of 1.6 children per woman.\nThese numbers entered the news the same week the New York Times published an essay by columnist Elizabeth Bruenig, \u201cI Became a Mother at 25, and I\u2019m Not Sorry I Didn\u2019t Wait.\u201d Many warmly received and shared the piece, which explores the author\u2019s experience of learning she was pregnant and the many factors that have caused millennial women to delay children including economic concerns, higher education, race, and geography. But for others, it struck a nerve.\nOne NYT commenter wrote, \u201cThere are few things more irresponsible than bringing a child into the world in 2021. I know it's difficult to reject the incredible social and cultural pressure that encourages us to reproduce. The easiest thing to do will always be to have children. But a good rule of thumb is that the easiest option-- the one our current paradigm encourages-- generally causes the most damage and suffering.\u201d\nOn Twitter, Jill Filipovic wrote, \u201cI would really love to read more essays and op/eds from women (and men, too) who regret having children as early as they did, regret having as many as they did, or regret having children at all. There's not much about motherhood that remains publicly unexplored, but that does.\u201d\nRebecca McLaughlin is the author of Confronting Christianity, named Christianity Today's 2020 Beautiful Orthodoxy Book of the Year, and it's follow-up edition for youth, 10 Questions Every Teen Should Ask (and Answer) about Christianity. Her latest book is The Secular Creed: Engaging Five Contemporary Claims. She joined global media manager Morgan Lee and executive editor Ted Olsen to discuss the challenges of talking about babies and motherhood in 2021 in the culture at large but also inside the church.\nWhat is Quick to Listen?

                "summary": "In 2019, 400,000 people around the world died of malaria. But it may never reach that high a number again.\nEarly trials of a new vaccine have been shown to be 77 percent effective. This is not the first vaccine that has attempted to fight the deadly mosquito-transmitted disease. But it is the only one that has had this level of efficacy.\nThis news comes when COVID-19 vaccines dominate the international discussion. Some wealthier nations, most notably the United States, have prioritized vaccinating their own people first. This week, however, the Biden administration did announce it would be sharing its enormous stockpile of Astrazenca doses. Other countries, like China and Russia, have been shipping their vaccines around the world, though some have questioned their efficacy.\nMany poorer countries have worried that they might wait years for their people to be vaccinated and be left with other countries\u2019 lower-quality leftovers.It also comes as scientists have begun thinking through the ways MRNA technology, which was used to develop the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, might be used to combat other diseases.\nThis week on Quick to Listen, we wanted to discuss the good news about the malaria vaccine, how this will affect Christian humanitarian work around the world, and what it looks like to be a good neighbor when it comes to vaccine distribution.\nWhat is Quick to Listen?

                "summary": "Transcribed highlights of the show can be found in our episode summaries.\nOne third of San Francisco public schools will be renamed in the coming months following a decision by the city\u2019s school board to remove the names of individuals who had owned slaves, actively participated in segregation, or were colonizers.\nThe decision, which includes 44 school sites, attracted national attention as it includes schools named for Thomas Jefferson Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt.The decision has drawn scorn from conservatives who see the decision as yet another example of liberal hysteria but also from other liberals. Last week, The New Yorker\u2019s Isaac Chotiner grilled Gabriela L\u00f3pez, the head of San Francisco Board of Education who refuted some of the historical claims that had been made by the committee which had investigated the named figures. (Read the interview.)\nBut the government isn\u2019t the only actor wrestling over questions of renaming institutions. As Ravi Zacharias\u2019s misdeeds have been exposed in recent months, the ministry named after him has wrestled with whether or not it should continue to bear his name.Of course, renaming places, and people, for that matter is not new. Throughout the Old Testament, God renames places and people. But why? That\u2019s what we wanted to get into on the podcast this week.\nCarmen Joy Imes is associate professor of Old Testament and program coordinator of Bible and theology at Prairie College in Three Hills, Alberta and the of author of Bearing God\u2019s Name: Why Sinai Still Matters and its forthcoming sequel, Being God\u2019s Image: Why Creation Still Matters. She also joined Quick to Listen in 2020. (Listen to \u201cWhen Those in Power Get Sick.\u201d)\nImes joined global media manager Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to discuss Old Testament precedent for renaming people v. places, what it means for humans to have the ability to name, and whether or not churches should bear people\u2019s names.\nWhat is Quick to Listen?

This Monday they opened at $315. For reference, as recently as Jan 12, the stock was $19.95.\nWhy? In recent months, members of the Reddit community, Wall Street Bets, have begun encouraging each other to buy up stock of the company, efforts which began in earnest after several hedge funds announced that they would be betting against the antiquated electronics franchise. One of the first storylines to emerge from this was one that pitted the upstart nerds against the greedy hedge funds. But...like most things, the reality is a bit more complicated\n.Wheaton College assistant professor of economics Enoch Hill joined global media manager Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to break down the craziness on Wall Street and offer some deeper takeaways for those trying to navigate their market and their faith in 2021.\nWhat is Quick to Listen?

All of that changed on January 8, when, in the aftermath of the capitol insurrection, Twitter banned @realDonaldTrump.\n\u201cDue to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President\u2019s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,\u201d read the statement, which included the text of the tweets. \u201cAfter assessing the language in these Tweets against our Glorification of Violence policy, we have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service.\u201d\nTwitter was not the only social media service to crack down on Trump. Snapchat banned him permanently. Facebook banned Trump's account through the remainder of his term and suggested it could ban \"indefinitely.\" Last week, YouTube suspended Trump for a week because they said he violated a violence policy.\nThis flurry of tech moves has raised questions about free speech and left some Christians wondering how well their First Amendment rights will be protected in the midst of this.\nJohn Inazu is a professor of law and religion at the Washington University Law School. He is the author of Confident Pluralism: Surviving and Thriving through Deep Difference and more recently, with Tim Keller, Uncommon Ground: Living Faithfully in a World of Difference.\nInazu joined global media manager Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to discuss the complexity of defining \u201cfree speech,\u201d what people misunderstand about the First Amendment, and the blind spots that Christians can have when advocating for free speech.\nWhat is Quick to Listen?

On Wednesday night, the state executed a 40-year-old man, Brandon Bernard.\nAccording to the AP, \u201cwhen Bernard was 18 he and four other teenagers abducted and robbed Todd and Stacie Bagley on their way from a Sunday service in Killeen, Texas, during which Bernard doused their car with lighter fluid and set it on fire with their bodies in the back trunk.\u201d\nBernard\u2019s death comes several months after the Justice Department surfaced a proposal to \u201creintroduce firing squads and electrocutions for federal executions, giving the government more options for administering capital punishment as drugs used in lethal injections become unavailable.\u201d\nLast Friday, the government executed Alfred Bourgeois, who has an intellectual disability, whose should have meant he could not have been up for the death penalty. But Bourgeois\u2019s trial lawyers did not present evidence of his intellectual disability to the jury. He was the 17th person executed in the united states this year, and the country\u2019s last scheduled execution for 2020.\nThis week on Quick to Listen, we wanted to discuss how to wrestle with the death penalty, accountability, justice, and forgiveness from someone who has straddled many sides of this situation.\u00a0\nJeanne Bishop,\u00a0a felony trial attorney in the Office of the Cook County Public Defender in Chicago. She is the author of Change of Heart: Justice, Mercy, and Making Peace with My Sister\u2019s Killer and\u00a0Grace From the Rubble: Two Fathers\u2019 Road to Reconciliation After the Oklahoma City Bombing. Bishop joined global media manager Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to discuss how her work and sister\u2019s murder have impacted how she views the death penalty, what accountability and justice look like outside of the death penalty, and how to pray for those in the criminal justice system during the pandemic.\u00a0\nWhat is Quick to Listen?\u00a0Read more\nRate Quick to Listen on\u00a0Apple Podcasts\nFollow the podcast on\u00a0Twitter\nFollow our hosts on Twitter:\u00a0Morgan Lee\u00a0and\u00a0Ted Olsen\nFollow our guest on Twitter: Jeanne Bishop\nVisit Jeanne Bishop\u2019s website\nMusic by\u00a0Sweeps\nQuick to Listen is produced by\u00a0Morgan Lee\u00a0and\u00a0Matt Linder\nThe transcript is edited by Yvonne Su\nRead Morgan\u2019s interview with Jeanne:\u00a0Forgiving Her Sister's Murderer, Face to Face\nRead Ted\u2019s piece about Pullman, Disney World, and churches\nLearn more about your ad choices.

A day after the news went public, he posted a picture of his family on Instagram admitting he was unfaithful in his marriage. Both before and after the news, Lentz made headlines across Christian and secular media for his popularity and successful ministry\u2014as well as the \u201chipster\u201d pastor look he popularized.\nWhen Lentz co-founded Hillsong NYC with Joel Houston in 2010, the church drew lines around the block and caught the eye of A-list celebrities, none more famous than Justin Bieber. Lentz, who became famous for his wire-rimmed glasses, plunging V-necks, and designer sneakers, himself became subject of a number of profiles, including this 2015 GQ feature from Taffy Brodesser-Akner:\n\u201cThe music! The lights! The crowds!\u201d begins an incredulous woman narrating a CNN segment on Hillsong NYC . \u201cIt looks like a rock concert.\u201d The chyron reads \u201cHipster preacher smashes stereotypes.\u201d\nThey call Pastor Carl a hipster. Carl says he doesn\u2019t know what that means, and he wears a motorcycle jacket when he says this.Pastor Joel is unwilling to acknowledge that there\u2019s something going on here. Yes, he tells me, sure, he likes clothes. But that\u2019s the end of it. I should ask Pastor Carl about the clothes, he tells me.

Over the last four years, Jackson was a member of President Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board. That consulting team was a marked shift in the role that faith communities had played in the executive branch in recent decades. The focus in the Bush and Obama administrations, by contrast, had been on the ways that faith-based and community groups could work with the federal government on social problems, and on hiring officials who would work on international religious freedom.\nWhat role will religious leaders, religious groups, and religion policy play in a Biden administration? And what lessons might Biden take from his presidential predecessors on how church and state can work together, and how they should work separately?\nThis week on Quick to Listen, we wanted to discuss the future of faith in the Biden administration.\nStanley Carlson-Thies is the founder and senior director of the Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance (IRFA), a division of the Center for Public Justice.

Home of 170,000 people, the majority of its inhabitants are ethnic Armenian and the area itself has been governed by ethnic Armenians since 1994.\nThe countries\u2019 close allegiances with other countries had worried many that the fighting and civilian deaths might spiral into a regional conflict. Armenia, for instance, has close ties to Russia and, to a lesser extent, Iran. Azerbaijan has the strong support of Turkey and some have reported that Syrian militants are also fighting alongside the Azeri.\nAnother complicating level is religion.

After Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg died last month, with less than two months before Election Day, Trump nominated Coney Barrett to replace her on the bench.The proceedings have been contentious. After Antonin Scalia died in 2015, Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold a vote or hold confirmation hearings after President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the seat more than a year before the election. Their decision to move forward with this nomination has provoked charges of hypocrisy.\nIn addition, Coney Barrett\u2019s relationship with her Catholic-Charismatic community, People of Praise, has drawn scrutiny as critics have asked what type of authority this group might have over her judicial decisions.\nGiven Coney Barrett\u2019s rise, this week on\u00a0Quick to Listen, we wanted to talk about the state of Christian legal world with Kim Colby, who has worked for Christian Legal Society\u2019s Center for Law and Religious Freedom since graduating from Harvard Law School in 1981. Colby has represented religious groups in several appellate cases, including two cases heard by the United States Supreme Court. She has filed numerous amicus briefs in federal and state courts. She was also involved in the congressional passage of the Equal Access Act in 1984.\nColby joined global media manager Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to discuss what she makes of Coney Barrett\u2019s participation in her intentional Christian community, what it\u2019s like being a woman in the Christian legal community, and what unites and divides Catholics and Protestants together in this world.\nWhat is Quick to Listen?

They\u2019re going to recommend friends,\u201d said Andringa, who has written several books on board governance, including The Nonprofit Board Answer Book\u00a0and Good Governance for Nonprofits. \u201cAnd so when it comes down to crunch time, those friends have more loyalty to the CEO than they do to the mission of the whole organization.\u201d\nAndringa joined global media manager Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to discuss the blind spots of Christian boards, what encourages and discourages them in holding leaders accountable, and why more retired people should serve on boards.\nTake Quick to Listen\u2019s survey!\nWhat is Quick to Listen?\u00a0Read more\nRate Quick to Listen on\u00a0Apple Podcasts\nFollow the podcast on\u00a0Twitter\nFollow our hosts on Twitter:\u00a0Morgan Lee\u00a0and\u00a0Ted Olsen\nMusic by\u00a0Sweeps\nQuick to Listen is produced by\u00a0Morgan Lee\u00a0and\u00a0Matt Linder\nThe transcript is edited by\u00a0Bunmi Ishola\nLearn more about your ad choices.

People just are not prepared to tolerate the restrictions that are actually impinging upon their consciences essentially.\u201d\nFagan joined global media manager Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to discuss the arrival of Protestant Christianity in Belarus, what religious freedom looks like in the former Soviet country, and what the global church can learn from Belarusian Christians.\u00a0\nTake Quick to Listen\u2019s survey!\nWhat is Quick to Listen?\u00a0Read more\nRate Quick to Listen on\u00a0Apple Podcasts\nFollow the podcast on\u00a0Twitter\nFollow our hosts on Twitter:\u00a0Morgan Lee\u00a0and\u00a0Ted Olsen\nMusic by\u00a0Sweeps\nQuick to Listen is produced by\u00a0Morgan Lee\u00a0and\u00a0Matt Linder\nThe transcript is edited by\u00a0Bunmi Ishola\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Here\u2019s how CT captured the situation in a recent report:\nLike most businesses and ministries across the country, Christian camps felt the economic halt right away. Church retreats and events were called off in March, April, and May due to bans on mass gatherings across the states. Before long, camps were forced to grapple with the unimaginable: no summer camp.By May\u2019s end, more than 100 Christian camps had announced cancellations. Most of the rest made dramatic changes to summer programming.

But six weeks later, a dominant theme is the removal of monuments, and memorials. Protesters have torn down or vandalized dozens of statues connected to the Confederacy and to other controversial historical figures like Christopher Columbus.\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time that statues have been torn down en mass amid widespread protests. After Constantine allowed Christianity in the Roman Empire, Christians tore down so many statues that in Athens they reportedly became known as \u201cthe people who move that which should not be moved.\u201d Early church battled each other over religious iconography. Reformation Christians inspired another round of eager statue smashing and removal.\n\u201cWhat's funny is when I was first getting acclimated to art as a Protestant, and learning that art history mattered, we were embarrassed about our iconoclastic heritage,\u201d said Matthew Milliner, associate professor of art history at Wheaton College. \u201cBut what an honor to be known as \u2018the people who moved that which should not be moved.\u2019\u201d\nMilliner joined global media manager Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to discuss how much\u00a0earlier Christian battles over statues echo today\u2019s fights, what\u00a0Christians have learned that might help us better understand the call to remove statues today, and whether we should even be creating memorials and monuments in the first place.\u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

A test of who we trust and how we think about what's worth trusting and understanding.\u201d\nJohnson joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to share about how the Bible discusses conspiracy theories, what Paul means when he writes about the mysteries of God,\u00a0and what differentiates a conspiracy theory from a religion.\u00a0\nWhat is Quick to Listen?\u00a0Read more\nRate Quick to Listen on\u00a0Apple Podcasts\nFollow the podcast on\u00a0Twitter\nFollow our hosts on Twitter:\u00a0Morgan Lee\u00a0and\u00a0Ted Olsen\nFollow our guest on Twitter:\u00a0Dru Johnson\nVisit our guest\u2019s website: Dru Johnson\nMusic by\u00a0Sweeps\nQuick to Listen is produced by\u00a0Morgan Lee\u00a0and\u00a0Matt Linder\nThe transcript is edited by\u00a0Bunmi Ishola\nLearn more about your ad choices.

And even for churches who might have access to a tripod, smartphone, microphone and Facebook Live--their members might not have bandwidth fast enough for live video or they themselves might not be comfortable accessing these new platforms.\u00a0\nJonathan Brooks, the senior pastor at Canaan Community Church in Chicago\u2019s West Englewood neighborhood, says that he has some fellow pastor friends whose churches are still meeting, in spite of the state\u2019s coronavirus meeting bans.\n\"But it's because of the giving. It's because if they don't physically have church, they won't get any money and their budget is not so that they can miss a Sunday,\u201d said Brooks. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s such a conundrum, it\u2019s such a quandary.

It\u2019s also, of course, a time to reflect on the state of race relations within the church.\nOne of those efforts has been the OneRace Movement, a group that has brought more than 500 Atlanta-area pastors of all ethnic and racial backgrounds together in the name of reconciliation and revival. In 2018, the movement hosted a worship service at Stone Mountain, the largest tourist attraction in the state of Georgia\u2014and also where confederate heroes Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Stonewall Jackson are etched in granite.\nWhy host an event meant to promote strengthening race relations at such a polemic site?\n\u201cIt's a place with a dark history, but also present cultural significance,\u201d said Hazen Stephens, the co-director of OneRace. \u201c...Biblically, whenever reformers would come in, the first thing that they would do is they would go to the high place and they would remove the Asherah poles and they would take down the idols. And we felt like what we were doing at Stone Mountain as we were calling church leaders to go to a place where spiritually an idol was erected over a 100 years ago, and to tear down that idol and say, this is not what our city stands for anymore.\u201d\nLearning this type of history is part of OneRace\u2019s model: Know the story. Own the story. Change the story. This knowledge is crucial for white Christians trying to gain credibility from Christians of color\u00a0when they enter into these conversations, says\u00a0co-director Josh Clemons.\n\u201cIf I were going to say something to the white church, I would say get invested in the story. It's time to listen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's time to hear from African American brothers and sisters. It's time to hear from Hispanic brothers and sisters. It's time to hear from Asian brothers and sisters. And how the story of race and the effects of race has impacted them. And, and then secondly, to be invested in that history so that we can own and ultimately change the story for generations to come.\u201d\nStephens and fellow co-director Josh Clemons joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and CEO and president Tim Dalrymple to discuss the name of the initiative, how they\u2019ve tried to make their day on\u00a0Stone Mountain more than a \u201cmountaintop experience,\u201d and how the\u00a0movement has also encouraged Christians from different denominations to partner together.\u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "Transcribed highlights of the show can be found in our episode summaries.\nLast week, a California couple\u2019s two-year-old daughter stopped breathing and died. In the wake of the tragedy, the parents, Andrew and Kalley Heiligenthal, had an unusual response:\u00a0\n\"We are asking for bold, unified prayers from the global church to stand with us in belief that He will raise this little girl back to life. Her time here is not done, and it is our time to believe boldly, and with confidence wield what King Jesus paid for. It\u2019s time for her to come to life,\u201d Kalley, a worship leader and songwriter at Bethel Church, wrote on Instagram, where she has more than 250 thousand followers. In response to her words, hundreds of people posted under the hashtag, #wakeupolive.\nReaction to the Heiligenthal\u2019s actions has been polarized. But according to apologist Lee Strobel, the family\u2019s belief in miracles is similiar to that of many others. In a Barna study about prayer and healing that he commissioned for his recent The Case for Miracles,\u00a0Strobel asked a sample of American adults if there was anything in their life they could only explain as being a miracle.\n\u201cThirty-eight percent of American adults said yes,\u201d said Strobel. \u201cNow if you extrapolate that number that would mean that there would be 94 million miracles just in the United States!\u201d\nStrobel joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss what is unique or interesting about Jesus\u2019s miracles, how the Protestant Reformation changed Christians\u2019 understanding of miracles, and whether or not Christians should pray for their loved ones to come back to life.\u00a0\nWhat is\u00a0Quick to Listen?\u00a0Read more\nSubscribe to\u00a0Quick to Listen\u00a0on\u00a0Apple Podcasts\nFollow the podcast on\u00a0Twitter\nFollow our host on Twitter:\u00a0Morgan Lee\nSubscribe to Mark\u2019s newsletter:\u00a0The Galli Report\nLearn more about\u00a0Stan Jones\u2019s books\nMusic by\u00a0Sweeps\nQuick to Listen\u00a0is produced by\u00a0Morgan Lee\u00a0and\u00a0Matt Linder\nThe transcript is edited by\u00a0Bunmi Ishola\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Among the issues the synod is investigating: how church leaders should respond to chronic priest shortages, the role of women in official church leadership, and environmental degradation.\nUnder the previous popes, John Paul II and Benedict the XVI, synods\u2014or meetings convening all of the top brass of the Catholic church\u2014were largely symbolic, says Christopher White, the national correspondent for the Catholic publication Crux. Not so with Pope Francis.\n\u201cHis two synods on the family wrestled with, among other issues, communion. And in the end, after two synods and two years of deliberation, Pope Francis issued a document that allowed for a cautious opening to communion for divorced and remarried Catholics, which did move forward the Church's pastoral teaching on that particular issue,\u201d said White.\nWhite suggested that the Amazon synod may conclude similarly.\n\u201cAmong the many issues that they're going to be discussing in Rome over the next three weeks is perhaps relaxing the celibacy requirement for priests because there is such a shortage of priests in the particular region of the Amazon. And they're grappling with what to do about it,\u201d he said.\nWhite joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss the real or symbolic importance of synods, what makes the Amazon region particularly vexing to the Church, and why Protestants should stay abreast of an important Catholic meeting.\nToday's episode of Quick to Listen is brought to you in part by Baylor University\u2019s Truett Seminary, where Kingdom-minded women and men are equipped to follow their callings.

If Dunahoo would have been elected, she would have been the first female president since the denomination\u2019s founder, Aimee Semple McPherson.\nThough women have largely been absent from denominational leadership structures, that women have been allowed to preach from the beginning of the movement makes them unique among Protestant traditions.Historically, Pentecostals \u201cdidn\u2019t prefer the traditional method of leadership identification,\u201d said Leah Payne, the author of Gender and Pentecostal Revivalism: Making a Female Ministry in the Early Twentieth Century. \u201cThey did, in fact, reject things like seminary.\u201d\nPeople preferred calling because it existed outside of these types of structures and institutions.\u201cPlus you could be five years old and receive a calling,\u201d said Payne.\nPayne joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss why women have struggled to advance past the pastorate, the unique ways Pentecostals understand church leadership, and why many Pentecostal churches have pastor couples that lead churches together.\nWhat is \u201c Quick to Listen\u201d?

                "summary": "Last week, three more high-profile mass shootings rocked the US, once again sparking intense debate about gun control, white supremacy, and the president\u2019s role in inspiring the shootings. In the wake of these attacks, the media also profiled the alleged gunmen, who were dubbed \u201cloners\u201d by those who knew them. They were also all young\u2014the three alleged gunmen\u2019s ages fell between 19 and 24. An LA Times\u00a0op-ed by researchers who have analyzed data about the profile of mass shooters since 1966 also noted that nearly all of them were traumatized as children. \nThe American church\u2019s youth ministry model hasn\u2019t done a good job of reaching this demographic, largely because of the middle-class\u2019s desire for safety, said Andrew Root, the author of multiple books on youth ministry and a professor of youth and family ministry at Lutheran Seminary.\u201cSo all of a sudden, a loner kid comes, who either is bullying or has been bullied, and then comes in and is just a negative presence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can lead young people to say they don't feel safe and lead parents to be very clear to the youth worker that they don't want that kid around because he/she feels unsafe. I think it becomes really difficult that American youth ministry as it classically has been a middle-class phenomenon and that tends to push these young people out. Or not even out, but they just disappear.\u201d\nRoot joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to discuss the complexities of welcoming disaffected young people into church, why lack of interpersonal relationships especially hurts young people, and what Bonhoeffer has to offer our current conversation on youth ministry.\nNote: the date that marked the beginning of the data set in the research published by the LA Times was incorrectly stated on the podcast. It is correct in the show notes and here: 1966.\nThis episode of Quick to Listen is brought to you in part by Things Above Podcast: Heavenly Thinking for Earthly Engagement. \nThis episode of Quick to Listen is also brought to you by Focus on the Family\u2019s Bring Your Bible to School Day powered by students nationwide October 3rd.

Our focus here at the State Department has been to do our level best to do what we believe these people actually want: to help them stay inside of their own country, to deliver them goods and services and benefits, and to help shape their government policies in ways that permit them not to have to flee the country but allow them to exist safely and securely inside of their own country. Now on staff at World Relief Dupage/Aurora, Durmomo Gary came to the United States over a decade ago. He left Sudan in the early 2000s after an attempt on his life because of his Christian faith and recently wrote about his experiences for the Daily Herald. \"We landed in New York on October 31. As an American you know what day that is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe landed in the airport and all I can see around is creepy costumes. Never read about it. Never heard about it. It freaked me out.\u201d Gary and his wife survived the bizarre cultural experience to make their transfer to Chicago and begin the US side of the refugee resettlement process. Gary joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss what happens when you find out someone\u2019s trying to kill you, how to get a passport when people are trying to kill you, and what it\u2019s like to be a Christian in Sudan v.

                "summary": "How God is working through the Windrush generation and beyond. The number of churches continues to drop in the UK. As CT reported last month, there are only 39,000 congregations left in the country, a quarter drop from 20 years ago. But despite churches increasingly closing their doors and the number of people attending church falling, this bad news isn\u2019t across the board. For Black Majority Churches, the numbers actually look a lot healthier. These congregations began in the wake of World War II, when immigrants began arriving in the UK from the Caribbean, sparking a generation that became known as the Windrush generation, named after the boat that the inaugural group took. \u201cThey came over to help the UK,\u201d said Chine McDonald, the media, content, and PR lead at Christian Aid. McDonald\u2019s family came over from Nigeria several decades later, though they didn\u2019t always face a warm welcome from the local congregations. \u201cI remember when we would go to predominantly white churches. We would arrive on a Sunday and were told, \u2018What made you choose this church as opposed to a black church that was down the road?\u2019\u201d said McDonald. \u201c...These white majority churches weren\u2019t used to see black people in their congregations, weren\u2019t used to having black friends or black neighbors.\u201d Nigeria is actually responsible for one of the country\u2019s most robust denominations, the Redeemed Christian Church of God, which has more than 800 churches in the UK. McDonald joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss the growth of African and West Indian Christianity and how it is changing the UK.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "Nearly 300 people are dead after suicide bombers attacked three churches and three high-end hotels on Easter Sunday this week. Christians\u2014the majority of whom are Catholics\u2014make up less than 10 percent of the population of the majority-Buddhist nation, and have reported escalating concerns about their religious freedom. Christian persecution has largely come at the hands of Buddhist radicals, so the church has largely responded to the attacks with shock, says Ivor Poobalan, the Prinicipal of Colombo Theological seminary in Kohuwala (Colombo), Sri Lanka. \u201cWe expected the threat or danger to come from those quarters,\u201d said Poobalan. \u201cIslam has been around for over 1,000 years and has never been violent.\u201d Poobalan joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and theology editor Caleb Lindgren to discuss how Christianity arrived in Sri Lanka, why the faith has long been associated with privilege, and how he hopes the church will respond to the bombings.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

When they\u2019re kept from inmates in their final moments, it can mean there\u2019s no one who is able to relay the individual\u2019s last words. \u201cThat inmate was looking for a way to say \u2018bye\u2019 in peace and because you said \u2018No, you can\u2019t have [the chaplain],\u2019 even in his death, there was no peace,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe often say that when they\u2019re executed there\u2019s going to be closure. Executions don\u2019t bring closure. They just mean someone has died.\u201d Smith joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and theology editor Caleb Lindgren to discuss why Christians should want all death row inmates to be able to be with their chosen chaplain when they die, what it\u2019s like to spiritually walk with prisoners, and the surprising circumstances that led to Smith winding up at San Quentin.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

A lot of readers wrote in to express appreciation for covering a topic that really matters to so many, but we also got a fair number of responses that were concerned that our take on retirement was too narrow. One reader, Rodney, summed it up this way: \"Your article 'Saving Retirement' in the March issue was a good summary of the situation facing retirees today.

Scroll to the bottom of the episode description to read through our conversation with David Bailey.\u00a0Last week, the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News published a three-part investigation into the scope of sex abuse in the Southern Baptist Convention. Among one of the seeming fruits of their report was an announcement from the head of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Al Mohler wanted to apologize for the role that he played in protecting his friend CJ Mahaney after he was accused of covering up a sex abuse scandal at his church. In an 850-word statement, Mohler acknowledged his role in supporting Mahaney, even as questions arose about his involvement. He then expressed regret for his former actions and spoke specifically about where he believed he had fallen short. \u201cI can only speak for myself, but I wish to do so clearly, acknowledging these errors, grieving at the harm that was done, and committing to do everything I can to lead well and to serve Christ faithfully.\u201d Like many public apologies today, Mohler\u2019s drew a mixed reaction. Some were frustrated about the length of time it took for him to acknowledge his mistakes. Others were encouraged by the change of heart from a man who it had seemed might never change his mind. \u201cWith our leaders, any kind of leadership, people want to know, if something\u2019s wrong, do you see it and are you going to do something about it? Are you going to do the right thing?\u201d said David Bailey, the executive director of Arrabaon, a ministry that helps Christian leaders engage in in reconciliation. \u201cLeadership, a lot of times, is moving on the currency of trust. I think a demand for an apology is \u2018Hey, can I trust you? Are you going to do the right thing?\u2019\u201d Bailey joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss why it\u2019s hard to offer a good public apology, why it\u2019s significant that we \u201cdemand an apology,\u201d and how long is long enough before the start of a \u201ccomeback\u201d story.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

These funds will boost projects in Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, Moldova, Egypt, Ghana, South Africa, Tanzania, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan, and Russia. No sign language has a full Bible translation, and just 2 percent of deaf people around the world have access to the Gospels in their sign languages. According to CT\u2019s reporting: Sign languages aren\u2019t structured like text-based or spoken languages [and] they require their own processes for passages of Scripture to be told visually through sign. Chronological Bible Translation (CBT) translates the Bible by stories, while Book-by-Book (BBB) translation uses the chapter and verse structure, the Deaf Bible Society explained. The deaf community is made up of visual learners, says Jason Suhr, the director of Scripture Engagement & Translation at the Deaf Bible Society. \u201cWe don\u2019t rely on specific words,\u201d said Suhr, through translator William Ross III. \u201cWe kind of rely more on images and the context of those images.\u201d When someone is signing, they will first set the scene, often spelling out the weather and where objects, plants, trees, or people might be. \u201cYou don\u2019t really get a lot of that in English,\u201d said Suhr. \u201cYou have to create that image in your head, whereas deaf people are able to set that up.\u201d Suhr joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to to explore why it\u2019s taken such a long time to provide this community with a translation of the Bible and what it will take to transform this situation.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Against such things there is no law.\u201d Wood joined digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss the biblical basis for a virtuous life, if Aristotle\u2019s exhortations ever clash with those of the Bible, and what it looks like to actually become a person of character.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "It\u2019s been a bloody year in the Central African Republic. Two months ago, a massacre claimed the lives of dozens of people in the country after suspected Islamist rebels attacked a group of civilians. The massacre was just the latest in a wave of violence for the country of 4.5 million. At the beginning of this year, the CAR\u2019s capital had been considered a safe haven in the war-torn country. It was the only place the government claimed control, as three-quarters of the landlocked nation is occupied by armed groups. But since the spring, the country has witnessed an upsurge of violence, notably with attacks targeting churches and church leaders in the capital city, Bangui, and Bambari, another important city in the country. Four Catholic priests were targeted, with three of them killed in separate Islamist attacks. In response to the violence from the past couple years, a militia composed primarily of Christians has also committed atrocities against Muslims. But the unrest hasn\u2019t divided the church, says Paul Mpindi, the director of Mission French Africa; a radio ministry that focuses on evangelism, discipleship, and stewardship in French-speaking Africa. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful for the Catholic Church and Protestant church because they are working together,\u201d said Mpindi. \u201cThe bishop there has been at the forefront of the peace transition, helping the government, helping the rebels, and working with the Muslims.\u201d Mpindi joined associate digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli on Quick to Listen to discuss why violence is once again on the upswing, who really makes up the country\u2019s \u201cChristian militia,\u201d and what it will take for peace to prevail in the country.

In many cases, no, says\u00a0Ken Sande, the founder of Peacemaker Ministries and the current president of Relational Wisdom 360. \u201cTypically, conflict between Christians involves some foundation of sin,\u201d said Sande.\u00a0\u201cLawyers can dress that up in legal terms, but what it really comes down to in 99 percent of the cases is sin. Keeping one\u2019s word. Slandering. False representation. Bitterness. Anger. Unforgiveness. Those are all spiritual issues that the church has jurisdiction over and a judge can\u2019t touch.\u201d Sande joined associate digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss conflict resolution\u2014or lack thereof\u2014when it comes to Christians, the power of seeing people confess sin to one another, and how these processes play out in a #MeToo era.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "Last week, the world\u2019s leading climate scientists released a sobering report, which claimed that there are only a dozen years to keep the Earth\u2019s climate from increasing by 1.5 degrees Celsius. If the planet fails to do so, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned, the risk of drought, floods, extreme heat, and poverty for hundreds of millions of people will massively increase. To avoid barreling toward this future, the entire world will have to make massive changes in the way it currently consumes energy. \u201cIt\u2019s a line in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment and we must act now,\u201d Debra Roberts, a scientist who worked on the report, told The Guardian. \u201cThis is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilizes people and dents the mood of complacency.\u201d But upending the status quo is incredibly difficult work, says Peter Harris, cofounder of A Rocha, an international Christian nature organization. A former parish minister, Harris says he sees parallels between his conservation work and his life in church ministry. \u201cI had to sit next to the bedside of a dying friend. It was good to be there. It was good for us to share the presence of God and the hope of the resurrection,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes we know when we\u2019re potentially going to lose the conservation battle\u2014and honestly I doubt if we will keep the temperature rise below two degrees within the next 15 years\u2014what we have to do it out of is that the Lord will not abandon his creation. He\u2019ll stir up his church worldwide.\u201d Harris joined associate digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss UN report\u2019s warnings and predictions, the human impact of climate change, and why a Christian response to this report must be rooted in a bigger vision than halting climate change.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Shortly after the hearing, a book excerpt from Tim Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church, appeared in The New York Times. \u201cChristians cannot pretend they can transcend politics and simply \u2018preach the Gospel,\u2019\u201d he wrote in his latest book Prodigal Prophet: Jonah and the Mystery of God\u2019s Mercy. \u201cThose who avoid all political discussions and engagement are essentially casting a vote for the social status quo. \u2026 To not be political is to be political.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean that Christians have to hold convictions about every moment of political life, said Keller. One example: knowing exactly who or what to believe about Kavanaugh and Ford: \u201cNeither you nor I are decision makers at all. We\u2019re not being asked to make a decision. If I was in a position where I had to make a decision\u2014I had a vote or I had to do something about it\u2014then I would be doing everything I could to get to the bottom of things,\u201d Keller told CT. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why everyone on Twitter feels like they have to come to a position. That\u2019s actually kind of new.\u201d Keller joined associate digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss how he follows this news, where his political convictions come from, and just how great the stakes are of politics.\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.

Since the website first went up, many in the evangelical Twitter world and blogosphere have debated the merits of the conference and of the \u201cspiritual friendship\u201d movement in which the conference is grounded. Some are concerned that \u201csupporting and encouraging\u201d Christians of these \u201csexual minorities\u201d (as the website names them) is a slippery slope ending in a liberal, relativistic Christianity that has lost its ethical moorings. Others believe that if one observes \u201cthe historic, Christian doctrine of marriage,\u201d Christians of any orientation should be able to gather together and talk about their concerns\u2014and thus be supported and encouraged by one another. At stake in these conversations: the debate over whether same-sex attraction in itself is a sin\u2014or if only the acting on that attraction is the sin. \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard sermons that say, \u2018If you\u2019re being tempted, that\u2019s not sin. It\u2019s only sin if you give into the temptation,\u2019\u201d said Phillip Cary, a professor of philosophy at Eastern University. \u201cLet\u2019s call this the soft line on temptation.\u201d But it turns out that this view isn\u2019t necessarily one that\u2019s been taught by the Protestant greats. \u201cLuther and Calvin and their friends took a hard line on this. They said that the desire that makes up our temptation is already sin, even before we give in or consent to this,\u201d Cary said. And turns out Augustine had his own ideas on the topic. Cary joined associate digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss how the Bible defines temptation, why it\u2019s hard for Christians to disentangle sin and temptation, and what it means when some of the pillars of faith reached radically different conclusions.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "In 2011, The New York Times profiled several church plants in New York City trying to make it in Manhattan: \"In recent decades the number of English-speaking evangelical churches south of Harlem has grown tenfold, to more than 100, said Tony Carnes, a researcher ... who has studied New York churches since the 1970s. Without fanfare, the newcomers have created networks to pay for new churches and to form church-planting incubators, treating the city as a mission field.\" That was seven years ago. More recently, these church plants are moving into Harlem and into boroughs and neighborhoods less financially well off as center-city Manhattan. These characteristics of New York church planting are part of a larger tension across the country, as dozens of churches increasingly open up in some of the urban area\u2019s most disinvested communities. As they launch, the neighborhoods they inhabit often begin to change\u2014begging the question: Are these churches drivers of changes in the community or merely swept up into economic and social forces outside of their control? Jos\u00e9 Humphreys is a pastor and was part of a team that founded a church in one of these neighborhoods. \u201cChurch plants need to be more is a little more mindful, discerning and self-critical. Look at the different ways they show up. What does your incarnational presence communicate to the community around you? \u201cWhat do you bring in your embodied presence, in your body, skin, class, your education?\u201d said Humphreys, the author of the forthcoming \"Seeing Jesus in East Harlem: What Happens When Churches Show Up and Stay Put.\" \u201cMy wife and I realize that just because her last name is Lopez and my first name is Jos\u00e9 doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we automatically identify with people in East Harlem.\u201d Humphreys joined associate digital media producer Morgan Lee and associate theology editor Caleb Lindgren to discuss the catalysts behind church plants entering under-resourced neighborhoods, what separates church plants from the storefront churches, and if people should move into the neighborhoods in which they worship.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Some of these terms are strange and unfamiliar, but for many thinkers today, they provide a helpful way to understand the seismic cultural shifts we've seen happen in the last couple of generations. From Tim Keller to Russell Moore to Rod Dreher, a lot of Christian thought leaders and quite a few academics are using these ideas to help understand our modern world and it is all based on the work of a guy named Charles Taylor.

Colin Hanson, executive editor of The Gospel Coalition, thinks it has to do with the way that Taylor helps unpack and clarify the cultural changes we're all experiencing but find hard to describe. \"A lot of what Taylor does is he'll take something that is rather obvious, but that nobody has named before or that nobody has described,\" Hanson explains. \"It's almost like somebody who gives you language to describe the air that you breathe.

Since this podcast was recorded, Baptist Press reported that a senior professor of evangelism and student ministry at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary had resigned over \u201cpersonal and spiritual issues.\u201d The same article also reported that an Alabama pastor had resigned as executive director of Connect316 and publisher of SBC Today\u00a0over a Facebook post that seemed to make light of gang rape at the expense of a number of prominent Southern Baptist leaders. This news came just hours after Southern Baptist Theological Seminary president Al Mohler published a piece he headlined \u201cThe Wrath of God Poured Out: The Humiliation of the Southern Baptist Convention.\u201d And just hours before, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary trustees removed Paige Patterson as president. That\u2019s just from this week. We could go back further. So what\u2019s going on? We asked longtime Southern Baptist leader Ed Stetzer, now executive director of Wheaton College\u2019s Billy Graham Center, to shed light on everything happening to America\u2019s largest Protestant denomination. Stetzer joined associate digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss whether or not the denomination is truly in a #MeToo moment (like Mohler has claimed), why Southern Baptist leaders generally don\u2019t publicly criticize each other, and what role the internet and social media have played in the events of the past month.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Here\u2019s what the now-president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary said: It depends on the level of abuse to some degree. I have never in my ministry counseled that anybody seek a divorce, and I do think that\u2019s always wrong counsel. There have been, however, an occasion or two when the level of the abuse was serious enough, dangerous enough, immoral enough that I have counseled temporary separation and the seeking of help. I would urge you to understand that that should happen only in the most serious of cases. . . . More often, when you face abuse, it is of a less serious variety. These comments recirculated on social media over the weekend, not surprisingly sparking fierce criticism of Patterson\u2019s remarks. On Sunday, Patterson released a statement where he clarified that his happiness in the situation came from seeing this woman\u2019s husband return to church. He also said that physical or sexual abuse should be reported to the appropriate authorities, \u201cas I have always done.\u201d Patterson also stated that, \u201cI have also said that I have never recommended or prescribed divorce. How could I as a minister of the Gospel? The Bible makes clear the way in which God views divorce.\u201d Patterson\u2019s statement seemed to suggest that abuse was not included as one of the ways in which divorce is biblically sanctioned. But that understanding isn\u2019t really a biblical one, says Justin Holcomb, an ordained minister and the co-author of Is It My Fault?: Hope and Healing for Those Suffering Domestic Violence. \u201cSometimes people like to out-conservative the Bible. \u2026 I appreciate the desire stay to close to the authority of Scripture,\u201d Holcomb said. But some Christians may be wary about sanctioning divorce after abuse because it\u2019s not explicitly mentioned as a cause to end a marriage, despite the fact that the Bible speaks frankly about violence and abuse, he says. \u201cIn Psalm 11:5, the psalmist, referring to God, says \u2018I hate the one who does violence and abuses,\u2019\u201d said Holcomb. \u201cSome people want to quote Malachi 2, \u2018I hate divorce.\u2019 If that\u2019s how that\u2019s interpreted\u2014which I\u2019ve already put a question mark to\u2014well you can find a whole bunch more passages that say that God hates the violent\u00a0and the oppressor. Holcomb joined associate digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to explain how he interprets Malachi 2, if there is a theology or faith practice that correlates with spouse abuse, and if there\u2019s a real tension between pursuing a biblical marriage and taking a hard line on domestic violence.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

There have been, however, an occasion or two when the level of the abuse was serious enough, dangerous enough, immoral enough that I have counseled temporary separation and the seeking of help. I would urge you to understand that that should happen only in the most serious of cases. . . . More often, when you face abuse, it is of a less serious variety. These comments recirculated on social media over the weekend, not surprisingly sparking fierce criticism of Patterson\u2019s remarks. On Sunday, Patterson released a statement where he clarified that his happiness in the situation came from seeing this woman\u2019s husband return to church. He also said that physical or sexual abuse should be reported to the appropriate authorities, \u201cas I have always done.\u201d Patterson also stated that, \u201cI have also said that I have never recommended or prescribed divorce. How could I as a minister of the Gospel? The Bible makes clear the way in which God views divorce.\u201d Patterson\u2019s statement seemed to suggest that abuse was not included as one of the ways in which divorce is biblically sanctioned. But that understanding isn\u2019t really a biblical one, says Justin Holcomb, an ordained minister and the co-author of Is It My Fault?: Hope and Healing for Those Suffering Domestic Violence. \u201cSometimes people like to out-conservative the Bible. \u2026 I appreciate the desire stay to close to the authority of Scripture,\u201d Holcomb said. But some Christians may be wary about sanctioning divorce after abuse because it\u2019s not explicitly mentioned as a cause to end a marriage, despite the fact that the Bible speaks frankly about violence and abuse, he says. \u201cIn Psalm 11:5, the psalmist, referring to God, says \u2018I hate the one who does violence and abuses,\u2019\u201d said Holcomb. \u201cSome people want to quote Malachi 2, \u2018I hate divorce.\u2019 If that\u2019s how that\u2019s interpreted\u2014which I\u2019ve already put a question mark to\u2014well you can find a whole bunch more passages that say that God hates the violent\u00a0and the oppressor. Holcomb joined associate digital media producer Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to explain how he interprets Malachi 2, if there is a theology or faith practice that correlates with spouse abuse, and if there\u2019s a real tension between pursuing a biblical marriage and taking a hard line on domestic violence.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Instead, most catalogs sent by groups like World Vision, Heifer International, and Compassion International boast items like livestock and other agricultural products that they\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll buy for those in need overseas.

Regardless of a workplace\u2019s affiliation to faith, speaking out about colleagues\u2019 bad behavior is challenging for most people, says Halee Gray Scott, the director of Denver Seminary\u2019s Kaleo Project, who is currently writing a book exploring how men and women can work well collectively in ministry. The obstacles just manifest themselves in different ways. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in Christian organizations for 20 years and there is a tendency to think that everyone\u2019s doing everything right,\u201d said Gray Scott. \u201c[Everyone believes that] everyone\u2019s trying to do the godly thing. \u2026 You end up having that discretion moment where you ask, \u2018Is something going wrong? I\u2019m not sure that it is. It can\u2019t possibly be.\u2019\u201d On the other hand, there may be a broader acceptance of questionable behavior at a non-religious company, she says. \u201cIn secular organizations, there is a tendency to accept a certain level of sexual impropriety as flirting or goofing off or someone having a good time,\u201d said Gray Scott. Gray Scott joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss the difference between enabling and showing discretion, why culture cares more about sexual harassment than in decades past, and how the Billy Graham rule fits into this discussion.\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "Earlier this week, accusations that five Wheaton College football players had brutally hazed their teammate made national headlines. This news marked the biggest football scandal at a Christian school since five Baylor University players received charges of rape and assault. (The incident also led to the removal of Baylor president Ken Starr and head coach Art Briles and the resignation of athletic director Ian McCaw.) While details of the Wheaton case continue to emerge, football\u2019s unique impact on Christian college campuses can\u2019t be denied, said Dan Wood, the executive director of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). \u201cFootball leads. If it\u2019s a Christian college, I will tell you it\u2019s the primary sport,\u201d he said. Football is the most physical sport most colleges offer and its position as a fall sport means that athletes often return earlier than other students, a period that reaffirms their status as the center of the campus life, he said. \u201cFootball brings a different culture,\u201d said Wood, who cautions Christian colleges before they add football programs. \u201cWe are putting [athletes] on pedestals,\u201d Wood said. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s our fault. Sometimes that\u2019s their fault. But nonetheless, that\u2019s where we find them way too often on the Christian campus.\u201d Wood joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss whether Christian schools have different student-athlete environments than their secular counterparts, the purpose of the NCCAA, and if sports build character\u2014or only reveal it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

From CT\u2019s report: Three Texas churches impacted by Hurricane Harvey sued FEMA this week for deeming them ineligible for disaster relief grants. The agency\u2019s policy excludes sanctuaries that serve as shelters after natural disasters. Conflicts between FEMA and houses of worship aren\u2019t new. In 1995, there was a debate over whether churches could use federal aid to repair damage from the Oklahoma City bombing. (Congress passed a law saying yes, they can.) In 2002, the Justice Department said Seattle churches were eligible for earthquake aid. In 2013, the House voted overwhelmingly to say churches can get FEMA funds for Hurricane Sandy but the bill ultimately died in the Senate. Part of the reason why there\u2019s been no federal statute solution is that there isn\u2019t always political urgency around the issue, said Chelsea Langston Bombino, the director of strategic engagement for the Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance at the Center for Public Justice. \u201cI would love to see the broader nonprofit community say, \u2018We don\u2019t all have to agree on our mission.

Back in 2001, one author wrote for CT, \u201cJoshua Harris hasn't made my life any easier. In fact, thanks to him, my future wife\u2014wherever she is\u2014 may very well have given up the idea of ever dating.\u201d This author wasn\u2019t the only one questioning the book\u2019s advice on dating, sex, and love\u2014over the next two decades, a number of people influenced by the book began to push back. Today, Harris is a former megachurch pastor enrolled in seminary and is currently reconsidering some of the book\u2019s arguments and perspectives. Harris has begun engaging his critics and is trying to raise money to film a documentary about the book\u2019s negative feedback. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to move on from this book for some time, but I\u2019m trying to talk to people who are sharing stories with me about ways the book really hurt them and damaged them. It\u2019s partly for my own sense of closure to come back and reevaluate it and even to admit ways that I have now changed in my thinking,\u201d Harris said. Harris joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editorial director Ted Olsen to discuss the consequences of ideas, the arguments in I Kissed Dating Goodbye that he still finds appealing, and whether he\u2019d recommend the book today.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

From CT\u2019s report: \"More than 100 Iraqi Christians arrested in immigration raids earlier this month will get to stay in the United States\u2014at least for another two weeks, according to an order issued yesterday by a federal judge in Detroit.\" Of the more than 1,000 Iraqis who live in America, 300 of them were Christians slated to be deported later this summer, a move which provoked significant outcry from the community. \u201cThis is about the conditions we are sending people back to. We are imposing a death penalty through the back door,\u201d said the lawyer of one of those affected. This news came just weeks after Vice President Mike Pence attended an event highlighting the plight of persecuted Christians. Pence also hosted the top leaders from churches in Iraq and Syria. \u201cMike Pence been really outspoken in support of our community. We couldn\u2019t really ask anything better from the vice president,\u201d said Martin Manna, the president of the Chaldean Chamber and Foundation in Detroit, Michigan. Finding a political home has been challenging for the Iraqi Christian American diaspora, said Manna. The community was frustrated at George W. Bush for invading Iraq but also blamed Barack Obama for not responding urgently enough to ISIS, which has terrorized Christians in their homeland. While President Trump promised to protect them, his administration has moved to deport Iraqi Christians in America. \u201cIt\u2019s a very conservative community. It\u2019s always faith first and family,\u201d said Manna. \u201c\u2026 Republicans\u2014while they appreciate our Christian beliefs and they fight for us when we talk about the persecution of Christians\u2014when you talk about immigration they seem to shut down. On the other side, when you talk to Democrats, they want to rally around social justice and immigration reform but when we talk about the persecution of Christians, it goes to a deaf ear.\u201d Manna recently joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss why Iraqi Christians originally immigrated to America, why longtime members of the community are at risk of deportation, and what their relationship with Arab Muslims looks like in their new country. Listeners may also want to check out Quick to Listen, Episode 27, which discussed why so few Syrian refugees have been Christians.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "Here\u2019s how Quick to Listen producer Richard Clark introduced this podcast last year: I\u2019ve been fascinated by the potential of podcasts because I see them as an opportunity for listeners to opt-in to become part of a captive, actively listening audience. Podcasts provide us with opportunities for active listening, a chance to hear multiple perspectives on a subject without the temptation to click away or draw conclusions too soon. \u2026 Quick to Listen is about giving ourselves the opportunity to hear, really hear, one another. Our hope is, at the end of each episode, we might be one step closer to the truth of these complex situations. So taking in arguments, learning from experts, and gathering broader context has been part of our master plan at Quick to Listen since its inception. Hopefully your participation in this practice goes beyond our weekly podcasts. This month, CT published a piece entitled \u201cWhy We Argue Best with Our Mouths Shut.\u201d As author Christine Herman wrote: If it seems obvious that arguing is not an effective way to win someone over, it doesn\u2019t stop people from trying. From Facebook to family gatherings, our disagreements regularly erupt into arguments. \u2026 If we have any hope for healing the divisions in our society, families, churches, and communities, it will serve us well to learn how to have better conversations. Herman recently joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss what listening is and is not, why people feel loved when you ask them questions, and why changing your mind can be such a big deal.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Drawing on Vought\u2019s statement, Sanders accused Vought of being Islamophobic and making statements that were \u201cindefensible\u201d and \u201chateful\u201d and challenged his conviction that salvation was secured through Christ alone. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many Muslims there are in America.

                "summary": "Terrorism will likely be a constant part of the news cycle for the foreseeable future. Less than two weeks after a suicide bomber killed himself and more than two dozen others at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, terrorists showed up in London. Last Saturday, three men killed seven people and wounded 48 others after driving a vehicle into a crowd on London Bridge, exiting the vehicle, and proceeding to stab people. This month, the United States will sadly remember the one year anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub attacks, where a gunman killed 49 people in Orlando. Despite the rise of headlines about terrorism in recent years, these attacks on civilians aren\u2019t new. In fact, we can find references to these types of atrocities throughout the Old Testament. What\u2019s more, they\u2019re often wrestled with at a visceral level in the largest book of the Bible. \u201cOne of the biggest issues in Psalms is warfare and the threat of violence from enemies,\u201d said Tremper Longman, the author of How to Read the Psalms. In particular, the writers of the Psalms wrestle with their feelings of vindictiveness toward their enemies and desire of justice from God. At times, they even implore God to cause horror to befall their foes. However, there is one key distinction about imprecatory prayers that Christians sometimes miss, said Longman. \u201cThe psalmist isn\u2019t saying \u2018Give me the opportunity and resources and I will kill my enemies,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is turning his anger over to God and saying \u2018God you take vengeance against my enemies.\u2019 \u2026 You\u2019re taking your anger and fear to God, and you\u2019re expressing hope that God will answer you.\u201d Longman joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli on Quick to Listen to discuss whether the Bible ever justifies revenge, what the Psalms teach us about dealing with our feelings of helplessness in the face of terrorism, and how Christians can offer hope to their loved ones who do not believe in God.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Comey\u2019s decision to work for the FBI can be understood as a way of fulfilling Niebuhr\u2019s vision of Christianity as a defender of justice.\" Comey\u2019s not the only recent public figure influenced by the late theologian, whose admirers include people on the left and right, including Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama, John McCain, and David Brooks. But what shaped Niebuhr\u2019s worldview? \u201cYou really can\u2019t understand Niebuhr\u2019s political theology unless you appreciate the fact that his life was really bracketed by war,\u201d said Joseph Loconte, a history professor at The King\u2019s College in New York City. Niebuhr was a young man during World War I and had come into his own as a \u201cChristian Protestant public intellectual\u201d just prior to World War II, a period in which he embraced pacifism and socialism. As totalitarian socialism and fascism took off in the 1930s, \u201cwhat had become settled beliefs for him, now they\u2019re being upended by the realities in which he finds himself,\u201d Loconte said. Niebuhr himself admitted that his ideas shifted not as the result of \u201cstudy, but the pressure of world events,\u201d Loonte said. Loconte joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli to discuss what Niebuhr\u2019s theology does and does not justify, what America\u2019s foreign policy decisions on Iraq and Syria look like through a Niebuhrian lens, and what happens when people with good intentions make decisions with unintended consequences.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "Last week, President Trump issued an executive order. From CT\u2019s coverage: The order entitled \u201cPromoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty\u201d professes to extend political speech protections for pastors and religious organizations, aiming to let them talk about politics without penalty. The executive order\u2019s key feature: fulfilling a Trump campaign promise to end the Johnson Amendment, legislation that has discouraged non-profits, including churches, from endorsing political candidates for six decades. (Despite Trump\u2019s claims that many wanted this relief, research from last year didn\u2019t support this statement.) While most non-profits and churches have refrained from explicit endorsements, the IRS has largely taken a hands-off role in enforcing the law. \u201cThe IRS usually has not enforced the provision,\u201d said Thomas Berg, a religious liberty scholar. So what keeps the government silent? While it makes sense that the government would want a check on \u201cpowerful, tax-exempt organizations using the benefit of tax-exemption to toss the election one way or another with big money,\u201d the IRS would quickly run into First Amendment issues if it actually tried to stop churches, said Berg. Pastors could get in trouble for telling their congregations \u201cI think really the only candidate who meets the moral test is this one,\u201d said Berg. The problem is that \u201cyou can violate the provision with less explicit statements than that.\u201d Berg joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor-in-chief Mark Galli to discuss how The Christian Century lost its tax-exempt status, the case for churches to pay taxes, and the best way for pastors to shepherd their congregation on the issue of politics.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "Since the beginning of the year, more than 800 congregations in 30 American cities have joined the New Sanctuary Movement (NSM). An interfaith effort organized by Christian activist Alexia Salvatierra, NSM religious institutions have pledged to open their doors to undocumented immigrants worried that authorities may arrest them or separate their families. (Read CT\u2019s interview with Salvatierra.) At this point, most of the churches that have joined the New Sanctuary Movement are progressive congregations. New Season Christian Worship Center in Sacramento is one of the few evangelical congregations that\u2019s announced something similar, what Time Magazine recently called a \u201csafe haven\u201d program. The program is specifically focused on meeting the urgent needs of undocumented immigrants, those fleeing domestic violence, or those affected by gang fights. So far, New Season has set up more than two dozen beds for congregants looking to escape immigration raids and hosted more than half a dozen families. \u201cA safe haven is a place where we can offer a place of rest from turmoil from those things which are troubling people,\u201d said Charlie Rivera, who pastors New Season\u2019s Spanish language ministry and leads the safe haven program. \u201cWe offer a sense of hope and spiritual help.\u201d The church\u2019s program is not meant to oppose or thwart the government, said Rivera. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to break any law or do anything illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cOur main goal is to assist people who are in need.\u201d Rivera joined Morgan and Mark to discuss why he doesn\u2019t believe his church is harboring criminals, why New Season has seen a surge of Hispanic attendees, and how Christians can encourage undocumented immigrants to do the right thing. (Note: New Season\u2019s pastor, Sam Rodriguez, serves on CT\u2019s board, and recently appeared on Quick to Listen to discuss his rationale for praying at Trump\u2019s inauguration.)\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Stetzer joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor in chief Mark Galli on Quick to Listen to discuss SBC unity in light of the election and how Christian conscience should direct giving to Christian institutions.

In contrast, many African slaves were drawn to Methodism\u2019s theological emphasis on born-again conversions and total depravity and its preachers\u2019 open-air, multiethnic services, says Washington. \u201c[In Methodism,] there was no education requirement to be an exhorter or lay preacher,\u201d said Washington, who is also the director of Calvin\u2019s African and African Diaspora Studies. \u201cSo enslaved men who had a recognized gift to preach or exhort\u2014they were encouraged in that.\u201d But congregations began to split when denominations blocked African American men from taking on more official church leadership roles\u2014or, in the case of the Methodists, when church leaders threw out several of their black church members for praying in the \u201cwrong\u201d part of the church. Washington joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor-in-chief Mark Galli on Quick to Listen to discuss the Great Awakening\u2019s impact on African enslaved and free people, the overlap\u2014if any\u2014between conversion and emancipation, and the history of plantation churches.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Many criticized DeVos\u2019s nomination because she has little experience in public education. She attended a private school, and beyond mentoring in the public schools, she has never attended, taught, or sent children to public schools. A Christian, (DeVos has attended Rob Bell\u2019s former church Mars Hill) her appointment has raised questions about Christian support for public schools. In short: Can Christians who homeschool or enroll their children in private school still support public schools? One\u2019s familial education choices don\u2019t affect the extent to which one can support public schools, says Andrea Reyes Ramirez, the executive director of the Faith and Education Coalition for the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.

According to Ramirez, Christians who do opt for homeschooling or private schools should be conscientious of potential unintended consequences of their decisions. \u201cWe have to be cautious about being so focused on taking care of our own children that we isolate ourselves from the beautiful, made-in-God\u2019s-image children in our community,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great discipleship opportunity for the children in our home, to connect the dots and say, \u2018We\u2019re thinking about what\u2019s best for our family.

But it is true that the Patriots have won the Super Bowl 7 times since 2001 and the Atlanta Falcons have never even won a title, making the Falcons the inevitable favored underdog.) But beyond the actual teams, the Super Bowl stands atop a waning list of cultural events that bring America together. Last year, about 115 million Americans tuned in to watch the Broncos, the commercials, or Beyonc\u00e9.

                "summary": "If you were too busy watching college football and the NFL this weekend, maybe you missed the craziest minute of sports since the Olympics. In her first fight back after a stunning 2015 defeat, acclaimed MMA fighter Ronda Rousey lost in 48 seconds. But should Christians watch this fight at all? What are we to think of female MMA fighting itself? And what does our culture\u2019s embrace of female MMA fighting reveal about what it values and how it understands gender? These are the types of questions theologian Alastair Roberts raised in recent piece for The Gospel Coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of celebration of the strong female character, whether that\u2019s Laura Croft or Sydney Bristow. All of these characters represent an image of female strength that\u2019s very much modeled after a model of male strength. As we celebrate these images, what is the actual consequence of this for women?\u201d said Roberts, who is the author of the forthcoming Heirs Together: A Theology of the Sexes. \u201cThe more that we celebrate this sort of sport and image of female strength the more we are in danger of devaluing the sort of strength that the vast majority of women have which is a very distinct sort of strength which is not seen in pugilism or the sort of the violent conflict you see in the UFC ring.\u201d Roberts joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor-in-chief Mark Galli this week to discuss whether the sex of the person fighting affects the morality of MMA, what it will take for culture to more broadly value feminine strength, and what the ministry of women is to the church.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

It is how God has treated us and he perseveres with us through it.\u2019\u201d While the attack was the worst to target Copts since the 2011 New Year\u2019s bombing of a church in Alexandria that killed 23 people, the population has been the victim of sectarian violence for years. In 2015, ISIS, who also claimed responsibility for the latest attack, beheaded 21 Coptic Christians in Libya. Casper joined assistant editor Morgan Lee and editor-in-chief Mark Galli this week to discuss the fascinating and important history of Coptic Christians, how the Egyptian church relates to a changing government, and why this most recent attack is unique.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "Where can complementarian women go to find female teachers? For many, the answer lies outside of the local church. Because of theological beliefs, most complementarian churches don\u2019t let women preach. Many also struggle to elevate women\u2019s voices within their own congregations, indirectly encouraging women to look outside the church\u2014at times to blogs, social media, and Christian publishing\u2014for leadership. (Read CT\u2019s previous coverage.) Part of the reason for the lack of voices stems from a historic distrust of female leadership, argues Wendy Alsup, who formerly led women\u2019s ministries at Mars Hill Church in Seattle. \u201cI think more and more people who identify as complementarian are putting away suspicions that women want to remove men from their places of leadership but it\u2019s taken work to get to that place where their gifts are welcome,\u201d she said. But women\u2019s ministry can thrive in complementarian settings. A pastor and church elder board which seeks to affirm women\u2019s voices is characterized by a \u201ccelebratory attitude\u201d that values \u201cevery member of the body of a Christ,\u201d says Elizabeth Inrig, who previously led women\u2019s ministries for the Evangelical Free Church of America Inrig and Alsup joined Morgan and Richard on Quick to Listen to discuss the practical ways that complementarian churches can be intentional about including women\u2019s voices, the roles of pastors wives, and how male participation at church affects female involvement.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

They don\u2019t have the clout that they had,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Lee Anderson, the founder of Mere Orthodoxy. \u201cI think that it\u2019s way too premature to say that sort of thing. We do need a couple of election cycles\u2026One of the things that I will watch very carefully will be what happens at Liberty University on November 8.\u201d Tisby and Anderson join Morgan and Christianity Today\u2019s editor-in-chief, Mark Galli, on Quick to Listen this week to discuss what has and has not changed for evangelicals following the latest Trump scandal, how Billy Graham\u2019s political philosophy shaped Christian engagement, and what personal blind spots have been revealed in their own lives over the course of the election.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Christianity Today\u2019s first female and youngest print managing editor, the leader of This Is Our City and founder of Her.meneutics, and one of CT\u2019s first podcast hosts, Beaty cemented her legacy in her nine years at the organization. Katelyn spoke with Morgan and The Calling\u2019s Richard Clark this week on Quick to Listen as they discussed the last decade. On the success of Her.meneutics: I don\u2019t attribute that to my stealth leadership. It was really about starting a conversation, gathering more women writers, and giving them a chance to write for the print magazine\u2026A lot of those writers ended up having a larger platform to the broader church and not just staying in their lady cocoon. On her first CT editorial calling Christians to stop bashing Hillary Clinton: \u201cJim Wallis liked it. I guess that\u2019s no surprise.\u201d On reading CT in college: \u201cI remember printing [the editorials] off as if \u2018this is the premiere Christian opinion on this topic. This is a model on cultural engagement.\u2019\u201d On the importance of genre: Working on this upcoming Ann Voskamp profile, for awhile I thought, \u2018Should this just be a straight interview?\u2019 She\u2019s super interesting to listen to. Very articulate. Speaks in complete sentences which is not true of all our interview subjects. But I ultimately decided to go with the profile genre because it allowed me to draw in what others have said about her. On the internet: \u201cI think the temptation is to look at what\u2019s happening online and try to replicate it in a print magazine.\u201d\nLearn more about your ad choices.

How might we be more effective in holding ourselves as Christians accountable to his actual word? I, for one, believe that partisanship should have nothing to do with the actions of Christ. You're either Christlike, or you're not.\u201d In the past two weeks, however, Parker has come under scrutiny after Variety reported that the woman who accused Parker and his college roommate of raping her while they were students at Penn State in the late 1990s had committed suicide. That accusation had led to Parker\u2019s arrest and trial. In 2001, he was acquitted of the charges of sexual assault, and has maintained recently that what happened was consensual. His roommate\u2014who is also the film\u2019s co-writer\u2014was convicted, but the conviction was later overturned on appeal after the accuser declined to testify for a retrial. Along with Parker\u2019s faith and race, the nature of the accusations and the fact that Birth of a Nation also features a sexual assault scene has caused a maelstrom of angry, sad, and conflicted reactions. Alissa Wilkinson, Christianity Today's chief film critic, has been a fan of the film since she saw it at Sundance. \u201cI certainly believe that his faith is sincere. I believe people change and mature and grow in their faith and they often look back on things that they did when they were younger in horror,\u201d said Wilkinson. But she\u2019s been disappointed with Parker\u2019s reaction--largely because Birth of a Nation\u2019s deep understanding of systemic oppression doesn\u2019t seem to have mirrored in the filmmaker\u2019s responses about sexual assault. Christians asking why Parker \u201cshould own something he did not do,\u201d have an incomplete understanding of what Christians are called to in these situations, said Ekemini Uwan. \u201cI think a lot of Christians are calling for cheap grace, which is grace without truth, which is unacceptable,\u201d said Uwan, a recent graduate of Westminster Theological Seminary. \u201cYou don\u2019t receive salvation unless you confess sin and live in the light.\u201d Uwan and Wilkinson join Morgan and Katelyn this week to discuss how Christians should make sense of the allegations against Parker, how we understand the complicating role that race plays in our reactions, and whether or not we can separate the artist from his or her art.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Do you have dozens of hours of unwatched pool play handball games on your DVR? We have a podcast for you. Two-time Olympian Josh Davis\u2014who swam with Michael Phelps in his last Olympics\u2014and recently-returned-from-Rio correspondent Tim Ellsworth joined Quick to Listen this week.

London 2012 gold medalist David Boudia would relate to the letdown feeling, says Ellsworth, who along with Boudia, recently co-wrote Greater Than Gold: From Olympic Heartbreak to Ultimate Redemption, about the gold-medalist diver's life and faith. \u201cEven though he had become a believer and even though in 2012 he knew that a gold medal was not the pinnacle of his existence and most precious thing in his life, I think there was still a part of him that thought that that would bring a sense of satisfaction in his life that he didn\u2019t have otherwise,\u201d said Ellsworth. Instead, Boudia soon realized that few things had changed\u2014except the level of media attention and scrutiny\u2014and the temptation to \u201cput himself as the center of everything.\u201d An eventual antidote: Boudia\u2019s marriage to his wife, Sonny, and the birth of their daughter Dakota, helped him reset his priorities.

What\u2019s behind these visceral reactions? \u201cThe history of American evangelicalism is critical in understanding how many things Clinton stands for that contradict the deeply held values of politically engaged evangelicals since the 1960s,\u201d said Kristin Du Mez, a\u00a0historian at Calvin College and the author of a forthcoming book about Hillary Clinton\u2019s faith. \u201cOn so many issues, Hillary Clinton\u2014her politics and the way her faith informs [them]\u2014run against the values that the religious right has held dear. \u2026 There are very real religious and political differences here.\u201d Both Du Mez and Noble joined Morgan and Katelyn to discuss how Clinton\u2019s \u201cbaking cookie\u201d comments alienated her from stay-at-home moms, why she\u2019s largely stopped\u00a0standing up for evangelicals, and how gender has affected her popularity among Christians.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

And so, I\u2019m reminded of a passage in John\u2019s Gospel, \u2018let us love, not with words or speech, but with actions and in truth.\u2019\u201d (Note: We\u2019re aware that the president actually quoted 1 John.) In the wake of last week\u2019s shootings, Joshua DuBois, the former head of the White House\u2019s Office of Faith Based Partnerships, responded with action, creating a form letter for citizens to send their local police chiefs. As of writing, the tweet has been retweeted nearly 5,000 times. \u201cI live outside of DC and realized I had never had a conversation with my police chief in my town...I wanted to have that dialogue to affirm the hard and difficult work that police officers are engaged in every day, but also to ask questions about how prepared they are to deescalate conflict and address bias,\u201d said DuBois, who now leads Values Partnership, a consulting firm. \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating is that people are writing their own chiefs and their chiefs are responding,\u201d DuBois joined Morgan and Katelyn this week to discuss what led him to create this letter, how majority culture Christians can avoid shutting down conversations with those of color, and why anger should not be a deterrent to engagement. (10:10) Joshua, what went into your decision to create this police department form letter? (15:08) In circumstances like last week, what voices should be elevated? How should they be elevated? (20:25) What is a powerful example of what solidarity looks like?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices"

You probably know what happened next. Last week, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump went after the judge presiding over the civil fraud lawsuits\u2014because of his ethnicity. \u201cHe's Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico,\u201d said Trump, who claimed that the Indiana-born US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel faced an \u201cabsolute conflict,\u201d in ruling on the billionaire\u2019s case. Trump\u2019s words were the \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment,\u201d said GOP Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Trump has since suggested that his remarks were \u201cmisconstrued.\u201d Trump\u2019s words were wrong, but it\u2019s also incorrect to think that someone can do their jobs without their ethnic background coming into play, said Gabriel Salguero, the founder and president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, who joined Quick to Listen this week. \u201cGod\u2019s sovereign will places us into the context into which we\u2019re born,\u201d said Salguero. \u201cDoes that impact how we see the world? Of course it does! The Christian shouldn\u2019t see diversity as a deficit but as a gift.\u201d One reason why we often see others as threats: fears of limited resources, says Alma Zaragoza-Petty, the daughter of Mexican immigrants. who recently completed her Ph.D in educational policy and social context at UC Irvine and who also came on\u00a0Quick to Listen. But \u201cGod\u2019s love is abundant,\u201d said Zaragoza-Petty. Zaragoza-Petty and Salguero joined Morgan and Katelyn on Quick to Listen this week to talk about whether a person\u2019s ethnicity should affect how their work and who decides who gets to be an America. (6:50) Are there times when our ethnic background actually should or can influence the way we do our jobs? (14:50) How do we determine who is an American, and who gets to decide that?

                "summary": "Everything\u2019s possible if you work hard enough. At least that\u2019s what shows Biggest Loser (NBC), Extreme Weight Loss (ABC) and Fit to Fat to Fit (A&E) suggest to their audiences. But it\u2019s not necessarily true, as The New York Times reported this week in an in-depth examination about the lives of Biggest Loser contestants\u2014many of whom regained the weight they had lost over the course of the show after they left. As the Times reports, biology\u2014specifically one\u2019s metabolism\u2014plays a significant role in determining a person\u2019s weight and their ability to lose weight. This news may bring relief to the former contestants, but it also ought to challenge society about its own assumptions about individuals and weight. \u201cAs Christians we want to be welcoming to everyone and not judge someone based on their size but when it gets down to it, a lot of times we may think What is wrong with this person that they haven\u2019t taken care of their health?\u201d says CT\u2019s online associate editor and reality television show fan Kate Shellnutt. Shellnutt joins Morgan and Katelyn this week in Quick to Listen to discuss the relationship between social media and weight loss, how reality TV shames the wrong people, and how we can honor ourselves. One of the main contestants profiled in the NYT piece is a pastor in North Carolina who gained back a significant amount of weight after going on the show. He says his metabolism is now so slow, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like hearing you have a life sentence.\" How does this idea challenge common conceptions about people who are overweight or obese, such as, \"It's all their fault,\" \"they're lazy,\" etc.? What's going on in our attraction to reality TV shows? How do they speak to our particular cultural moment or spiritual desires? What's holistic health? Are there specific ways Christian communities can lead on the issue of holistic health?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices"

The majority of the victims were Muslim, but its targets were Christians, a spokesperson for the terrorist group said. Life hasn\u2019t been easy for Pakistani Christians in the past 50 years, says K. A. Ellis, an ambassador for the Christian persecution advocacy group, International Christian Response, who points to the country\u2019s blasphemy laws and recent terrorist bombings of churches. \u201cIf it\u2019s hubris to violate the image of God in any innocent being, it seems an even more profound offense to violate the name of Christ that believers bear,\u201d says Ellis, a Ph.D. candidate in Church History at Oxford Center for Mission Studies. \u201cGod is grieved by the death of all men, but those who bear his name are precious in his sight.\u201d Ellis joins Morgan and Katelyn this week as they process how Western Christians should grieve and act following this latest attack. What makes the Pakistan attack unique? What types of stories about persecution make the most prominent headlines? Should Christians grieve the death of other Christians differently than they do other victims? What can our support for persecuted Christians look like?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
