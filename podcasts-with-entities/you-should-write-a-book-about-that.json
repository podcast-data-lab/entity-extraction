You may not have slept with the UPS guy but you are married 26 years and still holding a torch for that first boyfriend in high school. You\u2019ve guzzled champagne to give a speech or peed yourself when you laughed too hard. Secrets big and small create shame and play on our expectations that we have to be perfect as women. Our judgements hold us back from living our best life. Author Gretchen Hydo, a Certified Master Coach, says it\u2019s time to stop. Enough stuffing secrets, and then creating more. As a coach to business owners and coaches, she is tough and results oriented, helping men and women exponentially increase their income.

                "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can do something as simple as buy a house and write a whole novel around it. We think we need these epic tragedies or great successes to justify writing as our unique selves. Look around!\u00a0 There is material happening everywhere and self-awareness is key to developing a commentary and a narrative about your life. When we tune in creatively, the world is real time offering us endless amounts of material. Let that endless monkey mind work in your favor and get it down in the computer.\u00a0 In today\u2019s episode, host Kim O\u2019Hara shares her creative journey writing about her house buying experience and her first year as a single woman homesteader in Los Angeles. Called a mix between Pema Chodron and Anne Lamott (which makes her blush), Kim shares how she allows life to unfold over the year and makes a point to write about each experience from a gunman on her roof (and the crappy boyfriend who never checks on her), to an evolving and spiritual battle with nine foot palm fronds. She doesn\u2019t miss a bit of detail and peppers in comedy, as well as her continual struggle with faith, fear and loneliness.\u00a0</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t wait ten years to start writing about your emotions and observations while they are happening real time, especially if you have taken a leap in your life. For Kim, buying a house was a huge accomplishment, and her trials and tribulations that range from micromanaging growing grass to stray cat management gives courage to others to step up and make a leap as homeowners, or whatever area in their lives that calls for meaning!\u00a0 Go towards what makes you happy when you write, and what thematically fills your writing cup, instructs Kim.
