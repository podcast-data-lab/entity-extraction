We cover the current state of the tools and technologies in use, why companies are adopting continuous intelligence to remain competitive, and we even get a bit into what the future of data processing and analysis will look like.\n\nRead a transcript of this interview:  https://bit.ly/3iDmQ0i\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters:\n- The InfoQ weekly newsletter: bit.ly/24x3IVq\n- The Software Architects\u2019 Newsletter [monthly]: www.infoq.com/software-architects-newsletter/\n\nUpcoming Virtual Events - https://events.infoq.com/\n\nInfoQ Live: https://live.infoq.com/\n- June 22, 2021\n- July 20, 2021\n- August 17, 2021\n\nFollow InfoQ:\n- Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\n- LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\n- Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\n- Instagram: @infoqdotcom\n- Youtube: www.youtube.com/infoq"

ZooKeeper is used to maintain the metadata store required to operate Kafka. While ZooKeepers removal from Kafka will simplify the operational complexity and improve some of the scalability aspects of the platform, it is a huge undertaking that represents major changes to the overall architecture. Justin Gustafson and Colin McCabe are two engineers working on change. On the podcast, the three discuss why the team made this decision, what the ramifications are, and explore what both the near and future state will be with upgrading and operating Kafka.\n\nListen to the podcast for more.\n\nCurated transcript and more information on the https://bit.ly/2H5w3hN\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Youtube: @InfoQ \nFollow us on Instagram: @infoqdotcom\n\nStay informed on emerging trends, peer-validated early adoption of technologies, and architectural best practices.

Topics discussed included: the adoption of hybrid cloud across organisations, the evolution of Kubernetes as a key abstraction for portability and cross-cloud security, running thousands of Kubernetes clusters at the edge, and the value of open standards.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast\n\n - Organisations are adopting hybrid cloud strategies. The use of containers to package and run applications across clouds has seen large adoption over the past five years. Containers and Kubernetes are everywhere: the datacenter, the edge, embedded systems, and other locations.\n - Two enterprise use cases for Kubernetes stand out: providing standardised abstractions and APIs to increase portability across vendors and cloud platforms; and providing a framework and homogenised foundation on which to build and implement (cross cloud) security solutions.\n - Open standards support interoperability and drive innovation. The CNCF is becoming the natural home for open cloud technologies. The Rancher team have donated Longhorn, their cloud-native distributed storage platform for Kubernetes that was recently announced as generally available, to the CNCF.\n - With the success of lightweight Kubernetes distributions, such as Rancher\u2019s K3s, engineers are starting to deploy standalone Kubernetes clusters \u201cby the thousands\u201d to edge locations. Rancher has recently released Fleet, a new open source project that is focused on managing large collections (\u201cfleets\u201d) of Kubernetes clusters.\n - Many developers and end users of Kubernetes simply want a platform-as-a-service (PaaS)-like experience.

Topics discussed included: chaos engineering and resilience engineering, planning and running effective chaos experiments, and learning from incidents.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - The chaos engineering and resilience engineering fields, although inextricably linked, are often incorrectly conflated. Resilience engineering is focused on \u201cidentifying and then enhancing the positive capabilities of people in organizations that allow them to adapt effectively and safely under varying circumstances.\u201d\n - The UX of internal or engineering-focused tooling, such as chaos experimentation tooling, is extremely important. However, engineers that create these tools often overlook the value of UX, or don\u2019t have the relevant skills in user design research to undertake this.\n - We all work in socio-technical systems. It is important to take the time to understand both aspects. Developing empathy and working alongside teams that you are trying to influence is essential. It is extremely important to continually work to build correct \u201cmental models\u201d of a system.\n - The before and after of running a chaos experiment is as important as running the experiment itself. However, the aspects of planning, creating effective hypotheses, and analysing and disseminating the results are often under-resourced.\n - Incident analysis can be a catalyst to help you understand more about your system.

Topics discussed included: metrics collection at scale, multi-dimensional metrics and high-cardinality, developer experience with platform tooling, and open standards related to observability.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Over the past ten years the requirements related to monitoring and alerting, and the approach taken to implement this, has changed considerably.

The ability to build Go applications into a static binary reduces the need for dependency management, and the quick runtime and application start time is good for initiation and scaling\n - The FaaS development toolchain has improved over the years. Many cloud providers now provide local runtimes, e.g. AWS SAM Local, and service simulators, e.g. LocalStack. Testing in production is facilitated by the ability to do dark launches and canary releasing at the ingress/API gateway\n - Developing \u201cserverless\u201d applications typically does not remove the need for operational expertise on a development team. Designing systems appropriately and getting the most out of the runtime (with minimal cost) requires knowledge of the underlying infrastructure components\n - The role of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) looks different across practically every organisation. The Heroku SRE team have adapted well-established patterns and practices into their roles. They act as \u201cdiplomats\u201d, working closely with product teams to share knowledge around operational best practices\n - The ability to teach is a valuable skill, regardless of your job. Teaching people to code or to embrace important operational principles is extremely rewarding.  - Engineers who teach must seek to escape the pull of their ego; by focusing on the needs of the people you are teaching, much more progress can be made.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2UV0tqK\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2UV0tqK",

Topics discussed included: the motivations for GraphQL, the Apollo Data Graph platform, data modelling in an enterprise context, and how incrementally adopting GraphQL can help with decoupling the evolution of frontend and backend systems.\n\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - The challenges of defining client-side-friendly data models, building maintainable and composable backend APIs, and moving data from the cloud to a client application contributes to making modern software development difficult and time consuming. \n - GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. GraphQL lets application developers describe the data they need and bring that data into the screens that they are building for their users.\n - The Apollo Data Graph platform is a middleware layer that provides a way of decoupling the core business APIs from the client-side consumption patterns. Apollo can implement cross-cutting concerns, such as transaction management, which mitigates the need to implement this in (potentially multiple) client-side applications.\n- Apollo makes it possible to build a \u201cdata graph\u201d: a series of graphs that are composed from an organisation\u2019s data for use within client-side applications. A data graph is especially valuable in larger enterprises because it is here that many (money making) systems with existing APIs need to be combined to meet new business requirements.\n - GraphQL can be adopted in an incremental fashion. To begin adoption just build the simplest possible graph that matches the needs of the first application, the first screen, or the first component that is required to transition over to the graph.

This has evolved from library based implementations, such as Airbnb\u2019s SmartStack or Netflix\u2019s OSS libraries.\n - The recent release of Istio 1.5 saw the deployment packaging of the control plane move from a microservice-based approach to that of a monolithic implementation, named \u201cistiod\u201d.\n - Istio now also supports data plane extensions written in WebAssembly (Wasm). These extensions can modify requests and responses and perform out-of-band actions, such as authentication and authorization.\n - Standardisations like the Service Mesh Interface (SMI) can add a lot of value, but the user requirements, common use cases, and the core abstractions of the underlying technology must be well understood.\n - Multi-cluster and mesh expansion (out-of-cluster) support is continually improving in Istio and many other service mesh implementations.",

The podcast covers many of the topics, techniques, and patterns that Sam writes about in his latest book, Monolith to Microservices: Evolutionary Patterns to Transform Your Monolith. Topics covered in the podcast include understanding the problem you\u2019re trying to solve, organizational/people changes when it comes to microservice architectures, database strategies for decomposing monolithic datastores, and why we\u2019re seeing projects reverting from microservices to monoliths. \n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Fundamentally, microservices are distributed systems. Distributed systems have baggage (complexity) that comes along with them. The best way to deal with this complexity is not to address it. Try to solve the problem in other ways before choosing to take an organization to microservices.\n - A common issue that large enterprises run into that might be a strong indicator for implementing microservices occurs when lots of developers are working on a given problem and they\u2019re getting in each other\u2019s way.\n - A useful structure to follow with microservices is to make sure each service is owned by exactly one team. One team can own more than one service but having clear ownership of who owns a service helps in some of the operational challenges with microservices.\n - A release train should be a stop in the journey towards continuous delivery. It\u2019s not the destination. If you find that you can only release in a release train, you are likely building a distributed monolith.\n - There are challenges of operating microservices when the end customer has to operate and manage it. These challenges are part of why we\u2019re seeing projects move from microservices to process monoliths.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2XvGzmF\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2XvGzmF",

The Tekton Pipelines project provides Kubernetes-style custom resources for declaring continuous integration and delivery pipelines. Spinnaker can use Tekton as its pipeline engine.\n - In addition to providing a neutral home for projects within the CD space, the CDF is also aiming to help define appropriate terminology, open standards, and abstractions. This will assist with interoperability between CD components, and also promote innovation in the areas that can provide the most value.\n - The CDF is also aiming to facilitate software testing, progressive delivery, and software supply chain management.

Abbott, CEO and co-founder of AKF Partners, and Cordrey, partner at AKF Partners, discussed topics that included: their learning from working together in the early days of eBay, why and how to avoid creating software systems that are composed of deep call chains of microservices, and how to build effective product teams.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - First introduced in the book \u201cThe Art of Scalability\u201d, the AKF Scale Cube is a model for segmenting software components, defining microservices, and scaling products. It also creates a common language for teams to discuss scale related options in designing solutions.\n - The microservice architectural pattern is best used for implementing the \u201cbreadth\u201d of business functionality. Engineers should avoid building deep call chains of services, as this can increase the probability of failure, and can also increase the challenges of locating and diagnosing issues. Code libraries can often be used more effectively to implement \u201cdepth\u201d within services.\n - The AKF Availability Cube is a new model to guide discussions on how to achieve high availability. This model can also be used as a mathematical tool to evaluate the theoretical \u201cas designed\u201d availability of existing systems.\n - Building products using cross-functional teams is an effective approach. However, care should be taken not to accidentally create unnecessarily large teams, as this can add communication and coordination friction to the delivery process.\n - Teams should make a conscious choice to adopt new technologies, and understand the benefits and tradeoffs with doing so. Managing risk, and in particular, technology lifespan risk, is an important part of the value engineers provide to the business.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2AbpZjT\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2AbpZjT",

At this point many teams choose to build a custom platform using cloud technologies, such as Kubernetes. \n - Building a Kubernetes platform can be an effective solution, but appropriate effort needs to be put into designing, building, and maintaining the platform. The platform effectively becomes another product within the business that must be managed accordingly.\n - Embracing open standards provides many benefits, especially for the long term. Implementations that are consumed through well-defined interfaces and abstraction can be more readily swapped at a later point in time. It is also generally easier to integrate components that share common interfaces.\n - Attention and resources must be provided to create an effective developer experience for the platform. It is essential to prioritize self-service operations, and also to understand the core requirements of the engineers and QA specialists that will be using the platform during their daily work.\n - Establishing an effective continuous delivery pipeline can enable more repeatable and scalable testing of applications, and also allows the codification of cross-functional requirements.\n - The cloud native landscape has now evolved to a point where most of the frameworks and tooling required to build a platform have become viable for general purpose usage.

The tools parse the declarative configuration and take appropriate action to enact the specified state, for example, calling SDKs and APIs, verifying results, iterating etc.\n\u25cf\tPulumi is an open source framework that enables engineers to define IaC using general purpose programming languages, such as Node, Python, .NET Core, and Go.\n\u25cf\tPulumi allows imperative specification of IaC. Engineers can use their favourite language-specific features, idioms, and patterns. The use of language modules, packages, and libraries can also enable code reuse.\n\u25cf\tUnder the hood, Pulumi transforms code written in the supported languages to a declarative specification model.

Key topics include Dojo\u2019s adoption of Typescript, web components, and client-side libraries such as Svelte and Stencil.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Modern Dojo (2.0 and upwards) is focussed on being a very small, opinionated reactive framework, but with a lot of the components you need to build a modern JavaScript application built in.\n - The framework tries to align closely to standards, for example using Web Components extensively for UI components, alongside ES modules and promises. The use of standards, as well as the convergence towards the reactive programming model for web UI, has improved interoperability, though there are some limitations such as the lack of an easy way to share resources across web components.  \n - Dojo was one of the first frameworks to make the decision to switch to Typescript, though it took some time to make that transition. The switch was mainly motivated by TypeScript\u2019s support for interfaces, but it wasn\u2019t until Typescript 2.6 they felt able to ship Dojo 2.\n - On the client side we\u2019re paying close attention to Svelte and Stencil as two particularly interesting client-side frameworks. \n - We\u2019ve moved Web Components from early adopter to early majority on the trend report, based on the fact that all browsers accept IE now natively support it, but also large companies such as Apple, Nike and ESPN are deploying web components and their sites. Apple\u2019s iTunes implementation, for example, now uses web components.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2Qy75Jr\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2Qy75Jr",

Topics covered included Kubernetes as a platform, application abstractions, continuous delivery, and implementing good security practices in the cloud native space.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - The value provided by Kubernetes depends on an organisation\u2019s context. Kubernetes acts as both a series of lower-level building blocks for a platform, and also as a very powerful API for deploying and operating container-based applications.\n - Kubernetes provides several useful abstractions for engineers. For example, Pods, Deployments, and Services. However, Kubernetes doesn\u2019t have an \u201capplication\u201d-focused abstraction. Tools such as Helm and specifications like the Cloud Native Application Bundle (CNAB) are driving innovation in this space.\n - There is a large amount of open source Kubernetes tooling. This has been created by a range of vendors, groups, and individuals. Encouraging this diverse mix of participation is beneficial for the long-term health of the ecosystem. \n - The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) provides a space for people to collaborate regardless of their current organisational affiliations.\n - Defining appropriate standards within the cloud native space is useful for enabling interoperability and providing common foundations for others to innovate on top of. \n - Security challenges within IT are socio-technical. Security teams working with cloud native technologies will benefit from continual learning, developing new skills, and researching new tools. For example, the defaults of Kubernetes aren\u2019t necessarily secure, but this can be readily addressed with appropriate configuration.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/38PLPFb\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/38PLPFb",

                "summary": "In this podcast, Daniel Bryant sat down with Gareth Rushgrove, Director of Product Management at Snyk. Topics covered included Kubernetes as a platform, application abstractions, continuous delivery, and implementing good security practices in the cloud native space.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - The value provided by Kubernetes depends on an organisation\u2019s context. Kubernetes acts as both a series of lower-level building blocks for a platform, and also as a very powerful API for deploying and operating container-based applications.\n - Kubernetes provides several useful abstractions for engineers. For example, Pods, Deployments, and Services. However, Kubernetes doesn\u2019t have an \u201capplication\u201d-focused abstraction. Tools such as Helm and specifications like the Cloud Native Application Bundle (CNAB) are driving innovation in this space.\n - There is a large amount of open source Kubernetes tooling. This has been created by a range of vendors, groups, and individuals. Encouraging this diverse mix of participation is beneficial for the long-term health of the ecosystem. \n - The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) provides a space for people to collaborate regardless of their current organisational affiliations.\n - Defining appropriate standards within the cloud native space is useful for enabling interoperability and providing common foundations for others to innovate on top of. \n - Security challenges within IT are socio-technical. Security teams working with cloud native technologies will benefit from continual learning, developing new skills, and researching new tools. For example, the defaults of Kubernetes aren\u2019t necessarily secure, but this can be readily addressed with appropriate configuration.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/38PLPFb\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/38PLPFb"

Topics covered included: the evolution of cloud platforms; simplifying developer experience; running large-scale workloads on Kubernetes; and the future of tooling and platforms within the cloud native computing space.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Render is aiming to be the next generation of cloud provider. Developers deploy and manage applications via a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) -like experience using custom simplified YAML configuration.\n - Render is built on top of Kubernetes, but the internals and configuration of this orchestration framework is not exposed to end user developers.\n - Many large scale usages of traditional cloud vendor platforms require the formation of specialised in-house \u201cDevOps\u201d teams. The provision of virtualisation and API-driven operation via the cloud providers was revolutionary, but it didn\u2019t fundamentally change the existing platform paradigm.\n - Arguably platform usability may have taken a step back with the arrival of public cloud vendor platforms. For example, developers may just want to write code, and not have to write complicated deployment descriptors. Operations team may want to focus on supporting engineers and advising on performance and scale, rather maintaining cloud provisioning scripts.\n - The Render team are planning to run all future workloads of self-managed Kubernetes, rather than use a hosted offering, due to them experiencing implementation bugs when running their clusters at medium-to-large scale.\n - The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is encouraging large amounts of innovation within the cloud platform space.

The two discuss the Three Pillars of Solo around Gloo, their API gateway, interoperability of service meshes (including the work on Service Mesh Interface), and on extending Envoy with Web Assembly (and the recently announced Web Assembly Hub).\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Gloo is a Kubernetes-native ingress controller and API gateway. It\u2019s built on top of Envoy and at its core is open source.\n - The Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a specification for service meshes that runs on Kubernetes. It defines a common standard that can be implemented by a variety of providers. The idea of SMI is it\u2019s an abstraction on top of service meshes, so that you can use one language to configure them all.\n - Autopilot is an open-source Kubernetes operator that allows developers to extend a service mesh control plane. \n - Lua has been commonly used to extend the service mesh data plane. Led by Google and the Envoy community, web assembly is becoming the preferred way of extending the data plane. Web assembly allows you to write Envoy extensions in any language while still being sandboxed and performant.\n - WebAssembly Hub is a service for building, deploying, sharing, and discovering Wasm extensions for Envoy.\n - Wasme is a docker like an open-source commandline tool from Solo to simplify the building, pushing, pulling, and deploying Envoy Web Assembly Filters.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/37sYIoE\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/37sYIoE"

Debezium is an open-source distributed platform for change data capture (CDC). On the show, the two discuss the project and many of its use cases. Additionally, topics covered on the podcast include bootstrapping, configuration, challenges, debugging, and operational modes. The show wraps with long term strategic goals for the project.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - CDC is a set of software design patterns used to react to changing data in a data store. Used for things like internal changelogs, integrations, replication, and event streaming, CDC can be implemented leveraging queries or against the DB transaction log. Debezium leverages the transaction log to implement CDC and is extremely performant.\n - Debezium has mature source and sink connectors for MySQL, SQL Server, and MongoDB. In addition, there are Incumbating connectors for Cassandra, Oracle, and DB2. Community sink connectors have been created for ElasticSearch.\n - In a standard deployment, Debezium leverages a Kafka cluster by deploying connectors into Kafka Connect. The connectors establish a connection to the source database and then write changes to a Kafka topic. \n - Debezium can be run in embedded mode. Embedded mode imports Java library into your own project and leverages callbacks for change events. The library approach allows Debezium implementations against other tools like AWS Kinesis or Azure's Event Hub. Going forward, there are plans to make a ready-made Debezium runtime.   \n - Out of the box, Debezium has a one-to-one mapping between tables and Kafka topic queues. The default approach exposes the internal table structure to the outside. One approach to address exposing DB internals is to leverage the Outbox Pattern. The Outbox Pattern uses a separate outbox table as a source. Inserts into your normal business logic tables also make writes to the outbox. Change events are then published to Kafka from the outbox source table.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/3737GZB\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/3737GZB",

Topics covered included: the extensibility of Kubernetes, and why it has become the platform that other platforms are being built on top of; creating event-driven architectures and deploying these onto Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms like the Kubernetes-based Knative and Google Cloud Run; and the benefits of learning, sharing knowledge, and building communities.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n\n - Kubernetes is a platform for building platforms. It may not be as opinionated as traditional Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings, but it has become popular due to its extensibility. There are PaaS-like solutions built on top of Kubernetes, such as OpenShift, Knative, and Cloud Run.\n - The creation of common interfaces within Kubernetes -- such as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), Container Networking Interface (CNI), and Container Runtime Interface (CRI) -- enabled the adoption of the platform by vendors and the open source community without everyone needing to agree on exactly how to implement extensions.\n - Although not every workload can be effectively implemented using an event-driven architecture, for those that can the Kubernetes-based Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms like Knative and Cloud Run can handle a lot of the operational management tasks for developers.\n - Engineers may be able to get ~90% of the \u201cservice mesh\u201d traffic management functionality they need from using a simple proxy.  \nHowever, the separation of the control and data planes within modern service meshes, in combination with the rise in popularity of the sidecar deployment model, has provided many benefits within Kubernetes.\n - A lot of learning within software development and information technology is transferable.

Topics covered included: exploring the architecture of the Cond\u00e9 Nast Kubernetes-based platform; the importance of enabling self-service deployment for developers; and how the Kubernetes\u2019 Federation API and Cluster API may enable more opportunities for platform automation.\n\n - Founded in the early 1900s, Cond\u00e9 Nast is a global media company that has recently migrated their application deployment platforms from individually-curated geographically-based platforms, to a standardised distributed platform based on Kubernetes and AWS.\n - The Cond\u00e9 Nast engineering team create and manage their own Kubernetes clusters, currently using CoreOS\u2019s/Red Hat\u2019s Tectonic tool. \nSelf-service deployment of applications is managed via Helm Charts.  - The platform team works closely with their \u201ccustomer\u201d developer teams in order to ensure their requirements are being met.\n - The Kubernetes Federation API makes it easy to orchestrate the deployment of applications to multiple clusters. This works well for cookie-cutter style deployments that only require small configuration differences, such as scaling the number of running applications based on geographic traffic patterns.\n - The Cluster API is a Kubernetes project to bring declarative APIs to cluster creation, configuration, and management. This enables more effective automation for cluster lifecycle management, and may provide more opportunities for multi-cloud Kubernetes use.\n - The Cond\u00e9 Nast platform Kubernetes Ingress is handled by Traefik, due to the good Helm support and cloud integration (for example, AWS Route 53 and IAM rule synchronization). The platform team is exploring the use of service mesh for 2020.\n - Abstractions, interfaces, and security will be interesting focal points for improvement in the Kubernetes ecosystem in 2020.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2FeYPrE\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2FeYPrE",

Josh, along with color commentary such as the move from IC to manager (and back), discusses recommendations, tips, tools, and lessons Slack engineering teams discovered while building products like Slack Search. The podcast covers machine learning, observability, data engineering, and general practices for building highly resilient software.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Slack has a philosophy of building only what they need. They have a don\u2019t reinvent the wheel mindset. \n - Slack was originally a PHP monolith. Today, it is largely Hack-lang, HHVM, and several Java and Go binarys. On the data side, application logs are in Thrift (there is a plan to migrate to protobuf). Events are processed through a Kafka cluster that handles 100,000s of events per second. Everything is kept in S3 with a large Hive metastore. EMR is spun up on demand. Presto, Airflow, Slack, Snowflake (business analytics), Quiver (key value store) are all used. \n - ML worked best for Slack when it was used to help people answer questions. Things like Learn to Rank (LTR) become the most effective use of ML for Slack.\n - You can get pretty far with rules. Use machine learning when that\u2019s all that\u2019s left. \n - When you start applying observability to your data pipeline, a key lesson for Slack was to really focus on structured data, tracing, high cardinality events. This let them really use the tools they were already familiar with (ELK, Prometheus, Grafana) and go deep into understanding what\u2019s happening in the systems.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2PsVA4q\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2PsVA4q",

Topics covered included: the challenges with deploying applications into Kubernetes, using the open source Octant tool to increase a user\u2019s understanding of Kubernetes clusters, and how \u201cserverless\u201d technologies may influence the future approaches to building software.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Octant is a highly extensible platform for developers to better understand the complexity of Kubernetes clusters. Octant runs locally, using the local Kubernetes credentials. It currently displays information about a Kubernetes cluster and related applications as a web page. Soon this tool and resulting display will be provided as a standalone application.\n - The goal of Octant is to enable users to discover what they need to discover. The tool aims to provide context relevant to where a user is and what they are trying to achieve. The Octant plugin system allows integration with other tooling, such as logging and metrics frameworks. This aims to facilitate quick problem detection and resolution.\n - Cloud native platforms like Kubernetes are complicated, as there are lots of moving parts. The most important challenge to be tackled to increase the adoption of platforms like Kubernetes is \u201chow do we move code from our IDEs to wherever it needs to run with the least amount of friction?\u201d. Testing needs to be implicit, as does security verification, and the acts of deployment. Kubernetes needs its \u201cRuby on Rails\u201d moment.\n - Creating \u201cserverless\u201d systems is an interesting approach, but we may currently be using this technology in a non-optimal way. For example, creating web applications using this technology enables scalability, but can lead to the creation of difficult to understand systems that also require a lot of boilerplate configuration. Arguably, a more interesting use case is implementing large-scale batch processing using simple event-driven models.\n- The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has created a series of communities of practice called Special Interest Groups (SIGs), such as SIG App Delivery. This allows folks with similar interests to work together as a community, focusing on solving a specific set of well-scoped problems. There are many ways to get involved, from discussions, to coding and creating documentation.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/37iUwIG\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/37iUwIG",

                "summary": "Victor Dibia is a Research Engineer with Cloudera\u2019s Fast Forward Labs. On today\u2019s podcast, Wes and Victor talk about the realities of building machine learning in the browser. The two discuss the capabilities, limitations, process, and realities around using TensorFlow.js. The two wrap discussing techniques like Model distillation that may enable machine learning models to be deployed in smaller footprints like serverless.\n - While there are limitations in running machine learning processes in a resource constrained environment like the browser, there are tools like TensorFlow.js that make it worthwhile. One powerful use case is the ability to protect the privacy of a user base while still making recommendations. \nTensorFlow.js takes advantage of the WebGL library for its more computational intense operations.\n - TensorFlow.js enables workflows for training and scoring models (doing inference) purely online, by importing a model built offline with more tradition Python tools, and a hybrid approach that builds offline and finetunes online.\nTo build an offline model, you can build a model with TensorFlow Python (perhaps using a GPU cluster). The model can be exported into the TensorFlow SaveModel Format (or the Keras Model Format) and then converted with TensorFlow.js into the TensorFlow Web Model Format. At that point, the can be directly imported into your JavaScript. \n - TensorFlow Hub is a library for the publication, discovery, and consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models and was made available by the Google AI team. It can give developers a quick jumpstart into using trained models.\n - Model compression promises to make models small enough to run in places we couldn\u2019t run models before. Model distillation is a process where a smaller model is trained to replicate the behavior of a larger one. In one case, BERT (a library almost 500MB in size) was distilled to about 7MB (almost 60x compression).\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/32rWnab\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/32rWnab"

For example, at Netflix if the customer playback initiation \u201cstreams per second\u201d metric declines rapidly, this may be an indication that something has broken.\n - Focusing on how things go right can provide valuable insight into the resilience within your system e.g. what are people doing everyday that helps us overcome incidents.

            "content": "In this podcast we sit down with Oliver Gould, co-founder and CTO of Buoyant. Oliver has a strong background in networking, architecture and observability, and worked on solving associated technical challenges at both Yahoo! and Twitter. Oliver is a regular presenter at cloud and infrastructure conferences, and alongside his co-founder William Morgan, you can often find them in the hallway track, waxing lyrical about service mesh -- a term they practically coined -- and trying to bring others along on the journey.\n\nService mesh technology is still young, and the ecosystem is still very much a work in progress, but there have been several recent interesting developments within this space. One of these was the announcement of the service mesh interface (SMI) at the recent KubeCon EU in Barcelona. The SMI spec seeks to unlock service mesh integrators and implementers, as this can provide an abstraction that removes the need to bet on any single service mesh implementation. This can be good for both tool makers and enterprise early adopters. Many organisations like Microsoft and HashiCorp are involved with working alongside the community to help define the SMI, including Buoyant.\n\nIn this podcast we summarise the evolution of the service mesh concept, with a focus on the three pillars: visibility, security, and reliability. We explore the new traffic \u201ctap\u201d feature within Linkerd that allows near real time in-situ querying of metrics, and discuss how to implement network security by leveraging the primitives like Service Account provided by Kubernetes. We also discuss how reliability features, such as retries, time outs, and circuit-breakers are becoming table stakes for infrastructure platforms.\n\nWe also cover the evolution of the service mesh interface, explore how service meses may impact development and platforms in the future, and briefly discuss some of the benefits offered by the Rust language in relation to building a data plane for Linkerd. We conclude the podcast with a discussion of the importance of community building.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - A well-implemented service mesh can make a distributed software system more observable. Linkerd 2.0 supports both the emitting of mesh telemetry for offline analysis, and also the ability to \u201ctap\u201d communications and make queries dynamically against the data. The Linkerd UI currently makes use the tap functionality.\n - Linkerd aims to make the implementation of secure service-to-service communication easy, and it does this by leveraging existing Kubernetes primitives. For example, Service Accounts are used to bootstrap the notion of identity, which in turn is used as a basis for Linkerd\u2019s mTLS implementation.\n - Offering reliability is \u201ctable stakes\u201d for any service mesh.

            "contentSnippet": "In this podcast we sit down with Oliver Gould, co-founder and CTO of Buoyant. Oliver has a strong background in networking, architecture and observability, and worked on solving associated technical challenges at both Yahoo! and Twitter. Oliver is a regular presenter at cloud and infrastructure conferences, and alongside his co-founder William Morgan, you can often find them in the hallway track, waxing lyrical about service mesh -- a term they practically coined -- and trying to bring others along on the journey.\n\nService mesh technology is still young, and the ecosystem is still very much a work in progress, but there have been several recent interesting developments within this space. One of these was the announcement of the service mesh interface (SMI) at the recent KubeCon EU in Barcelona. The SMI spec seeks to unlock service mesh integrators and implementers, as this can provide an abstraction that removes the need to bet on any single service mesh implementation. This can be good for both tool makers and enterprise early adopters. Many organisations like Microsoft and HashiCorp are involved with working alongside the community to help define the SMI, including Buoyant.\n\nIn this podcast we summarise the evolution of the service mesh concept, with a focus on the three pillars: visibility, security, and reliability. We explore the new traffic \u201ctap\u201d feature within Linkerd that allows near real time in-situ querying of metrics, and discuss how to implement network security by leveraging the primitives like Service Account provided by Kubernetes. We also discuss how reliability features, such as retries, time outs, and circuit-breakers are becoming table stakes for infrastructure platforms.\n\nWe also cover the evolution of the service mesh interface, explore how service meses may impact development and platforms in the future, and briefly discuss some of the benefits offered by the Rust language in relation to building a data plane for Linkerd. We conclude the podcast with a discussion of the importance of community building.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - A well-implemented service mesh can make a distributed software system more observable. Linkerd 2.0 supports both the emitting of mesh telemetry for offline analysis, and also the ability to \u201ctap\u201d communications and make queries dynamically against the data. The Linkerd UI currently makes use the tap functionality.\n - Linkerd aims to make the implementation of secure service-to-service communication easy, and it does this by leveraging existing Kubernetes primitives. For example, Service Accounts are used to bootstrap the notion of identity, which in turn is used as a basis for Linkerd\u2019s mTLS implementation.\n - Offering reliability is \u201ctable stakes\u201d for any service mesh.

It is a CNI plugin that offers layer 7 features typically seen with a service mesh. On this week\u2019s podcast, Thomas Graf (one of the maintainers of Cilium and co-founder of Isovalent) discusses the recent 1.6 release, some of the security questions/concerns around eBPF, and the future roadmap for the project.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n* Cilium brings eBPF to the Cloud Native World. It works across both layer 4 and a layer 7. While it started as a pure eBPF plugin, they discovered that just caring about ports was not enough from a security perspective.\n* Cilium went 1.0 about a year and a half ago. 1.6 is the most featured-packed release of Cilium yet. Today, it has around 100 contributors.\n* While Cilium can make it much easier to manage IPTables, Cilium overlaps with a service mesh in that it can do things like understand application protocols, HTTP routes, or even restrict access to specific tables in data stores.\n* Cilium provides both in kernel and sidecar deployments. For sidecar deployments, it can work with Envoy to switch between kernel space and userspace code. The focus is on flexibility, performance, and low overhead.\n* BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) was initial designed to do filtering on data links. eBPF has the same roots but it\u2019s now used for system call filtering, tracing, sandbox, etc. It\u2019s grown to be a general-purpose programming language to extend the Linux kernel.\n* Cilium has a multi-cluster feature built-in. The 1.6 release can run in a kube-proxy free configuration. It allows fine-grain network policies to run across multiple clusters without the use of IPTables.\n* Cilium offers on-the-wire encryption using in-kernel encryption technology that enables mTLS across all traffic in your service fleet. The encryption is completely transparent to the application.\n* eBPF has been used in all production environments at Facebook since May 2017. It\u2019s been used at places like Netflix, Google, and Reddit. There are a lot of companies who have an interest in eBPF being secure and production-ready, so there\u2019s a lot of attention focused on fixing and resolving and security issues that arise.\n* 1.6 also released KVstore-free operation, socket-based load balancing, CNI chaining, Native AWS ENI mode, enhancements to transparent encryption, and more.\n* The plans for 1.17 is to keep raising up the stack into the socket level (to offer things like load balancing and transparent encryption at scale) and likely offering deeper security features such as process-aware security policies for internal pod traffic.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2HCGnLa\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2HCGnLa",

You can see a macro view of the transaction, and how it interacted with dozens of microservices, while still being able to drill down into the details of one service.\n - If you have only a handful of services, you can probably get away with logging and metrics, but once the complexity increases to dozens, hundreds, or thousands of microservices, you must have tracing.\n - Tracing does not work with a black box approach to the application.

Today on the podcast, she talks about what it takes to develop software that moves in physical space, including the Sense, Think, Act Cycle, the developer experience, and architecture of ROS.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Writing code for robot development, you use the Sense, Think, Act Cycle.\n - ROS is an SDK for robotics. It provides a communication layer that enables data to flow between nodes that handle sensors, logic, and actuation.\n - ROS has two versions and has been around for twelve years. ROS 1 was entirely implemented in C. ROS 2 offers is a common C layer with implementations in many different languages, including Java, JavaScript, and Rust.\n - Released on a six-month cadence, Dashing was the latest release (May 2019). Previous releases were supported for one year, Dashing is the first LTS and will be supported for two years.\n - ROS 2 builds on top of the standard Data Distribution Service (DDS) that you find in mission-critical systems like nuclear power and airplanes.\n - Simulation is an important step in robotics. It allows you to prototype a system before deploying to a physical system.\n - Rviz is a three-dimensional visualizer used to visualize robots, the environments they work in, and sensor data. It is a highly configurable tool, with many different types of visualizations and plugins. It allows you to put together all your data in one place and see it.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2ZbOvrO\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2ZbOvrO",

Today on the podcast, she talks about what it takes to develop software that moves in physical space, including the Sense, Think, Act Cycle, the developer experience, and architecture of ROS.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Writing code for robot development, you use the Sense, Think, Act Cycle.\n - ROS is an SDK for robotics. It provides a communication layer that enables data to flow between nodes that handle sensors, logic, and actuation.\n - ROS has two versions and has been around for twelve years. ROS 1 was entirely implemented in C. ROS 2 offers is a common C layer with implementations in many different languages, including Java, JavaScript, and Rust.\n - Released on a six-month cadence, Dashing was the latest release (May 2019). Previous releases were supported for one year, Dashing is the first LTS and will be supported for two years.\n - ROS 2 builds on top of the standard Data Distribution Service (DDS) that you find in mission-critical systems like nuclear power and airplanes.\n - Simulation is an important step in robotics. It allows you to prototype a system before deploying to a physical system.\n - Rviz is a three-dimensional visualizer used to visualize robots, the environments they work in, and sensor data. It is a highly configurable tool, with many different types of visualizations and plugins. It allows you to put together all your data in one place and see it.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2ZbOvrO\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2ZbOvrO",

We also explore the larger topic of cloud natives platforms, and discuss the tradeoffs between using a simple and opinionated platform against something that is bespoke and more configurable, but also more complex. Related to this, Matt shares his thoughts on when and how to make the decision within an organisation to embrace technology like container orchestration and service meshes.\n\nFinally, we explore the creation of the new Envoy Mobile project. The goal of this project is to expand the capabilities provided by Envoy all the way out to mobile devices powered by Android and iOS. For example, most current user-focused traffic shifting that is conducted at the edge is implemented with coarse-grained approaches via by BGP and DNS, and using something like Envoy within mobile app networking stacks should allow finer-grained control.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n- The Envoy Proxy community has grown from strength-to-strength over the last year, from the inaugural EnvoyCon that ran alongside KubeCon NA 2018, to the increasing number of code contributions from engineers working across the industry\n - Attempting to create a community-driven \u201cuniversal proxy data plane\u201d with clearly defined APIs, like Envoy\u2019s XDS API, has allowed vendors to collaborate on a shared abstraction while still allowing room for \u201cdifferentiated success\u201d to be built on top of this standard\nGoogle\u2019s gRPC framework is adopting the Envoy XDS APIs, as this will allow both Envoy and gRPC instances to be operated via a single control plane, for example, Google Cloud Platform\u2019s Traffic Director service.\n - There is a tendency within the software development industry to fetishise architectures that are designed and implemented by the unicorn tech companies, but not every organisation operates at this scale.\n - However, there has also been industry pushback against the complexity that modern platform components like container orchestration and service meshes can introduce to a technology stack.     - Using a platform within these components provides the best return on investment when an organisation\u2019s software architecture and development teams have reached a certain size.\n - Function-as-a-Service (Faas)-type platforms will most likely be how engineers will interact with software in the future. Business-focused developers often do not want to interact with the platform plumbing\nEnvoy Mobile is building on prior art, and aims to expand the capabilities provided by Envoy all the way out to mobile devices using Android and iOS. Most current end user traffic shifting is implemented with coarse-grained approaches via BGP and DNS, and using something like Envoy instead will allow finer-grained control.\n - Using Envoy Mobile in combination with Protocol Buffers 3, which supports annotations on APIs, can facilitate working with APIs offline, configuring caching, and handling poor networking conditions. One of the motivations for this work is that small increases in application response times can lead to better business outcomes.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/33nlGMu\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/33nlGMu",

We also cover the challenges of supporting teams when they are looking to embrace new modes of working with dynamic infrastructure, and Armon introduces the new learn.hashicorp.com educational website and accompanying community and support forums.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n- There is a lot of fundamental computer science research that underpins the HashiCorp infrastructure workflow and configuration tooling. This helps to ensure that these mission-critical tools perform as expected, and enables sound reasoning about scaling these technologies.\n- The HashiCorp founders recognised the value of creating an industrial research-focused department within the company even when there were only 30 staff.\n- The Consul service mesh and distributed key value store leverages consensus and gossip algorithms from computer science research, Raft and SWIM, respectively. The HashiCorp team contributed a novel research-based improvement to SWIM -- Lifeguard: SWIM-ing with Situational Awareness -- that was presented at the DSN academic conference\n- Initially HashiCorp produced a new tool every 6-12 months, focusing on filling gaps within the infrastructure workflow tooling market. Now the focus is on refining the operator/user experience of the existing tools, creating more integrations with other platforms and tooling, and facilitating engineering teams adopting these tools, via the creation of educational resources and community forums.\n- Standardisation within computing technology can offer many benefits, especially where interoperability is required or technology switching costs are high. Care must be taken to ensure the correct interfaces are created, and that the time is right to create appropriate abstractions.\n- The HashiCorp team are focusing on \"marching up the stack\", with the goal that a lot of the underlying \"plumbing\" should be hidden from, or easily configurable by, application developers.

                "summary": "On this podcast, we\u2019re talking to Armon Dadgar, co-founder and CTO of HashiCorp. Alongside Mitchell Hashimoto, Armon founded HashiCorp over six years ago, and the company has gone from strength to strength, with their open source infrastructure product suite now consisting of Consul, Nomad, Vault and Terraform.\n\nWe discuss the formation of the HashiCorp research division, and explore some of the computer science research underpinning Consul and Nomad. We also cover the challenges of supporting teams when they are looking to embrace new modes of working with dynamic infrastructure, and Armon introduces the new learn.hashicorp.com educational website and accompanying community and support forums.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n- There is a lot of fundamental computer science research that underpins the HashiCorp infrastructure workflow and configuration tooling. This helps to ensure that these mission-critical tools perform as expected, and enables sound reasoning about scaling these technologies.\n- The HashiCorp founders recognised the value of creating an industrial research-focused department within the company even when there were only 30 staff.\n- The Consul service mesh and distributed key value store leverages consensus and gossip algorithms from computer science research, Raft and SWIM, respectively. The HashiCorp team contributed a novel research-based improvement to SWIM -- Lifeguard: SWIM-ing with Situational Awareness -- that was presented at the DSN academic conference\n- Initially HashiCorp produced a new tool every 6-12 months, focusing on filling gaps within the infrastructure workflow tooling market. Now the focus is on refining the operator/user experience of the existing tools, creating more integrations with other platforms and tooling, and facilitating engineering teams adopting these tools, via the creation of educational resources and community forums.\n- Standardisation within computing technology can offer many benefits, especially where interoperability is required or technology switching costs are high. Care must be taken to ensure the correct interfaces are created, and that the time is right to create appropriate abstractions.\n- The HashiCorp team are focusing on \"marching up the stack\", with the goal that a lot of the underlying \"plumbing\" should be hidden from, or easily configurable by, application developers. This will allow developers to focus on adding value related to their business or organisation, rather than getting stuck with managing infrastructure.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2KptB3d\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2KptB3d"

            "content": "On this podcast, Wes talks to John Xmas. Johnny works for Kasada, a company that offers a security platform to help ensure only your users are logging into your web applications. Johnny is a well-known figure in the security space. The two discuss common attack vectors, the OWASP Top 10, and then walk through what hackers commonly do attempting to compromise a system. The show is full of advice on protecting your systems including topics around Defense in Depth, Time-Based Security, two-factor authentication, logging/alerting, security layers, and much more.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - While there are sophisticated web attacks out there that use things like PhantomJS or Headless Chome, the vast majority of the web application attacks are the same unsophisticated scripted attacks that you always hear about. These are simple scripts using tools like curl and BurpSuite with Python or JavaScript. These simple scripts are still incredibly effective.\n - OWASP Top 10 really hasn\u2019t changed all that much in the last ten years. For example, despite being the number one approach used to educate defensive engineers on how to protect their apps, SQLI (SQL Injection) is still the most common attack. We continue to repeat the same mistakes that have exposed systems for a decade now.\n - Phishing is by and far the quickest way to compromise a system. Defensive in Depth, security boundaries, limiting local admin rights are all things that corporations can implement to minimize the blast radius.\n - Attackers have hundreds of gigs of actual username/password combinations that have been exposed from all the breaches over the past few years. These are often a first step when attempting to compromise a system. It\u2019s more often likely that they will figure out a valid email pattern for a company and then feed actual names into that pattern to go after the username. From there, brute force attacks with those usernames against libraries of passwords is a common approach.\n - A common approach is to go after an email login. While the email can be a treasure trove of information, it\u2019s more about using those credentials in other places. It\u2019s pretty common, for example, to use those credentials to get into a network with a VPN.\n - Captcha/reCaptcha is not very effective and preventing these brute force attacks. There are a large number of bypasses and even Mechanical Turk companies that are available to bypass these tools. What can be effective is Time Based Security because it slows the attackers down. If you can slow them down, you can make the attack say long to succeed that they\u2019ll go somewhere else.\n - Once inside the network, most companies often have little security on internal systems. Multi-factor authentication, not just on the front door, but on internal systems is a huge step in the right direction. Monitoring not only for failed login attempts but, in some situations, valid login attempts (such as when a domain admin logs into a domain controller) should absolutely be used.\n - When it comes to application security between services within a network, the best advice is to make sure developers really understand what is trying to be accomplished by something like JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Often its the lack of understanding of what they\u2019re actually doing that leads to system vulnerabilities.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2MSIAXG\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2MSIAXG",

The show is full of advice on protecting your systems including topics around Defense in Depth, Time-Based Security, two-factor authentication, logging/alerting, security layers, and much more.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - While there are sophisticated web attacks out there that use things like PhantomJS or Headless Chome, the vast majority of the web application attacks are the same unsophisticated scripted attacks that you always hear about. These are simple scripts using tools like curl and BurpSuite with Python or JavaScript. These simple scripts are still incredibly effective.\n - OWASP Top 10 really hasn\u2019t changed all that much in the last ten years. For example, despite being the number one approach used to educate defensive engineers on how to protect their apps, SQLI (SQL Injection) is still the most common attack. We continue to repeat the same mistakes that have exposed systems for a decade now.\n - Phishing is by and far the quickest way to compromise a system. Defensive in Depth, security boundaries, limiting local admin rights are all things that corporations can implement to minimize the blast radius.\n - Attackers have hundreds of gigs of actual username/password combinations that have been exposed from all the breaches over the past few years. These are often a first step when attempting to compromise a system. It\u2019s more often likely that they will figure out a valid email pattern for a company and then feed actual names into that pattern to go after the username. From there, brute force attacks with those usernames against libraries of passwords is a common approach.\n - A common approach is to go after an email login. While the email can be a treasure trove of information, it\u2019s more about using those credentials in other places. It\u2019s pretty common, for example, to use those credentials to get into a network with a VPN.\n - Captcha/reCaptcha is not very effective and preventing these brute force attacks. There are a large number of bypasses and even Mechanical Turk companies that are available to bypass these tools. What can be effective is Time Based Security because it slows the attackers down. If you can slow them down, you can make the attack say long to succeed that they\u2019ll go somewhere else.\n - Once inside the network, most companies often have little security on internal systems. Multi-factor authentication, not just on the front door, but on internal systems is a huge step in the right direction. Monitoring not only for failed login attempts but, in some situations, valid login attempts (such as when a domain admin logs into a domain controller) should absolutely be used.\n - When it comes to application security between services within a network, the best advice is to make sure developers really understand what is trying to be accomplished by something like JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Often its the lack of understanding of what they\u2019re actually doing that leads to system vulnerabilities.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2MSIAXG\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2MSIAXG",

The Eclipse Foundation was chosen to govern the evolution of Oracle\u2019s Java EE to Jakarta EE. The two discuss the project, the recent news about issues with the javax namespace, the challenges around bundling a Java Runtime with Eclipse, and the path forward for Jakarta EE 9 and beyond.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Java EE, unlikely Java SE, has always been a multi-vendor ecosystem. It made sense for everyone for Oracle to invite their partners to be involved in the governance of the specification for Java EE for it to continue moving forward. This is the reason for moving Java EE into the Eclipse Foundation as Jakarta EE.\n - The current plan is for the Eclipse Foundation to get a copyright license to evolve the text of the specification and not a license to the trademarks of Java EE itself.\n - The javax namespace must remain as is. For it to be evolved, a different namespace must be used.\nThe javax namespace is a trademark of Oracle. Because of this, there are quality controls that Oracle required for its evolution. Ultimately because of those controls, the Eclipse Foundation felt it was better to branch javax into a different namespace and evolve it separately solely under Jakarta EE governance.\n - Jakarta EE 8 is targeted to be released around Oracle Code ONE. Jakarta EE 8 will be exactly the same as Java EE 8. * The only difference is it will be licensed from Jakarta, not Oracle and only requires membership in the Working Group.\n - Beyond EE 8, the release cycle, the plan for moving the javax namespace (and keeping compatibility with both the old javax namespace and the new namespace), and new specifications for inclusion into Jakarta EE are still active areas of discussion.\n - Unrelated to the discussion of Jakarta EE (but discussed in the same board meeting), an attempt to bundle OpenJ9 with the Eclipse IDE failed because of licensing restrictions around a certified Java Runtime. OpenJ9 is certified when acquired through an IBM channel, but not when downloaded directly for us.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2HSfcfM\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2HSfcfM",

                "summary": "Ludwig is a code-free deep learning toolbox originally created and open sourced by UberAI. Today, on the podcast the creator of Ludwig Piero Molino and Wes Reisz discuss the project. The two talk about how the project works, its strengths, it\u2019s roadmap, and how it\u2019s being used by companies inside (and outside) of Uber. They wrap by discussing path ahead for Ludwig and how you can get involved with the project.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n\u2022 Uber AI is the research and platform team for everything AI at the company with the exception of self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are left to Uber ATG.\n\u2022 Ludwig allows you to specify a Tensorflow model in a declarative format that focuses on your inputs and outputs. Ludwig then builds a model that can deal with those types of inputs and outputs without a developer explicitly specifying how that is done.\n\u2022 Because of Ludwig\u2019s datatype abstraction for inputs and outputs, there is a huge range of applications that can be created. For example, an input could be text and output could be a category. In this case, Ludwig will create a text classifier. An image and text input (such as a question: \u201cIs there a dog in this image\u201d) would output a question answering system. There are many combinations that are possible with Ludwig.\n\u2022 Uber is using Ludwig for text classification for customer support.\n\u2022 Datatypes can be extended easily with Ludwig for custom use cases.\n\u2022 Ludwig would love to have people contribute to the project.

On the podcast today, Ben discusses with Wes observability, and his thoughts on logging, metrics, and tracing. The two discuss detection and refinement as the real problem when it comes to diagnosing and troubleshooting incidents with data. The podcast is full of useful tips on building and implementing an effective observability strategy.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - If you\u2019re getting woke up for an alert, it should actually be an emergency. When that happens, things to think about include: when did this happen, how quickly is it changing, how did it change, and what things in my entire system are correlated with that change.\n - A reality that seems to be happening in our industry is that we\u2019re coupling the move to microservices with a move to allowing teams to fully self-determine technology stacks. This is dangerous because we\u2019re not at the stage where all languages/tools/frameworks are equivalent.\n - While a service mesh offers a great potential for integrations at layer 7 many people have unrealistic expectations on how much observability will be enabled by a service mesh. The service mesh does a great job of showing you the communication between the services, but often the details get lost in the work that\u2019s being done inside the service. Service owners need to still do much more work to instrument applications.\n - Too many people focus on the 3 Pillars of Observability. While logs, metrics, and tracing are important, observability strategy ought to be more focused on the core workflows and needs around detection and refinement.\n - Logging about individual transactions is better done with tracing. It\u2019s unaffordable at scale to do otherwise.\n - Just like logging, metrics about individual transactions are less valuable. Application level metrics such as how long a queue is are metrics that are truly useful.\n - The problem with metrics are the only tools you have in a metrics system to explain the variations that you\u2019re seeing is grouping by tags. The tags you want to group by have high cardinality, so you can\u2019t group them. You end up in a catch 22.\n - Tracing is about taking traces and doing something useful with them. If you look at hundreds or thousands of tracing, you can answer really important questions about what\u2019s changing in terms of workloads and dependencies about a system with evidence.\n - When it comes to serverless, tracing is more important than ever because everything is so ephemeral. Node is one of the most popular serverless languages/frameworks and, unfortunately, also one of the hardest of all to trace.\n - The most important thing is to make sure that you choose something portable for the actual instrumentation piece of a distributed tracing system. You don\u2019t want to go back and rip out the instrumentation because you want to switch vendors. This is becoming conventional wisdom.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2PPIdeE\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2PPIdeE",

Fastly recently released a pure Web Assembly runtime for their edge that is built on top of Wasi called Lucet (allows access to lower level things at the edge like sockets and UDP).\n - Zoom has a web client written in Web Assembly.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2Dw3jcH\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2Dw3jcH"

Today on the podcast, Bryan discusses with Wes Reisz a bit about the origins of DTrace and then spends the rest of the time discussing why he feels Rust is the \u201cbiggest development in systems development in his career.\u201d The podcast wraps with a bit about why Bryan feels we should be rewriting parts of the operating system in Rust.\n\nWhy listen to the podcast:\n\n\u2022 DTrace came down to a desire to use Dynamic Program Text Modification to instrument running systems (much like debuggers do) and has its origins to when Bryan was an undergraduate.\n\u2022 When a programming language delivers something to you, it takes it from you in the runtime. The classic example of this is garbage collection. The programming language gives you the ability to use memory dynamically without thinking of how the memory is stored in the system, but then it\u2019s going to exact a runtime cost.\n\u2022 One of the issues with C is that it just doesn\u2019t compose well. You can\u2019t just necessarily pull a library off the Internet and use it well. Everyone\u2019s C is laden with some many idiosyncrasies on how it\u2019s used and the contract on how memory is used.\n\u2022 Ownership is statically tracking who owns the structure. It\u2019s ownership and the absence of GC that allows you to address the composability issues found in C.\n\u2022 It\u2019s really easy in C to have integer overflow which leads to memory safety issues that can be exploited by an attacker. Rust makes this pretty much impossible because it\u2019s very good at how it determines how you use signed vs unsigned types.\n\u2022 You don\u2019t want people solving the same problems over and over again. You want composability. You want abstractions. What you don\u2019t want is where you\u2019ve removed so much developer friction that you develop code that is riddled with problems. For example, it slows a developer down to force them to run a linter, but it results in better artifacts. Rust effective builds a lot of that linter checking into the memory management/type checking system.\n\u2022 While there\u2019s some learning curve to Rust. It\u2019s not that bad if you realize there are several core concepts you need to understand to understand Rust. Rust is one of those languages that you really need to learn in a structured way. Sit down with a book and learn it.\n\u2022 Rust struggles when you have objects that are multiply owned (such as a Doubly Linked List). It\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t know who owns what. While Rust supports unsafe operations, you should resist the temptation to develop with a lot of unsafe operations if you want the benefits of what Rust offers developers.\n\u2022 Firmware is a great spot for growing Rust development in a process of replacing bits of what we think of as the operating system.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2uZ5QHZ\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2uZ5QHZ",

He talks a bit about what he liked (and didn\u2019t like) about each. Finally, the two wrap by discussing Atomist and how they\u2019re trying to change the idea of software delivery from a statically defined pipeline (located in individual repositories) to an event hub that drives a series of actions for software delivery.

It was through that process that Rod Johnson found he felt there was a better way and ultimately lead to the creation of the Spring Framework.\n - What started as examples and references, became the Spring Framework. By 2005 there were about 2 million downloads of the Spring Framework.\nAfter leaving VMWare in 2013, Rod spent several years working with Scala. One of the elegant features that really attracted Rod to Scala was how everything is an expression. One of the things he didn\u2019t like was an affinity to overly complex approaches to problem solving.\n - Today at Atomist, Rod does a lot of work in Node. He really enjoys the robust extra layer of typing over a dynamic language and the ability to escape to JavaScript if needed (similar to escaping types with reflection in Java found in the internals of the Spring Framework).\n - Atomist, the company he founded after leaving VMWare, is rethinking CI/CD from a static pipeline defined in every repository to an event-driven system that defines how to respond to specific events (such as a push from Git). For example, all pushes with Spring Boot can be configured to be scanned with SonarQube or because a push has kubespec it might get deployed to a K8 cluster.

Grady is well known as the co-creator of UML, an original member of the design patterns movement, and now work he\u2019s doing around Artificial Intelligence. On the podcast today, the two discuss what today\u2019s reality is for AI. Grady answers questions like what does an AI mean to the practice of writing software and around how he seems it impact delivering software. In addition, Grady talks about AI surges (and winters) of over the years, the importance of ethics in software, and host of other related questions.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - There have been prior ages of AI that has lead to immediate winters of where reality set in. It stands to reason, there will be a version of an AI winter that follows today\u2019s excitement around deep learning.\n\n - AIs are beginning to look at the code for testing edge cases in software and do things such as looking over your shoulder and identifying patterns in the code that you write.\n\n - AIs will remove tedium for software developers; however, software developer is (and will remain) a labor-intensive activity for decades to come.nAI is another bag of tools in a larger systems activity.\n\n - Much of the AI developers are young white men from the United States. That has a number of inherent biases in this fact. There are several organizations that are focused on combating some of these biases and bringing ethical learning into the field. This is important for us to be aware of and encourage.\n\n - The traditional techniques of systems engineering we know for building non-AI systems will still apply. AI\u2019s are pieces of larger systems. That might be really interesting parts, but it\u2019s just a part of a larger system that requires a lot of non-AI engineering use cases.\n\n - Early machine learning systems were mostly learn and forget systems. You teach them, you deploy them, and you walk away. Today, we do continuous learning and we need to integrate these new models into the delivery pipeline.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2SjJOsq\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2SjJOsq",

It stands to reason, there will be a version of an AI winter that follows today\u2019s excitement around deep learning.\n\n - AIs are beginning to look at the code for testing edge cases in software and do things such as looking over your shoulder and identifying patterns in the code that you write.\n\n - AIs will remove tedium for software developers; however, software developer is (and will remain) a labor-intensive activity for decades to come.nAI is another bag of tools in a larger systems activity.\n\n - Much of the AI developers are young white men from the United States. That has a number of inherent biases in this fact. There are several organizations that are focused on combating some of these biases and bringing ethical learning into the field. This is important for us to be aware of and encourage.\n\n - The traditional techniques of systems engineering we know for building non-AI systems will still apply. AI\u2019s are pieces of larger systems. That might be really interesting parts, but it\u2019s just a part of a larger system that requires a lot of non-AI engineering use cases.\n\n - Early machine learning systems were mostly learn and forget systems. You teach them, you deploy them, and you walk away. Today, we do continuous learning and we need to integrate these new models into the delivery pipeline.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2SjJOsq\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2SjJOsq",

Today on the show, the two discuss the recent purchase of Heptio by VMWare, the Kubernetes Privilege Escalation Flaw (and the response to it), Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals, the CNCF/organization of Kubernetes, and some of the future hopes for the platform.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Heptio, the company Joe and Craig McLuckie co-founded, viewed themselves as not a Kubernetes company, but more of a cloud native company. Joining VMWare allowed the company to continue a mission of helping people decouple \u201cmoving to cloud/taking advantage of cloud\u201d patterns (regardless of where you\u2019re running).\n\n - Re:Invent 2017 when EKS was announced was a watershed moment for Kubernetes. It marked a time where enough customers were asking for Kubernetes that the major cloud providers started to offer first-class support.\n\n - Kubernetes 1.13 included a patch for the Kubernetes Privilege Escalation Flaw Patch. While the flaw was a bad thing, it demonstrated product maturity in the way the community-based security response.\n\n - Kubernetes has an idea of committees, sigs, and working groups. Security is one of the committees. There were a small group of people who coordinated the security response. From there, trusted sets of vendors validated and test patches. Most of the response is based on how many other open source projects handle security response.\n\n - Over the last couple of releases, Kubernetes has introduced a Sig Architecture special interest group. It\u2019s an overarching review for changes that sweep across Kubernetes. As part of Sig Architecture, the Kubernetes community has introduced Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal process (or KEPs). It\u2019s a way for people to propose architectural changes to Kubernetes.\n\n - The goal of the CNCF is to curate and provide support to a set of projects (of which Kubernetes is one). The TOC (Technical Oversight Committee) decides which projects are going to be part of the CNCF and how those projects are supported.\n\n - Kubernetes was always viewed by the creators as something to be build on.

                "summary": "Today on the InfoQ Podcast, Wes speaks with ThirdLove\u2019s Megan Cartwright. Megan is the Director of Data Science for the personalized bra company. In the podcast, Megan first discusses why their customers need a more personal experience and how their using technology to help. She focuses quite a bit of time in the podcast discussing how the team got to an early MVP and then how they did the same for getting to an early machine learning MVP for product recommendations. In this later part, she discusses decisions they made on what data to use, how to get the solution into production quickly, how to update/train new models, and where they needed help. It\u2019s a real early stage startup story of a lean team leveraging machine learning to get to a practical recommendations solution in a very short timeframe.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - The experience for women selecting bras is poor experience characterized by awkward fitting experiences and an often uncomfortable product that may not even fit correctly. ThirdLove is a company built to serve this market.\n - ThirdLove took a lean approach to develop their architecture. It\u2019s built with the Parse backend. The leveraged Shopify to build the site. The company\u2019s first recommender system used a rules engine embedded into the front end. After that, they moved to a machine learning MVP with a Python recommender service that used a Random Forest algorithm in SciKit-Learn. \n - Despite having the data for 10 million surveys, the first algorithms only need about 100K records to be trained. The takeaway is you don\u2019t have to have huge amounts of data to get started with machine learning.\n - To initially deploy their ML solution, ThirdLove first shadowed all traffic through the algorithm and then compared it to what was being output by the rules engine. Using this along with information on the full customer order lifecycle, they validated the ML solution worked correctly and outperformed the rules engine.\n - ThirdLove\u2019s machine learning story shows that you move towards a machine learning solution quickly by leveraging your own network and using tools that may already familiar to your team.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2G9RnQn\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2G9RnQn"

On today\u2019s podcast, Wes talks with Lynn about a concept she calls 25% time and a project it led her to become involved within genomic research. 25% time is her own method of learning while collaborating with someone else for a greater good. A recent project leads her to become involved with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. Through cloud adoption and some lean startup practices, they were able to drop the run time for a machine learning algorithm against a genomic dataset from 500 hours to 10 minutes.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - 25% time is a way to learn, study, or collaborate with someone else for a greater good. It\u2019s unbilled time in the service of offers. Using the idea of 25% time along with some personal events that occurred in her life, Lynn became involved with genomic researchers in Australia.\n - Price of genomic sequencing has dropped. The price drop has enabled researchers to create huge repositories of genomic data; however, it was mostly on-prem. The idea of building data pipelines was pretty new in the genome community. Additionally, the genome itself is 3 billion data points. A variant of as little at 10-15 variants can be statistically significant.\n - The challenge was to leverage cloud resources. To gain a quick win and buy-in for Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (or CSIRO an independent Australian federal government agency) for cloud adoption, a first step was to capture interest in the idea. So the team stored their reference data in the cloud and enabled access via a Jupyter Notebook.\n - They demonstrated a use case against the genomic data set leveraging a synthetic phenotype (or a fake disease) called hipsterdom. The solution became a basis for global discussion that got more people involved in the community.\n - By leveraging cloud resources, the CSIRO was able to get a run their dataset that took 500 hours against an on-prem Spark cluster to 10 minutes.\n - Learning new programming language has unseen benefits. For example, Ballerina (a language written as an integration language between APIs) interested Lynn because of its live visual diagrams; however, benefited her with some of the cloud pipelines because of its ability to produce YAML files.\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2T2LZBQ",

Tanya discusses her research into how the fire code evolved in New York and draws on some of the parallels she sees in software. Along the way, she discusses what it means to be an SRE, what effective aspects of the role might look like, and her opinions on what we as an industry should be doing to prevent disasters. This podcast features discussion on paved roads, prevention, testing, firefighting (in software), and reliability questions to ask throughout the software lifecycle.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n- Teams increasingly   are responsible for the entire software lifecycle. When this happens, they think about the software differently because they know their the ones that will get paged if it fails. This idea is at the core of the \u201cYou Build It, You Run It\u201d philosophy in DevOps.\n- The role of SRE is to define how to do things in a really reliable way. The focus is to make the majority of the operations work go away, and, for the things that can\u2019t go away, it\u2019s as easy as possible.\n- At the very start of a project (when you\u2019re writing the initial design), you should be thinking about the dependencies for a system and how will those that follow with be able to determine that. A great way to do this is to offer an API that people will want to use and then instrument it.\n- We can learn a lot from the growth of fire safety regulations as metaphors for software, including: fireproof interior walls, socializing best practices, software inspections, and circuit breakers are all examples.\n- The work SREs do varies in many places. SREs range from making recommendations on patterns to library creators in other areas. Occasionally, SREs are firefighters of last resort. In these cases, they\u2019re the last resort though.\n- We use error budgets and SLOs to quantify how many much risk we\u2019re comfortable taking. It\u2019s used to inform how much less (or more risk) we\u2019re willing to take on.\n- We need to consider software reliability throughout the full cycle of software development.

In addition to discussing Refactors, Martin and Wes discuss his thoughts on evolutionary architecture, team structures, and how the idea of refactors can be applied in larger architecture contexts.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n -    Refactoring is the idea of trying to identify the sequence of small steps that allows you to make a big change. That core idea hasn\u2019t changed.\n - Several new refactorings in the book deal with the idea of transforming data structures into other data structures, Combine Functions into Transform for example.\n - Several of the refactorings were removed or not added to the book in favor of adding them to a web edition of the book.\n - A lot of the early refactorings are like cleaning the dirt off the glass of a window. You just need them to be able to see where the hell you are and then you can start looking at the broader ones.\n - Refactorings can be applied broadly to architecture evolution. Two recent posts How to break a Monolith into Microservices, by Zhamak Dehghani,  and How to extract a data-rich service from a monolith by Praful Todkar on MartinFowler.com deal with this specifically.\n - Evolutionary architecture is a broad principle that architecture is constantly changing.

The release expanded Consul\u2019s capability around service segmentation (controlling who and how services connect East and West). On this week\u2019s podcast, Wes and Mitchell discuss Consul in detail. The two discuss Consul\u2019s design decisions around focusing on user space networking, layer 4 routing, Go, Windows\u2019 performance characteristics, the roadmap for eBPF on Linux, and an interesting feature that Consul implements called Network Tomography. The show wraps with Mitchell\u2019s discussion on some of the research that Hashicorp is doing around machine learning and security with Consul.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n- Consul is first and foremost a centralized service registry that provides discovery. While it has a key-value store, it is Consul\u2019s least important feature.\nWith the June release (1.2), Consul entered more into the space of a service mesh with the focus on service segmentation (controlling how you connect and who can connect).\n- Hashicorp attempts to limit the language fragmentation in the Company and has seen a lot of success leveraging Go across their platforms. Therefore, Consul is written in Go.\n- Because Consul focused on layer 4 first, it is recommended to leverage the recent integration with Envoy for achieving high degrees of observability.\n- All of the network routing with Consul happens in user space at this point; however, kernel space routing with eBPF is planned for the near term. The focus, at this point, is safely cross-compiling to every platform and addressing the most possible use cases. The focuses isn\u2019t on the high performance use cases (yet).\n- For any two servers across the globe in different data centers, instantly Consul can give you 99th percentile round-trip time between with uses a feature called Network Tomography.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2S3ZiSx\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2S3ZiSx",

One thing about relationships is that they tend to be better when you have one on one conversations with people on our regular basis.  A lot of the value of one on one meeting is that you are reenforcing the social connection you have with the other person.\n - One of the most important things we do as engineering managers is stay abreast of how to make teams effective in the context of delivering software.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2RJdwYR\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2RJdwYR"

The podcast wraps up with a discussion around how you get something like this into production.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - A common use case is the ability to search for similar things - I want to find another pair of sunglasses like these, or I want a cat that looks like this picture, or even a tool like Google\u2019s Smart Reply, can all be considered broadly the domain of semantic search.\n\n - For image classification you generally want a convolutional neural network. You typically use a model pre-trained with a public data set like Imagenet pre-trained to generate embeddings, using the pre-trained model up to the penultimate layer, and storing the value of the activations.\n\n - From here the idea is to mix image embeddings with word embeddings.  The embeddings, whether for words or images, are just a vector that represents a thing.  There are many approaches to getting vectors for words, but the one that started it is word2vec.\n\n - For both image embeddings and word embeddings you can typically use pre-trained models, meaning that you only need to train the final step of bringing the two models together.\n\n - Before deploying to production it is important that you validate the model against biases such as sexism, typically using outside people to a carry out a through audit.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2RAEUrV\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2RAEUrV",

It runs on the JVM. There is a port to C#. All code is pushed up stream.\n - The platform uses the actor model and all messages are sent in a type-safe way.\n - Vlingo supports clustering and uses a bully algorithm to achieve consensus.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ https://bit.ly/2MwEWxb\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2MwEWxb",

Yet everything else about software has really changed such as automation, build pipelines, and delivery.\n* XDP (eXpress Data Path) is a packet processing layer for Linux that lets you run fast in kernel compiled safe program in kernel called eBPF. It\u2019s used for things like packet filtering and encapsulation/decapsulation.\n* Cilium is an in-kernel, high performance service mesh that leverages eBPF.

They form a deployment pattern that is a way of decoupling and therefore has no impact on the idea of clean architecture.\n* There is room for \u201ccreature comforts\u201d in a code base that makes for more livable, convenient code.\n* \u201cWe have no ethics that are defined [in software].\u201d If we don\u2019t find a way to police it ourselves, governments will.

While it was originally developed at Lyft (and still drives much of their architecture), it is a fully open source driven project. Matt addresses on this podcast what he sees as the major design goals of Envoy, answers questions about a sidecar performance impact, discusses observability, and thinks out loud on the future of Envoy.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n- Envoy\u2019s goal is to abstract the network from application programmers. It\u2019s really about helping application developers focus on building business logic and not on the application plumbing.\n- Envoy is a large community driven project, not a cohesive product that does one thing. It can be used as a foundational building blocks to extend into a variety of use cases, including as an edge proxy, as a service mesh sidecar, and as a substrate for building new products.\n- While there is performance cost for using sidecar proxies, the rich featureset is often a worthwhile tradeoff. With that said, there is work being done that is greatly improving Envoy\u2019s performance.\n- Envoy is built to run Lyft. There were no features that were in Envoy when it was open sourced that were not used at Lyft.\n- Envoy emits a rich set of logs and has a plugable tracing system. The goal is observability first and one of the main project goals.\n- Lyft deploys Envoy master twice per week.\n- Envoy\u2019s roadmap includes work on automating settings (rate limits and retries), focus on ease of operation (such as where things got routed what the internal timings), and additional protocol support such as Kafka.\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2tmUKMl",

Matt addresses on this podcast what he sees as the major design goals of Envoy, answers questions about a sidecar performance impact, discusses observability, and thinks out loud on the future of Envoy.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n- Envoy\u2019s goal is to abstract the network from application programmers. It\u2019s really about helping application developers focus on building business logic and not on the application plumbing.\n- Envoy is a large community driven project, not a cohesive product that does one thing. It can be used as a foundational building blocks to extend into a variety of use cases, including as an edge proxy, as a service mesh sidecar, and as a substrate for building new products.\n- While there is performance cost for using sidecar proxies, the rich featureset is often a worthwhile tradeoff. With that said, there is work being done that is greatly improving Envoy\u2019s performance.\n- Envoy is built to run Lyft. There were no features that were in Envoy when it was open sourced that were not used at Lyft.\n- Envoy emits a rich set of logs and has a plugable tracing system. The goal is observability first and one of the main project goals.\n- Lyft deploys Envoy master twice per week.\n- Envoy\u2019s roadmap includes work on automating settings (rate limits and retries), focus on ease of operation (such as where things got routed what the internal timings), and additional protocol support such as Kafka.\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2tmUKMl"

Some of the things discussed on the podcast include tips for creating boundaries between serverless and non-serverless resources and how to think of distributed tracing in serverless environments.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n- Coca Cola was able to see a productivity gain of 29% by adopting serverless (as measured by the amount of time spent on business productivity applications).\n- Tooling for serverless is often a challenge because resources are ephemeral. To address the ephemeral nature of serverless, you need to think about what information you will need to log ahead of time.\n- Monitoring should focus on events important to the business.\n- Build barriers between serverless and flat scaling non-serverless resources to prevent issues. Queues are an example of ways to protect flat scaling resources.\n- In-memory caches are a handy way to help serverless functions scale when fronting databases.\n- There are limitations with tracing and profiling on serverless. Several external products are available to help.\n- Serverless (and Microservices) are not for every solution.

Martin is a Java Champion with over 2 decades of experience building complex and high-performance computing systems. He is most recently known for his work on Aeron and Simple Binary Encoding (SBE). Previously at LMAX he was the co-founder and CTO when he created the Disruptor.\u00a0\n* Aeron is a messaging system designed for modern multi-core hardware.  It is highly performant with a first class design goal of making it easy to monitor and understand at runtime.  The product is able to simultaneously achieve the lowest latency and highest throughput of any messaging system available today.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast: \n\n* Aeron uses a binary format on the wire rather than a text based protocol.  This is largely done for performance reasons.  Text is commonly used in messaging to make debugging simpler but the debugging problem can be solved using tools like Wireshark and the dissectors that come with it.\n\n* In a forthcoming release of Aeron will support clustering.  Raft was chosen over PAXOS for this since it is more strict. This means that there are fewer potential states the system can be in making it easier to reason about.\n\n* RAFT is an RPC-based protocol, expecting synchronous interactions.  Aeron is asynchronous by its nature, but the underlying Aeron protocol was designed to support consensus, meaning that a lot of things which would typically need to be done synchronously can be done asynchronously and/or in parallel.  \n\n* Static clusters will be added first to Aeron, with dynamic clustering after that, and then cryptography again with the intention of keeping the latency and throughput high.

In this podcast, Danny discusses everything from the scale Uber operates at to what the major steps for training/deploy models in an iterative (almost Darwinistic) fashion and wraps with his advice for software engineers who want to begin applying machine learning into their day-to-day job.  \n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n* Uber processes 850,000 - 1.3 million messages per second in their streaming platform with about 12 TB of growth per day. The system\u2019s queries scan 100 million to 4 billion documents per second.\n* Uber\u2019s frontend is mobile. The frontend talks to an API layer. All services generate events that are shuffled into Kafka. The real-time forecasting pipeline taps into Kafka to processes events and stores the data into Elasticsearch. * There is a federated query layer in front of Elasticsearch to provide OLAP query capabilities.\n* Apache Flink\u2019s advanced windowing features, programming model, and checkpointing convinced Uber to move away from the simplicity of Apache Samza.\n* The forecasting system allows Uber to remove the notion of delay by using recent signals plus historical data to project what is happening now and what will happen into the future.\n* Uber\u2019s pipeline for deploying ML models: HDFS, feature engineering, organizing into data structures (similar to data frames), deploy mostly offline training models, train models, & store into a container-based model manager. \n* A model serving layer is used to pick which model to use, forecasting results are stored in an OLAP data store, a validation layer compares real results against forecast results to verify the model is working as desired, and a rollback feature enables poor performing models to be automatically replaced by previous one.\n* \u201cWithout output, you don\u2019t have input.\u201d If you want to start leveraging machine learning, developers just need to start doing.

Additionally, as Java 10 was recently released a short bit at the end was added to discuss some of the latest news with Java.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n\u2022 People quickly moved to Java 8 because of features like Streams and Lambdas. Java 9 has a different story around modularity and application architecture. Adoption is slower and more intentional.\n\u2022 Migrating large codebases to use modularity is hard. Many of the projects using modules are greenfield, and those large codebases that are moving now are most often using the classpath.\n\u2022 Jlink is a new command line tool released with Java 9. It allows developers to create their own lightweight, customized JRE for a module-based Java application.\n\u2022 Java version scheme has dropped the 1.* prefix. Future releases of the JDK will have the version number and follow the form *.0.1 (i.e. 9.0.1)\n\u2022 While the module system will likely show it\u2019s benefit mostly for new development, many 3rd party libraries are moving to adopt modularity and removing their dependencies on JDK internal APIs. It\u2019s improving the experience for teams adopting modularity.\n\u2022 There are no known open JEPS regarding the enhancement of the Java module system.\n\u2022 Java 10 has been released.

Theo says, \"it's not about the absence of evil, it's about the presence of good.\" He challenges us to develop rigor around ethical decisions we make in software just as we do for areas like security. With the incredible implications of machine learning and AI in our future, this week's podcast touches on topics we should all consider in the systems we create.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - The ubiquitous society impact of computers is surfacing the need for deeper conversations on software ethics.\n - Ethics are a set of constructs and constraints to help us reason about right and wrong.\n - Algorithmic interpretability of models can be difficult to reason about; however, accountability for algorithms can be enforced in other ways.\n - Questions to be considered when writing software should evolve into: What am I building, why am I building it, and who will it hurt?\n - Ethics in software will take industry reform, deeper conversations, and developing a culture of questioning the software we\u2019re building\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ http://bit.ly/2BZAC4p\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: http://bit.ly/2BZAC4p",

With the incredible implications of machine learning and AI in our future, this week's podcast touches on topics we should all consider in the systems we create.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - The ubiquitous society impact of computers is surfacing the need for deeper conversations on software ethics.\n - Ethics are a set of constructs and constraints to help us reason about right and wrong.\n - Algorithmic interpretability of models can be difficult to reason about; however, accountability for algorithms can be enforced in other ways.\n - Questions to be considered when writing software should evolve into: What am I building, why am I building it, and who will it hurt?\n - Ethics in software will take industry reform, deeper conversations, and developing a culture of questioning the software we\u2019re building\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ http://bit.ly/2BZAC4p\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nCheck the landing page on InfoQ: http://bit.ly/2BZAC4p",

This podcast will cover data streaming and the 2015 DataFlow Model streaming paper [http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1792-Akidau.pdf] and much of the concepts covered, such as why dealing with out-of-order data is important, event time versus processing time, windowing approaches, and finally preview the track he is hosting at QConf SF next week.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Batch processing and streaming aren\u2019t two incompatible things; they are a function of different windowing options.\n - Event time and processing time are two different concepts, and may be out of step with each other.\n - Completeness is knowing that you have processed all the events for a particular window.\n - Windowing choice can be answered from the what, when, where, how questions.\n - Unbounded versus bounded data is a better dimension than stream or batch processing.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ http://bit.ly/2AyBTAb\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nWant to see extented shownotes?

Topics include the differences between a tech lead and an architect, how much documentation is enough and what that looks like in a continuous delivery environment.\n\nWhat you'll learn on this podcast:\n\u2022\tAs an industry we seem to have lost our knowledge of how to do architecture well in the context of modern agile software teams.\n\u2022\tArchitecture is about the expensive decisions; things that are costly to change later.\n\u2022\tIdeally architects should code in the production code base. If you are not able to do this at least be involved in quality reviews and peer reviews in the production code so you can get feedback on your designs.\n\u2022\tIt is often said the the code is the only documentation you need but the code can\u2019t tell you everything. You do need to document the things you can\u2019t get from the code such as the architectural drivers, they key quality attributes and so on along with some high level diagrams and how you operate the system.\n\u2022\tAs you step into the role of architect go and find a mentor or a local meet-up. The major change is that you have to influence and lead people.\n\nThis podcast is sponsored by AppDynamics. Software architects play a critical role in designi\u00ac\u00ac\u00acng, executing, and migrating large infrastructures to the cloud.

            "contentSnippet": "This week's podcast features Simon Brown well known for his work training software architects. Topics include the differences between a tech lead and an architect, how much documentation is enough and what that looks like in a continuous delivery environment.\n\nWhat you'll learn on this podcast:\n\u2022\tAs an industry we seem to have lost our knowledge of how to do architecture well in the context of modern agile software teams.\n\u2022\tArchitecture is about the expensive decisions; things that are costly to change later.\n\u2022\tIdeally architects should code in the production code base. If you are not able to do this at least be involved in quality reviews and peer reviews in the production code so you can get feedback on your designs.\n\u2022\tIt is often said the the code is the only documentation you need but the code can\u2019t tell you everything. You do need to document the things you can\u2019t get from the code such as the architectural drivers, they key quality attributes and so on along with some high level diagrams and how you operate the system.\n\u2022\tAs you step into the role of architect go and find a mentor or a local meet-up. The major change is that you have to influence and lead people.\n\nThis podcast is sponsored by AppDynamics.

The only person you can affect is yourself.\n - A pattern is not a band-aid that you use once. You use it in a context where you use it in conjunctions with other patterns.\n - Take baby steps when driving change in an organisation, and seek out a pocket of receptive people to drive it.\n - Slack is an important part to have in life, so that if something comes along you can absorb it without having to stop doing something else.\n - Listen, Listen, Listen.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ http://bit.ly/2vLIsMC\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nWant to see extented shownotes?

They then discuss how microservices increase the surface area of where sensitive information can be read or manipulated, but also have the potential to create systems that are more secure.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Different organisations have different risk appetites for new technology, so what may be appropriate for one organisation may not be appropriate technology choices for another. \n - If you are deploying micro services then you need to know why you are doing it and what benefits you expect to get from deploying them.\n - Micro services are defined by their independently deployable units rather than their size. \n - Using a cryptographic token that is verifiable off line is a common pattern for passing authentication contexts around to different services.\n - Serverless architectures redeuce the need to monitor server patching but does not diminish the need for monitoring application runtime or library dependencies from security patching.\n\nMore on this: Quick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ http://bit.ly/2v8NJg6\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq\n\nSubscribe: www.youtube.com/infoq\nLike InfoQ on Facebook: bit.ly/2jmlyG8\nFollow on Twitter: twitter.com/InfoQ\nFollow on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/infoq\nWant to see extented shownotes?

It is largely a C++ shop.  There is some Java and Python, and the business logic is all done in PHP.  The iOS apps are written in Objective C and the Android apps are in Java.\n\n - The video infra team at Facebook builds the video infrastructure across the whole company.

Common techniques such as gradient descent and back propagation apply equally well to market analysis.\n- The data sources used are very broad.

Before his workshop on Microservices w/ Spring Boot and Docker at QCon San Francisco 2016, Richardson took time to discuss his ideas on how to use DDD and CQRS concepts as a guide for implementing a robust microservices architecture.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - \"Microservice architecture\" is a better term than \"microservices\".   The latter suggests that a single microservice is somehow interesting\n - The concepts discussed in Domain-Driven Design are an excellent guide for how to implement a microservices architecture\n - Bounded Contexts correspond well to individual microservices\n - Event sourcing and CQRS provide patterns for how to implement loosely coupled services\n - When converting a monolith to microservices, avoid a big bang rewrite, in favor of an iterative approach\n\nNotes and links can be found on: http://bit.ly/2hZ8TM1\n\n11m:51s - Microservices must be loosely coupled, usually creating a model with one database per service.\n12m:45s - There is a business requirement to maintain data consistency across services, and using an event driven architecture is a good way to achieve that.\n13m:38s - Event sourcing is specific technique for persisting domain objects as a series of events.\n14m:11s - Just as transactions don\u2019t like to be split across microservices, queries cannot simply join across multiple data sources.

Start in developemnt and build up.\n- Having failure testing at an application level, as Netflix does, so you can have request level fault injection for a specific user or a specific device. \n- Being able to trace infrastructure with something like Dapper or Zipkin offers tremendous value.

Preslav has been a software engineer at Dropbox for the past three years, contributing to various aspects of Dropbox\u2019s infrastructure including traffic, performance and storage. He was part of the core oncall and storage oncall rotations, dealing with high emergency real world issues, from bad code pushes to complete datacenter outages.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Dropbox migrated away from Amazon S3 to their own data centres to allow them to optimise for their specific use case.\n - They are experimenting with Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) drives for primary storage to increase storage density. All writes go to an SSD cache and then get pushed asynchronously to the SMR disk.\n - Their average block size is 1.6MB with a maximum block size of 4MB. Knowing this allows the team to tune their storage system.\n - Three languages are used for the backend infrastructure. Python is used mainly for business logic, Go is the primary language used for heavy infrastructure services, and in some cases, for example where more direct control over memory is needed, Rust is also used.\n - Dropbox invest very heavily in verification and automation. A verifier scans every byte on disk and checks that it matches the checksum in the index.\n - Verification is also used to check that each box has the block keys it should have.\n\nNotes and links can be found on http://bit.ly/preslav-le\n \nDropbox\u2019s motivation for moving off the cloud \n2:40 - Dropbox used Amazon S3 and other services where it made sense, but they stored all the metadata in their own data centres.\n3:30 - Initially this was done because Amazon had poor support for persistent storage at the time. This has since improved but it didn\u2019t make sense for dropbox to move the metadata back.\n4:01 - By that time the dropbox team was ready to tackle the storage problem and built their own in-house replacement for S3, called Magic Pocket. Magic Pocket allowed Dropbox to move away from Amazon altogether.\n4:30 - The move saved money, but also allowed DropBox to optimise for their specific use case and be faster.\n \nMore on this:\n \nQuick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ. http://bit.ly/preslav-le\n \nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq",

A verifier scans every byte on disk and checks that it matches the checksum in the index.\n - Verification is also used to check that each box has the block keys it should have.\n\nNotes and links can be found on http://bit.ly/preslav-le\n \nDropbox\u2019s motivation for moving off the cloud \n2:40 - Dropbox used Amazon S3 and other services where it made sense, but they stored all the metadata in their own data centres.\n3:30 - Initially this was done because Amazon had poor support for persistent storage at the time. This has since improved but it didn\u2019t make sense for dropbox to move the metadata back.\n4:01 - By that time the dropbox team was ready to tackle the storage problem and built their own in-house replacement for S3, called Magic Pocket. Magic Pocket allowed Dropbox to move away from Amazon altogether.\n4:30 - The move saved money, but also allowed DropBox to optimise for their specific use case and be faster.\n \nMore on this:\n \nQuick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ. http://bit.ly/preslav-le\n \nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq"

Humans are much better with the machines, and the machines are much better with the humans.\n - Stitch Fix has 60 engineers, with 80 data scientists and algorithm developers. This ratio of data science to engineering is unique.\n - With Ruby-on-Rails on top of Postgres, the company maintains about 30 different applications on the same stack.\n - The practice of Test Driven Development makes Continuous Delivery work, and the practice of having the same people build the code as those who operate the code makes both of these things much more powerful.\n - Microservices gives feature velocity, the ability for individual teams to move quickly and independently of each other, and independent deployments.\n - Microservices solve a scaling problem. They solve an organisational scaling problem, and a technological scaling problem. These are not the problems that you have early on in the startup.\n - In the monolithic world, if you're not able to continue to vertically scale the application or the database or whatever your monolith is.

Modern companies combine what machines are really good at, such as chugging through the 60 to 70 questions times the millions of customers, and combining that with the human element of the stylists, figuring out what things go together, what things are trending, what things are appropriate...

The conversation covers how the OverOps product works, explores the difference between instrumentation and observability, discusses bytecode manipulation approaches and common errors in Java based applications.\n\nA keen blogger, Weiss has been designing scalable, real-time Java and C++ applications for the past 15 years. He was co-founder and CEO at VisualTao which was acquired by Autodesk in 2009, and also worked as a software architect at IAI Space Industries focusing on distributed, real-time satellite tracking and control systems.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - OverOps uses a mixture of machine code instrumentation and static code analysis at deployment time to build up an index of the code\n - Observability is how you architect your code to be able to capture information from its outputs. Instrumentation is where you come in from the outside and use bytecode or machine code manipulation techniques to capture information after the system has been designed and built.\n - Bytecode instrumentation is a technique that most companies can benefit from learning a bit more about. Bytecode isn\u2019t machine code - it is a high-level programming language. Being able to read it really helps you understand how the JVM works.\n - There are a number of bytecode manipulation tools you can use to work with bytecode - ASM is probably the most well known.\n - A fairly small number of events within an application\u2019s life-cycle generate the majority of the log volume. A good practice is to regularly review your log files to consider if what is being logged is the right thing.\n\nNotes and links can be found on http://bit.ly/2fInGsW\n\nSaaS vs On-Premise\n\n5:43 - OverOps started as a SaaS product, but given that a lot of the data it collects is potentially sensitive, they introduced a new product called Hybrid. Hybrid separates the data into two independent streams: data and metadata.\n\n6:42 - The data stream is the raw data that is captured which is then privately encrypted using 256 bit AES encryption keys which are only stored on the production machine and by the user when they need to decrypt it. The metadata stream is not sensitive since it is just an abstract mathematical graph.\n\n7:18 - Because the data stream is already privately encrypted, that stream can be stored behind a firewall and never needs to leave a company\u2019s network.\n\nMore on this:\n\nQuick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ. http://bit.ly/2fInGsW\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. bit.ly/24x3IVq",

For example, the data used in predictive policing models is racist. But people tend to be overly trusting of algorithms because they are mathematical.\n - Data scientists have to make ethical decisions even if they don\u2019t acknowledge it.

                "summary": "In this week's podcast, professor Barry Burd talks to Shuman Ghosemajumder. Ghosemajumder is VP of product management at Shape Security and former click fraud czar for Google. Ghosemajumder is also the co-author of the book CGI Programming Unleashed, and was a keynote speaker at QCon New York 2016 presenting Security War Stories.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\nWith more of our lives conducted online through technology and information retrieval systems, the use of advanced technology gives criminals the opportunity to be able to do things that they weren't able to do.\n\n - Cyber-criminals come from all over the world and every socioeconomic background, so long as there's some level of access to computers and technology.\n - You see organised cyber-crime focusing on large companies because of the fact that they get a much greater sense of efficiency for their attacks.\n - Cyber-criminals are getting creative, and coming up with ways to interact with websites we haven't thought of before.\n - You can have very large scale attacks that are completely invisible from the point of view of the application that's being attacked.\n - The context of what are you are using software for is more important than just going through an understanding of the code level vulnerability.\n\nNotes and links can be found on http://bit.ly/2atBFgk\n\nThe People Behind Cyber-Crime\n\n5:28 - There are all kinds of different personalities and demographics involved. Cyber-criminals come from all over the world and every socioeconomic background, so long as there's some level of access to computers and technology. Even in cases where a cyber criminal doesn't know how to use technology directly, or how to create something like a piece of malware, they can still be involved in a cyber-criminal's scheme.\n6:29 - A scheme which uses large groups of individuals and which doesn\u2019t necessarily need to have skills itself, is stealing money from bank accounts. Being able to transfer money using malware on people\u2019s machines from one account to another account that the cyber-criminal controls still involves getting that money out. That last step can involve a set of bank accounts that are assigned to real individuals.\n\nMore on this:\n\nQuick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ. http://bit.ly/2atBFgk\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. http://bit.ly/24x3IVq"

With over ten years of experience in software development, Hemphill has done full stack development for both startup and enterprise companies. Hemphill's presentation at QCon New York was entitled Algorithms for Animation.\n\nWhy listen to this podcast:\n\n - Why developers in startups or enterprise firms should care about creating animations\n - The interfaces we interact with in software are becoming more dynamic\n - If you don't know what's wrong, you don't know how to fix it\n - The most common code smells, according to Llewellyn Falco: Clutter, long lines, long methods, duplication, and inconsistency\n - How do we make- in an agile way- the architectural work visible, and not ignore it?\n - How do you have an incremental architecture and get measurements? If you say you're going to go away for six months and figure it out, that's not very measurable.\n\nNotes and links can be found on InfoQ: http://bit.ly/29kq2ds\n\nWhy Developers Should Care About Creating Animations\n\n1m:05s - The interfaces we interact with in software are becoming more dynamic.\n1m:30s - We are moving closer to natural user interfaces, and this is something software engineers across the board need to consider when they are developing programs. You don't just have a pointer and a mouse and a keyboard- you can squish and stretch things, using your fingers and your hands.\n1m:55s - Animations need to feel real, and that is all based in Math and Physics.\n2m:15s - The animations you see on websites have always been an opportunity for us to have a more fundamental learning about what the program does without needing a lot of instruction.\n2m:38s - Animation functions almost as a way for people to discover and explore an interface so they can interact and engage with it more easily.\n\nThe Importance of Animation Resembling Reality\n\n3m:00s - If you've ever put on an Oculus Rift and experienced \"judder\" and felt immediately sick, that's the most extreme version.\n3m:31s - If a computer is running slowly and you see frames dropped, you are sensing something underlying that is not right, and you immediately distrust it.\n3m:42s - The further away you get from something that is smooth, the more you start to mistrust the platform and the data behind it.\n\nNatural Textures vs Cartoon-Like Textures [...]\n\nQuick scan our curated show notes on InfoQ. http://bit.ly/29kq2ds\n\nYou can also subscribe to the InfoQ newsletter to receive weekly updates on the hottest topics from professional software development. http://bit.ly/24x3IVq"
