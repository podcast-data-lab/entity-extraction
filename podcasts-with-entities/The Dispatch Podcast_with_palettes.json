Just this week, the Trump administration announced that troops\u00a0 in Iraq will be reduced to 3,000. What\u2019s more, peace negotiations are taking place with Taliban representatives, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and representatives of the Afghan government this weekend. So as Steve points out, \u201cYou\u2019d be forgiven for thinking this is all over.\u201d But as Dispatch Podcast guest Tom Joscelyn reminds us on today\u2019s episode, \u201cAl-Qaeda is still very much alive.\u201d Though Tom concedes that there\u2019s a lot you can criticize about U.S. military intervention post-9/11, \u201cIt\u2019s much more common, in my experience, that people who are against the U.S. using military force or U.S. military action to play disconnect the dots than it is for some sort of a so-called hawk to overconnect the dots.\u201d On today\u2019s episode, Tom, Sarah, and Steve discuss American intelligence officials\u2019 current misunderstanding of al-Qaeda, the UAE and Bahrain\u2019s plans to normalize their relationship with Israel, and the real and imagined foreign threats to the upcoming election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-\u201cWhy \u2018Outside-In\u2019 Diplomacy Could Be the Key to Middle East Peace\u201d by Jonathan Schanzer, \u201cThis 9/11 anniversary arrives with the end of the war on al-Qaeda well in sight\u201d by Christopher Miller, director of the National Counterterrorism Center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and \u201cThe Falling Man\u201d by Thomas Junod.\r\n\r\n-Tom Joscelyn\u2019s Vital Interests newsletter for The Dispatch.\r\n\r\n-30-day free trial of The Dispatch"

                "summary": "Last week, President Trump experienced one of the most challenging interviews of his presidency when he sat down with Jonathan Swan from Axios. Swan asked some tough follow-up questions, and Trump\u2019s responses demonstrated that he is not used to this level of pushback. What\u2019s more, the interview highlighted the fact that the White House\u2019s media strategy revolves around reassuring the president rather than getting the facts straight.\r\n\r\nThe gang breaks down the interview and Trump\u2019s answers on the latest podcast.\u00a0 According to Jonah, the videography of the interview was also damning for Trump: \u201cIt was sort of like one of these twenty-something consultants from McKinsey going and interviewing the paper mill owner who still uses the fax machine.\u201d If he knew what he was walking into, why did Trump agree to this interview in the first place? Our hosts have some theories.\r\n\r\nFor weeks, the president has been telling his supporters that mail-in ballots will rig the election in every state except for \u2026 Florida? Trump knows many of his supporters in Florida are elderly Americans who will vote absentee. But as Sarah points out, telling all of his other supporters that mail-in voting is rigged might just work in his favor. Polls show that there will be a partisan divide in this election when it comes to in-person versus mail-in voting, with Democrats more likely to vote by mail. What these polls aren\u2019t telling you is that a not-small percentage of mail-in ballots that are likely to be invalidated for technical reasons, especially given most states are wildly unprepared for the sheer number of mail-in ballots that are coming their way. Whatever happens, the election is going to be ugly. Tune in to today\u2019s podcast for some punditry on how American civil society has mishandled the pandemic, a debate over whether calling female political candidates \u201cambitious\u201d is inherently sexist, and some bickering over America\u2019s best sit-down diners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-Jonathan Swan\u2019s Axios interview with the president, Sarah\u2019s newsletter The Sweep, Jonah\u2019s column this week on mail-in voting.\r\n\r\n-25 percent of the mail-in ballots cast from Brooklyn for the primary election were disqualified.\r\n\r\n-\u201cHow the Pandemic Defeated America\u201d by Ed Yong in The Atlantic.\r\n\r\n-\u201c \u2018She had no remorse\u2019: Why Kamala Harris isn't a lock for VP\u201d in Politico."

Larry Hogan had some blunt criticism for the incumbent president of his own political party on the latest Dispatch Podcast, and all but ruled out supporting Donald Trump in November.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis week the president said he was going to cut funding for testing,\u201d said Hogan, in conversation with Sarah Isgur and Steve Hayes. \u201cThat was one of the dumbest things I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Hogan continued: \u201cMy biggest criticism was at the beginning the president didn\u2019t take it seriously enough, and was downplaying the severity of the crisis.\u201d\r\n\r\nHogan believes that the Trump administration has since made progress with its coronavirus strategy, and he\u2019s encouraged that Trump finally donned a mask in public and spoke publicly about the importance of wearing one. But, he added, the federal government is still months behind on testing and tracing and appears to be no closer to coming up with a national testing plan, an inexcusable oversight.\r\n\r\nHogan went further than he has before in discussing whether he intends to support his fellow Republican in November. \u201cProbably not,\u201d Hogan said.\r\n\r\nHogan also believes the GOP has a lot of work to do to recover in a post-Trump era. When pressed on whether the president has grown the Republican Party, he said, \u201cNo I don\u2019t think he has at all,\u201d pointing to Haley Barbour\u2019s truism that politics is about addition and multiplication, not subtraction and division. \u201cQuite frankly, I think the president has really been focused on, you know, dividing and subtracting.\u201d\r\n\r\nListen to Hogan, Sarah, and Steve discuss the ins and outs of coronavirus strategizing from a policymaker\u2019s perspective and his hopes for the future of the Republican Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-Hogan\u2019s recent book, Still Standing: Surviving Cancer, Riots, a Global Pandemic, and the Toxic Politics that Divide America"
