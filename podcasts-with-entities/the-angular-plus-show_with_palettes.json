In this episode, we welcome Willian Correa, the VP of Technology at Rangle, to share with us his experience and insight into software delivery performance. We'll discuss the 4 metrics that are used to measure software delivery performance and then those activities identified by high-performing organizations. Hint, while the metrics and activities are no secret, the secret sauce is executing all of the best practices simultaneously. And, for a bit of spice, we discuss Extreme Programming and Pair Programming and uncover some myths about these strategies.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/dora-2022-accelerate-state-of-devops-report-now-out\" rel=\"noopener\">https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/dora-2022-accelerate-state-of-devops-report-now-out</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.rangle.io\" rel=\"noopener\">www.rangle.io</a> <br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wgcorrea\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/wgcorrea</a><br /><br />Commercial at start of show: <br /><a href=\"https://try.rollbar.com/angular\" rel=\"noopener\">https://try.rollbar.com/angular</a>"

We also learn from Joel a few strategies for sharing dependencies, such as module federation or SystemJS.<br /><br />The biggest takeaway from this episode is that MFE architecture requires independent deployments. That means you should be able to deploy a single SPA without having to deploy all applications in the MFE. Of course, there are other opportunities to tackle when building an MFE, including server rendering, sharing dependencies, and sharing components that we discuss.<br /><br />Part 2 of our series on MFEs is jam-packed with knowledge as well as tips and tricks for tackling the complexities of building at scale with microfrontends.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Joelbdenning\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/Joelbdenning</a>",

So, go ahead, book that family vacation this Christmas, and go check out xlts.dev to get extended long-term support for your organization's Angular.js apps."

So, why not create the apps of today and the future using a stack like Angular and Ionic? <br /><br />In this episode, Max shares the history of how they got started with Ionic, from rebuilding Cordova and PhoneGap, to solving the developer experience using new tooling, building the component view library, and Capacitor, an open-source cross-platform native bridge built and supported by the Ionic team.",

Mike joins our panelists Aaron Frosts, Jennifer Wadella, and Brian Love, to chat about NgRx Effects best practices.<br /><br />NgRx is the defacto standard state management solution for Angular. While the core state module is highly inspired by Redux, the Effects library is unique to NgRx, and one of the best features of NgRx (in our humble opinion). NgRx Effects enable developers to perform side effects, like fetching data from an API, in an elegant and efficient manner. But, effects can also be tricky, hard to test, and sometimes it's not clear what RxJS operator is best suited for an effect.<br /><br />In this episode, we learn from Mike the best practices of using NgRx Effects, how to make them simpler, more maintainable, and easier to test.

Mike joins our panelists Aaron Frosts, Jennifer Wadella, and Brian Love, to chat about NgRx Effects best practices.\nNgRx is the defacto standard state management solution for Angular. While the core state module is highly inspired by Redux, the Effects library is unique to NgRx, and one of the best features of NgRx (in our humble opinion). NgRx Effects enable developers to perform side effects, like fetching data from an API, in an elegant and efficient manner. But, effects can also be tricky, hard to test, and sometimes it's not clear what RxJS operator is best suited for an effect.\nIn this episode, we learn from Mike the best practices of using NgRx Effects, how to make them simpler, more maintainable, and easier to test.

Google set out to solve this problem and built Blaze, and then released Bazel as an open-source project in 2015. In this show, we learned from Zack Gray, from Flare.build, about how Bazel is an automated tool for building and testing. Bazel is language and framework agnostic, meaning, it can be used to build and test not just TypeScript and JavaScript, but any language. Further, Bazel leverages parallelization, enabling the tool to build multiple aspects/modules of your application simultaneously. This also leads to building and testing across many machines. Finally, Bazel is smart enough to only build the artifacts that need to be re-built. This leads to incredible performance and reliability.<br /><br />If Blaze sounds like a potential solution for you, then this is an episode of the Angular Show that you will want to listen to. Finally, if you need help with building, running, configuring, and extending Blaze, then be sure to reach out to Zach and the team at Flare.build.<br /><br />Connect with us:<br /><br />Zach Gray - @zachgray_io<br />Brian F Love - @brian_love<br />Jennifer Wadella - @likeOMGitsFEDAY<br />Aaron Frost - @aaronfrost"

Minko Gechev is a longtime contributor to Angular, a member of the Angular Team, a good friend of ours, and an all-around wonderful person to spend time with. To kick things off, Minko takes us through some of the big changes as part of the Angular version 12 release, including Ivy (no not the plant, the new-ish compilation and rendering pipeline in Angular) libraries and the final sail-off of ViewEngine (the thing that Ivy replaces), updates to the Language Service (VS Code plugin) to use Ivy, strict mode as the new default for new Angular projections, webpack 5 support, nullish coalescing operator in templates, and inline Sass.

Ana shares a bit of her story about how she got started, was mentored by Sherry List, and began engaging with technical communities, the JavaScript community, and of course, the Angular Community. Ana's story is both inspiration and education, and we know you will enjoy this special episode from the Angular Show.<br /><br />Ana shares how being a DevRel is not about selling, rather, developer relations is about building tools and education so that developers will remember a specific product or solution when they need it. She also shares with us about the Avocado Labs initiative that she pioneers at Auth0. Avocado Labs provides educational online content for developers, focusing on frontend engineering technologies, and of course, security and identity management. Avocado Labs hosts online presentations and panels. They have upcoming events that you can sign up for, as well as recordings from past events.<br /><br />In a rift with Ana about online communities, our beloved panelist Brian proposes an (according to Jennifer \"cute\") community idea called \"async/await\" where attendees consume some educational online content asynchronously on your own, and then gather later in-person, or online, to discuss, ask questions, or have a panel. It's an idea, and you hear it here first. <br /><br />Finally, Ana shares with us the Auth0 Ambassador program, how it works, the perks, and more.

What about Nx from the team at Nrwl?<br /><br />Join us as we spend some time learning from Benjamin Cabanes, an expert on Angular workspaces, and a senior engineer at Nrwl. Ben clearly defines what a workspace is, and what it is not. We learn from Ben how the Angular Workspace is configured, the primary components, and how it all fits together and integrates with the Angular CLI. Ben also teaches us about the benefits of a workspace over simply code colocation, and how we can use the power of Nx to improve the developer experience in our organizations.<br /><br />Be sure to subscribe so you can continue to learn from experts like Ben and the amazing Angular community.<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />Node Rockets - <a href=\"https://www.node-rockets.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.node-rockets.com/</a><br /><br />Connect with us: <br />Benjamin Cabanes - @bencabanes<br />Brian F Love - @brian_love<br />Aaron Frost - @aaronfrost"

And, while databases may not be something you are familiar with or really have to even worry about, we wanted to take a break from our usual programming to reflect briefly on data persistence. After all, you need to put your user data somewhere, and we don't recommend stuffing everything into localStorage.<br /><br />In this episode, panelists Brian Love, Jennifer Wadella, and Aaron Frost welcome Oren Eini, founder of RavenDB, to the Angular Show.

The filtering operators enable developers to filter next notifications from an Observable.<br /><br />The most logical filtering operator to start with is, well, you guessed it, the filter() operator. From there, we look to the operators that only emit a single next notification: first(), last(), find(), and single(). Most of these operators are fairly straight-forward, and often have an optional predicate that can be provided to determine when the operator returns a new Observable that immediately emits the next notification to the Observer, or to the next operator in the pipe. Moving onward Lara teaches us about the family of take() and skip() operators. We didn't list them out here since we are lazy and don't want to type them all out, plus, you should really just have a listen to the show and subscribe! Ok, phew, now Lara and the panelists talk about the ignoreElement() operator, which like the window() operator, has nothing to do with the DOM. Rounding the final bend in our run through the filtering operators we talk about the family of distinct() operators. And, with a sprint to the finish line, we learn about the audit(), debounce() and simple() operators for rate limiting. Speaking of rate-limiting, this is getting long.

For some, a linter is that round brush-thingy with sticky paper that you use to remove your cat's fur from your otherwise beautiful jacket before going out in public. For computer software engineers, a linter is a program that uses static analysis to determine if there are potential errors, stylistic problems, or other suspicious operations in an application. Attempting to use your lint brush with an Angular application might be tricky, or perhaps, it's an alternative method to cleaning the grime off your screen that has been there for months and you can somehow see past every day. Instead, Angular developers have long relied on tslint, which is a lint tool specifically built for TypeScript. Things were good, well, mostly good, up until last year when, in the midst of quarantining and eating ramen, you read a tweet that said maintenance of tslint was coming to an end. So, what is an Angular developer to do?<br /><br />Enter James Henry. James is a Consultant Architect for Nrwl, and generally coined by the Angular Show, as \"that good looking guy at Narwhal\" (not that everyone else isn't beautiful). James has worked alongside the eslint team for many years, and has provided a solution to those using TypeScript, and thus tslint, to migrate and leverage the power of eslint. James talks through his journey working with eslint, TypeScript, and more. To further prove that James good looking (scratch that)... an outstanding contributor to the community, James has provided a migration path for the most common tslint rules to eslint rules.<br /><br />Should you migrate to eslint today? How difficult is it? What about my existing tslint rules? Those are all great questions, and the panelists will explore and learn from James the answers to those questions and more.

For some, a linter is that round brush-thingy with sticky paper that you use to remove your cat's fur from your otherwise beautiful jacket before going out in public.

Attempting to use your lint brush with an Angular application might be tricky, or perhaps, it's an alternative method to cleaning the grime off your screen that has been there for months and you can somehow see past every day.

One of the biggest advantages is the ability to dynamically and programmatically define form groups, arrays, and controls. Further, Angular Formly provides wrappers for control appearances based on several popular UI component libraries, such as Angular Material and Bootstrap, or you can create your own UI wrapper if necessary.<br /><br />Connect with us: <br />Juri Strumpflohner - @juristr<br />Bram Borggreve - @beeman_nl<br />Aaron Frost - @aaronfrost<br />Jennifer Wadella - @likeOMGitsFEDAY<br />Brian Love - @brian_love"

                "summary": "Join us in part two of our series on RxJS Operators. As Angular developers, we rely on RxJS primary for asynchronous operations via the Observable primitive. While we can think of an Observable like a Promise, and simply subscribe, we can also take advantage of the many, many operators at our disposal for the transformation of events and data within the Observable stream.<br /><br />In order to learn more about RxJS transformation operators, we invited Lara Newsom and Zack De Rose to the podcast. Lara and Zack have a wealth of knowledge in both Angular and RxJS. Lara is a software engineer at Source Allies, a technical consultancy located in Iowa; and Zack is a senior software engineer at Narwhal, where they build Nx and Nx Cloud, as well as provide Angular consulting services.<br /><br />To get started, the group tackles the mapping operators, including map, pluck, scan, and reduce. They then dive into the various higher-order mapping operators, including switchMap, exhaustMap, mergeMap, and concatMap. Learning the different behaviors of each of the mapping operators is important when determining which operator to use within the pipe method. Next, the panel talks about the buffer operators, including buffer, bufferCount, and bufferTime. This then leads into discussion about the window operators, including window, windowCount, and windowTime, all of which have nothing to do with the global window variable in JavaScript when executing in the context of a browser.<br /><br />This episode is jam-packed with great content, humor, and fun.

                "summary": "RxJS provides both the observable primitives as well as a broad set of operators for the creation and transformation of data. And, as you know, Angular leverages RxJS for cancelable asynchronous actions and events. In our opinion, the two are a perfect match. Interactions with web applications are asynchronous in nature and Angular provides a robust solution to detecting those asynchronous actions, enabling developers to build interactive experiences for the web with ease.<br /><br />In this series on RxJS operators, we help you learn the operators. As you likely know, there are a lot of them, and it can be difficult to know what each of them does, and often, how to determine which operator, or operators, are succinct and current for solving the complexities of streaming data, actions, and events in our applications.<br /><br />Join panelists Jennifer Wadella, Aaron Frost, Brian Love, and guest Jan-Niklas Wortmann as we explore the creation operators. These functions enable the creation of new observables, or the composing of existing observables into a new observable stream. Jan-Niklas is a Google Developer Expert in Angular and volunteers his time on the RxJS core team. Listen in and learn from Jan-Niklas as he teaches us about many of the creation operators in RxJS. We're sure you'll walk away from this episode with a new and expanded knowledge of RxJS.<br /><br />Find us on Twitter:<br />Jan-Niklas Wortmann | @niklas_wortmann<br />Brian Love | @brian_love<br />Jennifer Wadella | @likeOMGitsFEDAY<br />Aaron Frost | @aaronfrost"

In this episode, panelists Aaron Frost, Brian Love, and Jennifer Wadella are 'buzzing' with details on MobX, Akita, and NGXS. <br /><br />All three of these solutions can be used in Angular, are open-source, and are free to use. MobX is widely used with React, perhaps the second favorite after redux, for state management. Akita, from the team at Datarama, takes a slightly different approach from the redux pattern for providing a state management solution. Akita is popular within the Angular community, but can also be used with both React and Svelte projections. Finally, NGXS is inspired by redux and NgRx and makes heavy use of TypeScript decorators to achieve similar goals as NgRx with a potential lower code cost.<br /><br />Join us in part 5 of our series on state management in Angular and come along with the panelists and learn about various solutions that you might want to consider for your Angular application.",

Externally, the tooling team ships the Angular CLI, which includes the out-of-the-box end-to-end testing tool called Protractor. Join\u00a0panelists Aaron Frost, Brian Love, and\u00a0Jennifer Wadella\u00a0as we learn from Keen about the current direction of Protractor.<br /><br />The recently released version 7 of Protractor focused solely on security issues, resulting in the necessity to update dependencies, leading to a major release bump. If you've been using Protractor for some time, you might be asking, \"Wait, what happened to version 6?\"\u00a0Well, v6 was a release-to-evaluate webdriver version 4 (still in alpha) and was never released, and likely won't ever be released.

This series tackles all of these questions and more.<br /><br />In part one, panelists Aaron Frost and Jennifer Wadella invite Joe Eames, CEO of Thinkster.io and Pluralsight author, along with Shai Reznik, founder and author of testangular.com, to share their knowledge and love of unit testing in Angular.<br /><br />While you are most likely performing manual testing, you may not be leveraging automated testing. Automated testing enables us to prevent regressions, increasing the quality of our applications. While many of us may not be leveraging automated testing, it can be extremely valuable when moving fast, when we have multiple developers on a team or in the code base, and perhaps even multiple teams in an organization that is sharing the same code and repository. The end result is confidence. Having a high level of confidence in shipping quality software provides significant value. Of course, implementing an automated testing strategy comes at a cost. Weighing the benefits with the cost is critical and should not be missed in your organization or team.<br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe so you can be notified when Testing Series Part 2 on using Jest for unit testing in Angular is available for download!",

This series tackles all of these questions and more.\nIn part one, panelists Aaron Frost and Jennifer Wadella invite Joe Eames, CEO of Thinkster.io and Pluralsight author, along with Shai Reznik, founder and author of testangular.com, to share their knowledge and love of unit testing in Angular.\nWhile you are most likely performing manual testing, you may not be leveraging automated testing. Automated testing enables us to prevent regressions, increasing the quality of our applications. While many of us may not be leveraging automated testing, it can be extremely valuable when moving fast, when we have multiple developers on a team or in the code base, and perhaps even multiple teams in an organization that is sharing the same code and repository. The end result is confidence. Having a high level of confidence in shipping quality software provides significant value. Of course, implementing an automated testing strategy comes at a cost. Weighing the benefits with the cost is critical and should not be missed in your organization or team.\nDon't forget to subscribe so you can be notified when Testing Series Part 2 on using Jest for unit testing in Angular is available for download!",

                "summary": "In this episode, Kseniya Lifanova from Upstate Interactive joins panelists Aaron Frost, Alyssa Nicoll, Brian Love, and Shai Reznik to share her insights on Women in Technology. Kseniya's background is in business and finance, and after about 7 years in accountancy and finance, she found her passion for technology.<br /><br />She attended an introduction to web development night-school and fell in love with building things. But, one of the first things she noticed in tech, was that it was mostly men. She decided to co-found a women-in-tech coding group in Syracuse, NY to teach other women about technology, coding, and the web. You might be wondering, why are there women-specific groups? Kseniya shares with us the intimidation that some women feel when attending events that are predominantly attended by men. She also shares how she wanted to learn with and be around other women.<br /><br />If you're an organizer for a meetup, event, conference, or other event, this episode is critical to listen to. Join us as we learn from Kseniya how we can lower barriers to entry, make women feel comfortable and invited, and lift up women in technology.<br /><br />Show Notes:<br />\u25ba <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/magazine/women-coding-computer-programming.html\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/magazine/women-coding-computer-programming.html</a><br />\u25ba <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Superpower-Generation-American-Preeminence/dp/1455583685\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Superpower-Generation-American-Preeminence/dp/1455583685</a>"
