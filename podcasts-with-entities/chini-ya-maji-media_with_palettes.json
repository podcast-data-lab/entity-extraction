I thought it would be a good idea to have Kavere share some legal does and don\u2019ts that can help entrepreneurs navigate what can often be the intimidating subject area of legal. LAK advocates have been super helpful to us and I would recommend them to anyone seeking good, solid, approachable legal counsel. As usual the conversation is peppered with many interesting anecdotes from her experiences working at some well known institutions. Quite a few eye popping insights on this one.
