We recorded Mikl\u00f3s speaking at an event for aspiring CEOs that McKinsey held in San Diego earlier this year. He explored how the most successful companies in the new economy aren\u2019t the ones that have applied old-school best practices but, instead, have adopted entirely new mindsets and approaches for a fundamentally transforming market.\n\r\nPre-order \u2018The Ecosystem Economy: How to Lead in the New Age of Sectors Without Borders\u2019: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Ecosystem-Revolution-Sectors-Without-Borders/dp/1119984785\n\r\nContact Mikl\u00f3s Ga\u0301bor Dietz:\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/miklos-dietz\n\r\nJoin our LinkedIn community:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance\n\r\nExplore more Inside the Strategy Room podcast episode transcripts:\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/itsr\nSee www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy for privacy information",

In this episode, we continue our series on board perspectives by looking at the board\u2019s role in helping organizations develop the right talent and culture. To explore this topic, Frithjof Lund, the global leader of McKinsey\u2019s board services work, speaks with two experts on governance and organization. Hugo Bague, a former group executive at Rio Tinto, is a non-executive director on the board of Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL), a global real estate services firm, where he chairs the compensation committee. Mary Meaney is a globally recognized leader on change management and organizational transformations who until recently co-led the global organization practice and served on McKinsey\u2019s global governance board.</span><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>",

In the first part of their conversation, they discussed the importance of taking a very granular approach to markets in developing countries, the constraints emerging economies place on business models, and the unique role ecosystems play. In this episode, Erik and Ireena dive into the importance of pegging capital investments to the realities of emerging economies and discuss some of the most exciting areas of innovation in those markets, including some fascinating initiatives in the public sector. We hope you enjoy this second part of their discussion.</span><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>",

It features two partners who are spearheading our research on these topics. Martin Hirt, the global co-leader of the Strategy and Corporate Finance Practice, is a co-author of the recent article on the COVID-19 exit and of the book Strategy Beyond the Hockey Stick, upon which some of the conversation is based. Anna Koivuniemi co-leads the growth service line globally and is the co-author of recent articles on through-cycle growth out-performers and lessons from growth transformations.</span><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>",
