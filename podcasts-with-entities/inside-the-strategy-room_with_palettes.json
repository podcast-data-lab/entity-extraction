And what should you expect from it?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Traditionally, established corporations have tended to view start-ups as undisciplined and naive, while start-ups might dismiss incumbents as stodgy and behind the times. It\u2019s (mostly) not like that anymore, as both sides increasingly recognize each other\u2019s strengths and the value of collaborating. In fact, large companies are now involved in about a third of all venture deals\u2014an all-time high. More than three-quarters of the Fortune 100 are active in the venture capital (VC) space and half have a VC arm set up as a subsidiary, not including companies with internal VC business units.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Joining us to discuss this innovation and investment landscape are <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/matt-banholzer\">Matt Banholzer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidramtri/?originalSubdomain=uk\">Sid Ramtri</a>.

The most recent three he built largely through acquisitions: United Rentals, an industrial equipment rental company; United Waste Systems, involved in garbage collection; and XPO, the logistics company he currently leads. At both United Rentals and United Waste, he executed more than 200 deals each. At XPO, he has created a digital-forward logistics leader in an industry that has tended to lag in technology adoption. \r\n\r\n<p>Brad will soon transition from CEO to executive chairman of XPO. We thought it\u2019d be a good time to ask him to share the lessons he has learned over the course of his extensive deal-making experience.
