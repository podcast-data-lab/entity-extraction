In this episode, we continue our series on board perspectives by looking at the board\u2019s role in helping organizations develop the right talent and culture. To explore this topic, Frithjof Lund, the global leader of McKinsey\u2019s board services work, speaks with two experts on governance and organization. Hugo Bague, a former group executive at Rio Tinto, is a non-executive director on the board of Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL), a global real estate services firm, where he chairs the compensation committee. Mary Meaney is a globally recognized leader on change management and organizational transformations who until recently co-led the global organization practice and served on McKinsey\u2019s global governance board.</span><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/\" rel=\"payment\">Join 90,000 other members of our LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mckinsey-strategy-&-corporate-finance/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy\">www.mckinsey.com/privacy-policy</a> for privacy information</p>",

This episode of the Inside the Strategy Room podcast focuses on board priorities in the new era. Frithjof Lund, a senior partner and the leader of our board services work, speaks with two cybersecurity experts about how boards of directors should help their organizations ensure they are prepared for potential cyberattacks. John Noble is the former director of the United Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, and a board member ofNHS Digital, the national information and technology partner to the country\u2019s National Health Service.

Today we are talking about how large companies can take innovation plays from startups' play books to make them more competitive.

We'll see how larger companies can emulate some of that behaviour.
