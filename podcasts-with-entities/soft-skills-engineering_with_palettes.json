I listen to this show every week as the soft skills you discuss are just as applicable to my role as an electronics engineer.</p>\n\n    <p>I have 5 years of experience and in my opinion, the right level of competency to step in to a senior role. I recently started a new job and I\u2019ve been encouraged by my boss to be more proactive in taking on senior work so I can be considered for a senior engineer promotion. The problem is, the existing senior engineers in my team are uninterested in sharing their workload with me. I will try to assist them with their senior-level tasks but it never lasts long as they will carry on with the work themselves after a short while. I\u2019ve also been assigned senior-level tasks by my boss and when I\u2019ve asked for small levels of assistance from the senior engineers they\u2019ve taken it as an invitation to do the rest of the work for me.</p>\n\n    <p>My boss is indifferent to my struggle as he only cares about the output of our team as a whole and not who does what. I know that I\u2019m performing well as I was recently given a good performance review, so I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m being denied these chances to step up.</p>\n\n    <p>I don\u2019t want to quit as I just started this job and the pay is good.

            "contentSnippet": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nI\u2019m not a software engineer, so you can stop reading here if you like ;-). I listen to this show every week as the soft skills you discuss are just as applicable to my role as an electronics engineer.\nI have 5 years of experience and in my opinion, the right level of competency to step in to a senior role. I recently started a new job and I\u2019ve been encouraged by my boss to be more proactive in taking on senior work so I can be considered for a senior engineer promotion. The problem is, the existing senior engineers in my team are uninterested in sharing their workload with me. I will try to assist them with their senior-level tasks but it never lasts long as they will carry on with the work themselves after a short while. I\u2019ve also been assigned senior-level tasks by my boss and when I\u2019ve asked for small levels of assistance from the senior engineers they\u2019ve taken it as an invitation to do the rest of the work for me.\nMy boss is indifferent to my struggle as he only cares about the output of our team as a whole and not who does what. I know that I\u2019m performing well as I was recently given a good performance review, so I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m being denied these chances to step up.\nI don\u2019t want to quit as I just started this job and the pay is good. But I also don\u2019t want to just sit idly as a mid-level engineer while everyone I know gets promoted. What can I do?\nI am a junior dev and recently accepted a C2H position at a large enterprise company as a junior developer.

I like him being proactive, but this is causing big trouble: bugs, technical debt and often absolutely useless code. We had several discussions in the team pointing out some of the problems, but he is not interesested in changing his behaviour. During the last discussion he didn\u2019t react to any of our arguments, just insisted on doing things his way.

There is, as always, some organization-specific context that I am familiar with, and the principal engineer is not. As a mid-level IC, I am not used to being a repository of knowledge for engineers that many roles above me, and have only ever been on a team that hired engineers at my skill level or below.

We do not understand each other and I am usually left feeling like I missed something or I am not interpreting his question correctly.

I know and trust my team mates. This is only the second time in my career where I just did not get along well with someone. The meeting was supposed to be some feedback for him and me, some career development, and some goals for 2023. It ended up with him giving lots of examples of technical deficiencies, the fact that I am unable to work independently (which is not true, I ask more senior engineers for help), the fact that I give him pushback (no duh why at this point). He even said I was careless because I made some silly copy paste errors in my code (which we all do and is human). [Sidenote: he does not code. He just sometimes asks questions on prs or gives nits.]</p>\n\n    <p>I do not know what to do. His manager J used to be my manager. Should I talk to J about my issues since he knows both of us well? Do I go to my manager with ways that I would prefer our 1x1s go and how I personally like to get feedback? Do I ask for a new manager? I know he says he wants me to succeed, but nothing in the last 4 months have made me feel like that is true. I am a young woman in engineering, and I have never felt less trusted by a coworker.

Any questions we ask of the founders we get about a 30% reply rate no matter the form of communication.\nWe get poorly defined tasks and requirements\nThe CTO will just blast through some of our features over the weekend and say here I fixed it for you\nI don\u2019t want to quit my job (just yet\u2026 its a comin though).\nI have actually discussed the above points with them, but I know these 2 founders will never change their ways.\nHow do I tell them I just want to go back to being an Individual Contributor like my Employment contract states?",

There\u2019s a person who joined my team with the same job title and level as me (senior product designer/L5) more than a year ago, and since then he has shown that he not only lacks a lot of skills to be considered senior but also lacks the self-awareness to see where he falls short and how he needs to improve. There have been multiple occasions in our 1:1s where he has alluded to critical feedback he\u2019s gotten from people on our team (including our manager) and has written it off as irrelevant or untrue, will come up with excuses for his poor performance, and will make off-hand comments about the person as a way to discount their credibility. Overall I feel like this is part of a larger display of narcissist behavior; I\u2019ve noticed that the only time he\u2019ll listen to suggestions is if you make it not sound critical and sandwich them in between compliments.</p>\n\n    <p>Up until now, I (hopefully) have avoided being on the receiving end of his negative comments, but since I\u2019m trying to go for promotion, my manager wants me to give him more guidance and tell him directly the feedback that I\u2019ve brought up to her. Seeing how he\u2019s reacted in the past, I\u2019m unsure how to just start giving him unsolicited feedback and am afraid of what he\u2019ll think and say to others about me as someone with four less years of industry experience trying to give him advice. I\u2019m also afraid that this will damage our working relationship as I\u2019ve seen how despondent he becomes when things don\u2019t go his way. I\u2019ve told my manager these concerns and her response was that it isn\u2019t on me if he reacts poorly to my feedback, but I feel like putting in the energy to give him feedback that he probably won\u2019t even listen to is exhausting and isn\u2019t worth the possibility of him becoming more adversarial towards me.

I have a senior colleague who has been there maybe 8 months more than me. Whenever he has a problem, he likes to call me away from my desk and start explaining his entire problem to me. I have no knowledge of the real codebase yet and am not even an experienced programmer as I barely have 2 year of experience. I just stand there and nod and give various quips from time to time to pretend I\u2019m listening. This can last up to 30 minutes and happens numerous times a day. If I say I\u2019m busy he just waits 5 minutes before calling me over again. I cant get any work done because of this. How do I deal with this senior team mate that uses me as a rubber duck.

I have a senior colleague who has been there maybe 8 months more than me. Whenever he has a problem, he likes to call me away from my desk and start explaining his entire problem to me. I have no knowledge of the real codebase yet and am not even an experienced programmer as I barely have 2 year of experience. I just stand there and nod and give various quips from time to time to pretend I\u2019m listening. This can last up to 30 minutes and happens numerous times a day. If I say I\u2019m busy he just waits 5 minutes before calling me over again. I cant get any work done because of this. How do I deal with this senior team mate that uses me as a rubber duck. Should I just buy him an actual rubber duck ?",

Like no team may wanna hire a \u201cjunior\u201d senior?\nLove the show! Keep it up.",

I\u2019ve gotten bumped in compensation fairly, almost 25% raise since I first started.\nMy career goal is to stay on the programming side but want to become a possible trainer for newer engineers/devs.\nListener Michael asks,\nI\u2019m a backend engineer in an engineering/coding role with a small bit of SRE type work. I love the work as I get to dig deep into tech we use and have become subject a matter expert on databases within the company. I really like my team and my manager in particular, and get to learn a lot every week.\nMy manager is leaving my team to lead a new team within the company that is focused on the company\u2019s SaaS offering and I\u2019ve been given the option of joining this new team if I wish. I like their managerial style and how they have helped me with my career progression so far. However, I\u2019d be doing Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) work. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready yet to commit to being an SRE and code less/focus more on ensuring the reliability of mission critical production systems. I don\u2019t know how easy it would be to switch back to more of a coding role in a years time or if it would pigeonhole me into that type of role. Have you got any advice?",

I\u2019m eager to help the team deliver.\nBut I also don\u2019t want to be seen as the know-it-all jerk that tells everyone how to do their job. I have respect for my team and want to contribute. How do I use my experience without annoying my colleagues?\nThanks for sharing your wisdom (I hope for 101% of it).\nListener Andy asks,\nI moved to company A and it\u2019s been 6 months I am constantly getting interview requests, Gave an interview and got a 30% rise moved to Company B, Now within 6 months the same thing happened, Gave an interview at Company C and got the job with  30% raise.  what should I do? will it affect my long term career growth",

That\u2019s fine but I never get questions answered and I hate my job with my client and hate my job with this company that sells me like a cheap piece of meat. I want to quit, I will quit, but I have a lot to say about why I\u2019m quitting.  How can I NOT be nice about quitting and the reasons I\u2019m quitting, and still feel comfortable showing my face in the industry again?\nI haven\u2019t quit a job before, and this is my first job in the tech industry. Searching how to quit a job always comes with \u201cremain light and positive.",

How do you answer the statement \u201cYou\u2019re very quiet. Like really quiet\u201d? Me? I tend to give a small smile or recently, I said \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n\n    <p>I\u2019m a software developer in a large defense company and I\u2019m on my third and final year of my rotational program. I just rotated back to the same area as my first rotation, so I know a couple of folks. However, I\u2019m not SUPER close to these people. My team is fairly new, but most of the members started at the same time, unlike me, who started just three weeks ago. I want to try to know people and get close to them, but at the same time I know my energy lowers after a couple interactions. I have always been known to be quiet, but I don\u2019t want to be known as the odd developer out on my team. The team seems to already know and like each other.

How do you answer the statement \u201cYou\u2019re very quiet. Like really quiet\u201d? Me? I tend to give a small smile or recently, I said \u201cI know.\u201d\nI\u2019m a software developer in a large defense company and I\u2019m on my third and final year of my rotational program. I just rotated back to the same area as my first rotation, so I know a couple of folks. However, I\u2019m not SUPER close to these people. My team is fairly new, but most of the members started at the same time, unlike me, who started just three weeks ago. I want to try to know people and get close to them, but at the same time I know my energy lowers after a couple interactions. I have always been known to be quiet, but I don\u2019t want to be known as the odd developer out on my team. The team seems to already know and like each other. I still talk, but only when I have things to say. I tend to stick to doing actually work, while others walk around and talk to people.

I want to stay at the company and also want the shiny new SENIOR job title, so I feel like I don\u2019t have much leverage in this situation. Any advice is appreciated!\nRachel asks,\nLive coding makes me choke. As soon as someone else is watching, my brain immediately goes to mush and I\u2019m like a chicken with my head cut off. Actually recently I learned it\u2019s not just live coding \u2013 it extends to live spreadsheet-making and live cooking as well! I guess I\u2019m not into performing? Anyway, this has come up because it\u2019s impacting my career in real ways. For interviews I offer to do takehomes, which I\u2019m great at, but sometimes I\u2019m told live coding is the standard they apply to all applicants. What\u2019s a non-live coder to do?\nShow Notes\nConsumer price index: https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\n@Channel Twitter account: https://twitter.com/Channel\nhttps://interviewing.io/",

On top of all that I think the work is technically interesting! But still I\u2019m bored and disengaged :(\nI can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m just burned out from the pandemic and this is how it\u2019s manifesting, or if I just have a serious case of \u201cthe grass is always greener\u201d and now that I\u2019ve been on this team for 2 years I\u2019m ready just for a change of scenery. I want to fall back in love with this job, but how can I do that? Do you have any advice? Changing teams isn\u2019t a great fit as this is a small office for the company in a \u201c\u201csatellite\u201d\u201d site, with only one other team that I\u2019m not super interested in.\nI could of course take the patented advice and find a new job that might be equally great, but what else can I do?\nListener Very Verbose asks,\nLove the show! I\u2019m rapidly working my way through the backlog and dread the day that I reach the end and have to wait a whole week for the next one! :)\nWhenever I write a message to a coworker I tend to start with a huge wall of text, then revise it down to something smaller and hit send. I do this with emails, slack messages, code review feedback, you name it.

It\u2019s a new team and I have determined after talking to everyone for a few weeks, that about 1/3 of the team does not know Python, 2 even admitting to me privately they lied in the interview, and probably 50-60% have no idea what git is. I feel like they hired a bunch of excel, tableau, business-y people and assumed any experience with data qualified you to do data science. You may say \u201cquit your job\u201d but this is my first job out of college and I don\u2019t think I could find another easily. Do I tell my manager about this? How do I teach them these things? I\u2019ve already had to pick up a lot of slack on the team, luckily since I have no kids, no girlfriend, a ton of free time, and have been coding since middle school it\u2019s been manageable, but I\u2019m concerned about how to handle this going forward.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n",

Then I joined as a full-time employee, and things were good at first.\nFor the past year, things have gone downhill.\nI barely get to write code and spend most of my time reviewing and writing documents in excel and word.\nI find this unsatisfying and can barely get the work assigned to me done due to lack of motivation and interest.\nHowever, I am fairly convinced that the compensation and other perks I get here, as well as the coworkers and management here are some of the best I could find.\nShould I follow the soft skills advice and quit, or should I stick around because of the other favourable conditions I mentioned? In other words, how should I decide between satisfying work vs the favourable conditions?\nHi, I am a data scientist. I work on a team of about 30 other data scientists. It\u2019s a new team and I have determined after talking to everyone for a few weeks, that about 1/3 of the team does not know Python, 2 even admitting to me privately they lied in the interview, and probably 50-60% have no idea what git is. I feel like they hired a bunch of excel, tableau, business-y people and assumed any experience with data qualified you to do data science. You may say \u201cquit your job\u201d but this is my first job out of college and I don\u2019t think I could find another easily. Do I tell my manager about this? How do I teach them these things? I\u2019ve already had to pick up a lot of slack on the team, luckily since I have no kids, no girlfriend, a ton of free time, and have been coding since middle school it\u2019s been manageable, but I\u2019m concerned about how to handle this going forward.",

And even though I\u2019m employed now, I still keep working on more advanced classes in my spare time.\nHow can I communicate this to potential employers considering that I\u2019m not getting any academic credits for my effort? Should I just leave this off my resume? Is it okay to mention that I have audited those classes? Any other ideas?\nThanks for the lovely podcast.",

I have an awesome role as a senior developer working with interesting new technologies, a lot of flexibility, responsibilities and a valued opinion on both technological and company-wide matters. However, this is still my first job.\nI\u2019ve invested a lot of time and effort on career growth the last few years but I feel like there are only a few developers at my company who share the same level of enthusiasm and the need to grow as I do. I\u2019ve been able to bring in new tech, introduce modern practices and share knowledge with my colleagues, but it feels like I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s actively pushing for this.\nSince this is my first job, I don\u2019t know if this is the case in other places as well. I\u2019ve done some freelance projects on the side to learn more about how things work somewhere else  but mostly I\u2019m the only senior dev on these projects.\nOn the one hand I have a job that I love, on the other hand I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s out there. I feel like I might regret it later if I don\u2019t try something else but based on other people\u2019s experiences, I know it\u2019s hard to find a company with such a good culture and understanding as where I am right now. Switching jobs would also give me a significant salary increase, but will require a longer commute. There are only a few software companies in my area.\nCan you help me figure out if I should take the blue pill or the red pill?",

Love the show and your fun but useful answers.\nI have a career question and would love to hear what you think.\nI\u2019ve been an Engineer for several years now and was recently asked if I\u2019d like to move into Product Management. At first this sounded great. I\u2019d get to set the direction of the product, get involved with strategic planning and roadmap meetings, and generally have more input into my squads work.\nThe thing is \u2026 that isn\u2019t what it is at all. Most of the time I am fielding requests from marketing and sales people for sales collateral, sitting on customer calls, and digging through dashboards to find enough \u2018evidence\u2019 to prove why we should prioritize the backlog the way I have in mind, and I have even become the \u2018bad guy\u2019 when the squads ideas don\u2019t line up with the Product team.\nHave I made a terrible mistake? Is Product Management really a good move for Engineers?",

I am a senior software engineer at a tech company. How do I deal with a chronic toe-stepper-onner?</p>\n\n    <p>I have a coworker named Jimi Hendrix - also a senior software engineer - who has a habit of getting involved in and trying to manage my projects. He joins meetings and slack channels, uninvited, and starts asking people for status updates and questions them why things are done a certain way (and not the other), what\u2019s taking so long on unfinished tasks, etc. Jimi basically feels that my projects are his to oversee and manage.</p>\n\n    <p>So far, my response has only been passive aggressive - e.g. taking discussions to a different slack channel or thread, or meeting the team members offline when he is not around.

How do I deal with a chronic toe-stepper-onner?\nI have a coworker named Jimi Hendrix - also a senior software engineer - who has a habit of getting involved in and trying to manage my projects. He joins meetings and slack channels, uninvited, and starts asking people for status updates and questions them why things are done a certain way (and not the other), what\u2019s taking so long on unfinished tasks, etc. Jimi basically feels that my projects are his to oversee and manage.\nSo far, my response has only been passive aggressive - e.g. taking discussions to a different slack channel or thread, or meeting the team members offline when he is not around.

The office was mostly sales but also had a small dev team.</p>\n\n    <p>The in-house recruiter gave me a rough itinerary two days before: get there at 8AM, have four hour-long interviews with the team, then possibly a coding \u201cquiz.\u201d I was skeptical of what the quiz was but all she said was that everyone who got through the other interviews wouldn\u2019t have a problem, it was multiple-choice, and it would take less than half an hour. I get to the office 20 minutes early but have to wait 45 minutes more for my first round of interviews because an internal meeting went over; the recruiter apologizes and asks if I want breakfast, and I say I\u2019ll take something small like a bagel; she says okay and disappears from the room never to return with food.</p>\n\n    <p>I get through the culture interviews just fine, though I thought it was a bit odd that several of my interviewers (including a VP) brought in their catered breakfast/lunch into the room but never offered me to get some and I had to go find my recruiter so I could get a cup of water between interviews.</p>\n\n    <p>The final interview was with who would have been my boss: the senior engineering lead. She proceeds to ask me the normal bank of engineering questions and then lets me ask anything. She starts sending me the vibe that the engineering team isn\u2019t really respected and that as a junior I\u2019d be expected to put in overtime and be on-call on weekends without comp-time and without being able to have a say in when I would be on-call. Then I get some seemingly weird questions: Do you work well with loud noises? How noise canceling are your headphones usually? Is it okay that I would develop on a Windows machine?</p>\n\n    <p>The engineering lead takes me to the recruiter\u2019s office so I can wrap up the day but the recruiter had left early and nobody knew where she had gone so I was escorted to the front door by a receptionist and left. I didn\u2019t hear back for a week and got a call late in the evening saying they had moved on with other candidates. A few days later I got an email from the engineering lead apologizing for my experience and that they were revising their hiring process due to my experience.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Hi Dave and Jamison,</p>\n\n    <p>I have a crazy work story to share for your 200th show!</p>\n\n    <p>In my first role as a developer I was working for a small agency building websites for clients. One day I was uploading a new site, which involved FTPing into the server and doing all the config myself. I didn\u2019t really know what I was doing, all of this terminal stuff was pretty alien to me at the time. For some reason or another I needed to change the permissions on the files for this site, so I uploaded it to the server and ran a chmod, (which was a brand new concept to me - luckily Stack Overflow had my back. OR DID IT?) Anyway, when I ran the command, my terminal went crazy and way more files went flying up the screen than I had for my website, so I thought \u201c\u201cthat doesn\u2019t look right\u201d\u201d, hit ctrl-c and went to lunch, thinking I\u2019d fix it later.</p>\n\n    <p>When I got back from lunch, everyone was rushing about like headless chickens. Everything was down. When I enquired, it turned out that for some reason everyone was locked out of the entire server. After several hours it turned out that all of the permissions for every file on the server had been changed and nobody had any access to anything.

The office was mostly sales but also had a small dev team.\nThe in-house recruiter gave me a rough itinerary two days before: get there at 8AM, have four hour-long interviews with the team, then possibly a coding \u201cquiz.\u201d I was skeptical of what the quiz was but all she said was that everyone who got through the other interviews wouldn\u2019t have a problem, it was multiple-choice, and it would take less than half an hour. I get to the office 20 minutes early but have to wait 45 minutes more for my first round of interviews because an internal meeting went over; the recruiter apologizes and asks if I want breakfast, and I say I\u2019ll take something small like a bagel; she says okay and disappears from the room never to return with food.\nI get through the culture interviews just fine, though I thought it was a bit odd that several of my interviewers (including a VP) brought in their catered breakfast/lunch into the room but never offered me to get some and I had to go find my recruiter so I could get a cup of water between interviews.\nThe final interview was with who would have been my boss: the senior engineering lead. She proceeds to ask me the normal bank of engineering questions and then lets me ask anything. She starts sending me the vibe that the engineering team isn\u2019t really respected and that as a junior I\u2019d be expected to put in overtime and be on-call on weekends without comp-time and without being able to have a say in when I would be on-call. Then I get some seemingly weird questions: Do you work well with loud noises? How noise canceling are your headphones usually? Is it okay that I would develop on a Windows machine?\nThe engineering lead takes me to the recruiter\u2019s office so I can wrap up the day but the recruiter had left early and nobody knew where she had gone so I was escorted to the front door by a receptionist and left. I didn\u2019t hear back for a week and got a call late in the evening saying they had moved on with other candidates. A few days later I got an email from the engineering lead apologizing for my experience and that they were revising their hiring process due to my experience.\nHi Dave and Jamison,\nI have a crazy work story to share for your 200th show!\nIn my first role as a developer I was working for a small agency building websites for clients. One day I was uploading a new site, which involved FTPing into the server and doing all the config myself. I didn\u2019t really know what I was doing, all of this terminal stuff was pretty alien to me at the time. For some reason or another I needed to change the permissions on the files for this site, so I uploaded it to the server and ran a chmod, (which was a brand new concept to me - luckily Stack Overflow had my back. OR DID IT?) Anyway, when I ran the command, my terminal went crazy and way more files went flying up the screen than I had for my website, so I thought \u201c\u201cthat doesn\u2019t look right\u201d\u201d, hit ctrl-c and went to lunch, thinking I\u2019d fix it later.\nWhen I got back from lunch, everyone was rushing about like headless chickens. Everything was down. When I enquired, it turned out that for some reason everyone was locked out of the entire server. After several hours it turned out that all of the permissions for every file on the server had been changed and nobody had any access to anything. Also, every client site had been brought down in the process.\nTo make matters slightly worse, when I enquired about backups, it turned out that the main server WAS the backup server, because the main server died a couple of years before and nobody had bothered to fix or replace it. Whoops!\nI didn\u2019t fess up - I was too scared - but coincidentally, a few days later I was fired. Oddly, during the firing, no mention of this incident was made and to this day I have no idea if the two were related.\nAt the time I was devastated, I thought my career was over and I shed tears over how I was going to be able to provide for my family. However, in less than two weeks I was in a new role with a 25% pay increase, and my career has bloomed ever since. So \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I guess!\nAnd here ends my tale. I hope you enjoyed it - it was devastating at the time, but now I can look back on it with both amusement and bemusement.

The Asian office, and only the Asian office, has a fixed time schedule. To overlap with Europe, the Asian team has to be at the office from 2PM to 11PM. However, the European team comes in at 10AM and leaves at 7PM.\nWhen our team mates in Europe decide to do overtime, we have to stay later to work with them, often very late in the night but I tolerate it because I love software development. However, whenever we have company \u201cfun\u201d events, the Asian managers schedule it in the morning so that our regular work schedule won\u2019t be consumed. So we\u2019ll do badminton or wall-climbing from 9AM to 12 and then have to do the 2PM to 11PM shift. This is very tiring. The events usually happen every two weeks, but our schedule makes me dread them. It\u2019s even worse if the \u201cfun\u201d events happen on the same day as the overtime.

Charity is the CTO and former CEO of <a href=\"https://www.honeycomb.io\">Honeycomb</a>. She has worked at Second Life, Parse, Facebook, and more. She blogs at <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/\">charity.wtf</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Dave, Jamison, and Charity answer these questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>I\u2019ve had the role of tech lead informally for the past two years at a fast-growing tech startup. We were a team of 6 developers, and now we are 16. Recently, we had a department meeting in which the Software Development VP communicated that we have 3 teams and I was the tech lead of two of them. I was surprised. He hasn\u2019t mentioned his decision of splitting the teams nor that I\u2019ve been officially promoted to tech lead. I was expecting a one-on-one where he would \u201cpop the question\u201d: Will you be my tech lead?</p>\n\n    <p>I asked him privately if that meant I would be officially promoted and would have my title changed. He said that he was going to have this conversation with the HR Manager and would get back to me, but potentially.</p>\n\n    <p>He doesn\u2019t spend time on one-on-ones, nor is he very good at managing people although he\u2019s good technically. How weird is this situation? A manager tells his team that they now have a tech lead along some org changes. I haven\u2019t been informed, haven\u2019t had my title changed yet, and haven\u2019t been offered a raise yet.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Hi! I love your show and have been listening to it almost since day one. I was an engineer for about 10 years, and I\u2019ve been a manager for about 1 year, and I love my team. They\u2019re high performers, we have a high level of trust. I also like my boss! But the larger org has some issues, and in time-honored Soft Skills Engineering tradition, I plan to quit.

            "contentSnippet": "We\u2019re excited to have special guest Charity Majors on the show! Charity is the CTO and former CEO of Honeycomb. She has worked at Second Life, Parse, Facebook, and more. She blogs at charity.wtf.\nDave, Jamison, and Charity answer these questions:\nI\u2019ve had the role of tech lead informally for the past two years at a fast-growing tech startup. We were a team of 6 developers, and now we are 16. Recently, we had a department meeting in which the Software Development VP communicated that we have 3 teams and I was the tech lead of two of them. I was surprised. He hasn\u2019t mentioned his decision of splitting the teams nor that I\u2019ve been officially promoted to tech lead. I was expecting a one-on-one where he would \u201cpop the question\u201d: Will you be my tech lead?\nI asked him privately if that meant I would be officially promoted and would have my title changed. He said that he was going to have this conversation with the HR Manager and would get back to me, but potentially.\nHe doesn\u2019t spend time on one-on-ones, nor is he very good at managing people although he\u2019s good technically. How weird is this situation? A manager tells his team that they now have a tech lead along some org changes. I haven\u2019t been informed, haven\u2019t had my title changed yet, and haven\u2019t been offered a raise yet.\nHi! I love your show and have been listening to it almost since day one. I was an engineer for about 10 years, and I\u2019ve been a manager for about 1 year, and I love my team. They\u2019re high performers, we have a high level of trust. I also like my boss! But the larger org has some issues, and in time-honored Soft Skills Engineering tradition, I plan to quit. I would like to stay in management. So I have these questions:\n1) My employer is a very large public company. How much should I care about negative headlines and Wall Street\u2019s opinion?\n2) How long should I stay in my role as a manager before looking for a new job?\n3) How do I message this to my team when I leave?",

I feel undervalued at my current job and I am looking at other opportunities. Many recruiters approach me on LinkedIn with contract-to-hire positions. Usually this means the benefits are not as good as direct hire positions and that the company can just dispose of me when the contract is done (after 6 or 12 months, generally). Salaries seem to be higher when contracting, though.\nHave you ever worked as a contractor for a large company? Would you recommend it? How likely is it that companies use this type of employment as a way to temporarily hire somebody for a specific project and then get rid of them once it\u2019s done? What signs should I look for to avoid such companies? Does contracting actually make a difference? I live in Oregon, where employment is at-will anyway, so I can get fired at any time without any warning.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Hello, I\u2019m a mechanical engineer from Brazil. I really love your podcast. As a mechanical engineer I don\u2019t develop software but I believe the soft skills are important to everyone.\nI work in an American multinational company and I often talk or send e-mails to the engineers there. However, our culture is different so I don\u2019t know how to behave or how straightforward, informal or political I must be. I\u2019m always afraid of offending someone.

Well 8 years later, I\u2019m still stuck in QA and would love to move into development. I tried transferring within companies and applying to developer jobs, but the QA brand is holding me back. Any advice on how I can become a developer when I\u2019m pigeon-holed in QA?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Hi folks! I need your wisdom! Please help.\nTLDR: Senior as a Programmer, Junior as a Mobile developer.</p>\n\n    <p>When I first came to my job as an intern, my manager asked me what I wanted to do more - backend stuff, testing, or mobile development. I went randomly and chose the latter. It became my profile and I\u2019ve grown to really like it. Over the years, life has thrown me back and forth, I\u2019ve been on multiple different projects not related to mobile, so now I can do\u2026 everything? Or rather, nothing.\nI know a little bit about .NET, a little about web development, writing Visual Studio extensions, IoT, machine learning, Unity game dev.. This is good because  I can now quickly learn new things, know a lot of tricky stuff, know how to communicate with customers.

            "contentSnippet": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nHey guys, I\u2019ve graduated with a CS degree 8 years ago, but due to circumstances I accepted a QA job because I wasn\u2019t getting any other offers. Well 8 years later, I\u2019m still stuck in QA and would love to move into development. I tried transferring within companies and applying to developer jobs, but the QA brand is holding me back. Any advice on how I can become a developer when I\u2019m pigeon-holed in QA?\nHi folks! I need your wisdom! Please help.\nTLDR: Senior as a Programmer, Junior as a Mobile developer.\nWhen I first came to my job as an intern, my manager asked me what I wanted to do more - backend stuff, testing, or mobile development. I went randomly and chose the latter. It became my profile and I\u2019ve grown to really like it. Over the years, life has thrown me back and forth, I\u2019ve been on multiple different projects not related to mobile, so now I can do\u2026 everything? Or rather, nothing.\nI know a little bit about .NET, a little about web development, writing Visual Studio extensions, IoT, machine learning, Unity game dev.. This is good because  I can now quickly learn new things, know a lot of tricky stuff, know how to communicate with customers. I have a decent salary and good feedback.\nBut the huge downside to that is that I stayed exactly at the same level of mobile development as I was 3 years ago. I know basic stuff, a little bit of advanced stuff, but I have zero experience in all the \u201c\u201chot\u201d\u201d things like RxJava, Dagger, Kotlin.\nAll the job vacancies I\u2019ve seen require a strong knowledge of something particular: be it Android or iOS development, backend or frontend. I\u2019m suffering from a huge imposter syndrom - yes, I have all the \u201c\u201cgood\u201d\u201d programmer qualities, I\u2019m smart, but I have no advanced or even medium knowledge in anything.\nWhat can you advise me?\nHuge thanks and\u2026 love the show! \u2764",

I define rock star programmers as ones with ability to produce lots of code and implement features at a pace that dwarfs my own. In my last job, the RSP would constantly rewrite core libraries and I would have to figure out his design and rewrite my code to adapt to the new design multiple times.</p>\n\n    <p>In the current job, the RSP is very uncommunicative but with his sheer productivity steers the project into wild directions that are always coming as a surprise.

I define rock star programmers as ones with ability to produce lots of code and implement features at a pace that dwarfs my own. In my last job, the RSP would constantly rewrite core libraries and I would have to figure out his design and rewrite my code to adapt to the new design multiple times.\nIn the current job, the RSP is very uncommunicative but with his sheer productivity steers the project into wild directions that are always coming as a surprise.

One of them is the lead, and the other, is my peer. We all have a lot of respect for each others opinions and resolve our engineering disputes amicably.</p>\n\n    <p>My problem is that sometimes my peer will just give up saying \u201c\u201chave it your way\u201d\u201d etc. I want to have it out with him and evaluate each solution on its merits. I\u2019ve considered saying \u201c\u201cSTAND AND FIGHT YOU MANGY CUR\u201d\u201d, but then looked up \u201c\u201cMangy Cur\u201d\u201d and decided against it.</p>\n\n    <p>How do i get him to be more vocal about his opinions? (so that i can prove to him that i\u2019m right)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>I like the idea of measuring things, but I also feel like work \u201cmetrics\u201d are easy to game and hard to make indicative of actual quality work being done / product being produced.</p>\n\n    <p>In particular I worry when the data collected leads people to choose work that will bump stats rather than lead to better end user experiences / product / maintainable code.

            "contentSnippet": "This is a rerun of episode 87 from December 14, 2017.\nIn this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\n\u2018I\u2019ve been working on a project for the past year with two other senior developers. One of them is the lead, and the other, is my peer. We all have a lot of respect for each others opinions and resolve our engineering disputes amicably.\nMy problem is that sometimes my peer will just give up saying \u201c\u201chave it your way\u201d\u201d etc. I want to have it out with him and evaluate each solution on its merits. I\u2019ve considered saying \u201c\u201cSTAND AND FIGHT YOU MANGY CUR\u201d\u201d, but then looked up \u201c\u201cMangy Cur\u201d\u201d and decided against it.\nHow do i get him to be more vocal about his opinions? (so that i can prove to him that i\u2019m right)\nI like the idea of measuring things, but I also feel like work \u201cmetrics\u201d are easy to game and hard to make indicative of actual quality work being done / product being produced.\nIn particular I worry when the data collected leads people to choose work that will bump stats rather than lead to better end user experiences / product / maintainable code. What kind of data do you think is useful to collect in terms of developer activity? Can you share some examples of ways you\u2019ve been able to assess your own and your coworkers productivity?\nI\u2019m interested in this both on a team level and a personal one. How can I get better if I don\u2019t have a way to track what \u201cgood\u201d is for myself? Is trying to turn the complicated and messy thing that is what I actually do all day into a trackable, data driven domain a fool\u2019s errand?",

When we were negotiating the salary we agreed on amount X, and CTO promised that after a year it will be increased. He did say the exact sum. So, the year has passed, I followed up CTO about the salary raise, and he delegated the task to the manager, who decided not to give me a raise. When I asked \u2018why?\u2019 he said that I am good at negotiating my salary and I\u2019m getting what the market is offering. I don\u2019t feel bad about not getting more money, but the fact that the CTO break his word concerns me. I don\u2019t think I can trust this company when they are promising anything and I started to care less about what I\u2019m doing here.

He is rarely in his office and often states that he is \u201c\u201cworking\u201d\u201d from home. When he graces us with his appearance in the office, he asks the most basic questions. Granted, those questions are internal and specific (not easily Google-able), but still, I feel he should have known the answers after a year on the job.</p>\n\n    <p>He intentionally exploits our monolith\u2019s slow builds by running full builds all the time and complain that it is slow. Then plays video games in the office until the build is complete (about 4 hours). Then makes a minor change in his feature code and kicks off a full build again, even though he could build incrementally (about 2-3 minutes).</p>\n\n    <p>What do you recommend me to do?

Granted, those questions are internal and specific (not easily Google-able), but still, I feel he should have known the answers after a year on the job.\nHe intentionally exploits our monolith\u2019s slow builds by running full builds all the time and complain that it is slow. Then plays video games in the office until the build is complete (about 4 hours). Then makes a minor change in his feature code and kicks off a full build again, even though he could build incrementally (about 2-3 minutes).\nWhat do you recommend me to do? Should I spend time and energy to answer his lifeless questions? Should I confront him?",
