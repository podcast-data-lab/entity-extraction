A peaceful protest by detainees held in the Atlanta pen resulted in a violent crackdown, and one of the detainees, a man named Jose Hernandez-Mesa, was charged in federal court with inciting a riot. We tell the story of his trial \u2014 and the surprising verdict that began reshaping public opinion about the Mariel Cubans who were being detained.  <em>Want to hear the next episode of White Lies a week before everyone else?

And what became of them after? In season two of NPR's Pulitzer-finalist show, we unspool a decades-long story about immigration, indefinite detention, and a secret list.
