    "description": "A show about getting your best ideas into the world and seeing what happens. We talk about code, ops, infrastructure, and the people that make it happen.  Gerhard Lazu and friends explore all things DevOps, infra, and running apps in production. Whether you\u2019re cloud native, Kubernetes curious, a pro SRE, or just operating a VPS\u2026 you\u2019ll love coming along for the ride. Ship It honors the makers, the shippers, and the visionaries that see it through. Some people search for ShipIt or ShipItFM and can\u2019t find the show, so now the strings ShipIt and ShipItFM are in our description too. ",

This is the most significant improvement to our app\u2019s architecture in years, and now we have unlocked the next level: multi-cloud. We talk about that at length, and how it fits in our 2022 setup. The TL;DR is that changelog.com will fly, both literally and figuratively. We also address Steve\u2019s comment that he left on our previous Kaizen episode - thanks Steve! Towards the end, we talk about Gerhard\u2019s new beginnings at Dagger, where he gets to work with a world-class team and build the next-gen CI/CD. That\u2019s right, Gerhard is now walking the Ship It talk all day, every day. If you want to watch him code live, you can do so every Thursday, in our weekly community session. Kaizen! "

He was convinced that his Unifi Dream Machine Pro was not the issue. Drew helped Gerhard realise that it actually was. Not only has Gerhard\u2019s DNS latency improved by 3x, but he can now fail-over between two WAN connections.

We hope that they inspire you to setup a better home network. Most importantly, may you find your humble & brilliant Drew. ",

When Romano is not leading a team of 30 software engineers that specialise in operations, infrastructure and cloud, he is one of the organisers of DevOps Days Z\u00fcrich, and also the DevOps Meetup group, which is how Gerhard and Romano met in 2019. Having started his career as a .Net developer back in 2002, Romano had his fair share of dev and ops challenges, and he always enjoys seeing real business value delivered continuously in an automated way. In recent years, Romano\u2019s perspective broadened, and now he sees DevOps realities across many companies.

Not only did he take the time to understand how that happened, so that he could actually learn from his mistake, but now we have a system in place so that we can share learnings from incidents. By the way, these are publicly available in our #incidents Slack channel. A great & unexpected thing that happened since we recorded this episode, is Jerod fixing 99% of all the errors that were happening in prod.

Docs play an essential role in GitHub Actions, and Gerhard\u2019s experience has proven that. Building, testing, and shipping code with GitHub Actions works better because of their excellent docs. However, the docs that Kathy pictures are not what you are imagining. She explains it best in her post, Maybe it\u2019s time we re-think docs, which is what started this whole conversation. The bottom line is, just as you wouldn\u2019t ship untested code, shipping code without documentation is not optional. Today\u2019s conversation with Kathy explains why.",

Many things changed since then, such as abstractions and compositions, as well as using Crossplane to build platforms, which were mostly ideas. Fast forward 18 months, 2k changes, as well as a major version, and Crossplane is now an easy choice - some would say the best choice - for platform teams to declare what infrastructure means to them. You can now use Crossplane to define your infrastructure abstractions across multiple vendors, including AWS, GCP & Equinix Metal. The crazy ideas from 2019 are now bold and within reach.
