The technology would help local governments enforce mask mandates, but is it worth it?\n\nThanks to evolution, human faces are much more variable than other body parts. In the words of one researcher, \u201cIt's like evolving a name tag.\u201d\n\nMost people have difficulty accurately recognizing strangers. But a few individuals\u2014called super-recognizers\u2014excel at the task. London police have employed some of these people to help find criminal suspects.\n\u00a0\nAnd for subscribers:\u00a0\nArtificial intelligence and robotics have been improving rapidly. Our cover story from September 2020 explores the latest robotic technology from around the world.\u00a0\nIn 1976 Isaac Asimov wrote an article for National Geographic predicting how humans might live in 2026.\n\u00a0\nAlso explore:\u00a0\nTake a look at the documentary Coded Bias, featuring AI researcher Joy Buolamwini.
