No.\nIt's the very same question that has bounced around the minds of believers and skeptics for thousands of years.\n\u2014\nWith Passion City Online you can join us every Sunday for gatherings at 10a + 1p + 5p + 8p, as well as learn more about Passion City Church, our beliefs, leadership and culture by joining us for Welcome to Church!

However, most of us realize that we aren\u2019t going to fulfill our God-designed destiny alone. That\u2019s why we are inviting every man to join a Fight Club, a group of 3-5 men who meet together on a consistent basis to spur one another on as we fight in four arenas: 1. We want to fight for our walk with God. 2. We want to fight for our heart and character. 3. We want to fight for our family (and future family). 4. We want to fight for our brother. Afterall, scripture teaches that we have a spiritual Enemy who is warring against us in each of these arenas, and we are confident that a Fight Club is our best defense in the battle. \u2014 If you are interested in joining a FIGHT CLUB, visit https://passioncitychurch.com/fightclub/</p>\n",

There will be times when life isn't working out; when you fail; when disappointment and destructive thinking get the better of you. These are the critical moments where our minds become battlefields and the stakes are so high. \u2014 \u201cBrothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead.\u201d Philippians 3:13 \u2014 This week, ZOE CHURCH Pastor, Chad Veach, has a message for each of us; it is always too early to quit, and it is never too late to start. Don't give up, press on into your giftings and dreams, after all, we serve the God who sees us as who we are supposed to be, and who is calling us into the plans He has for us.",
