So will the current artificial intelligence boom push humans even further out of the customer support game? Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Christina McAllister, a senior analyst at Forrester who works on customer service research and strategy. She says: &#8220;Not so fast.&#8221;</p>\n"

Advertisers pay to get their sites at the top of search results, have their businesses show up on digital maps or populate their products at the top of shopping carousel pages. The search engine companies are not only paid, but get data about what users want, which they can then turn around and use to sell more advertising. But how does all this work if, as chat-based artificial intelligence permeates web search, the results become less like a big list and more like a one-on-one conversation? That&#8217;s where it looks like Microsoft and Google are headed with their Bing and Bard chatbots. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Garrett Johnson, assistant professor of marketing at Boston University, about how this new approach could really shake up the online ad space.</p>\n"
