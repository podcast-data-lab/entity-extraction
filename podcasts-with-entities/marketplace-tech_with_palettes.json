What they found was a site crawling with misinformation: images captured months or years earlier in unrelated attacks, inaccurate claims about other countries entering the conflict, even a fake White House press release announcing billions of dollars in new U.S. aid to Israel made the rounds. And X&#8217;s owner, Elon Musk, promoting accounts known for spreading lies and hate didn&#8217;t help. The signal-to-noise ratio on X is worse than ever, said David Clinch, a founding partner of the social media intelligence agency Storyful and co-founder of Media Growth Partners. Marketplace&#8217;s Lily Jamali spoke with Clinch about what X users should remember when scrolling through the platform for news on the Israel-Hamas situation.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
