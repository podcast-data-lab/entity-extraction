And the device says, \u201cWould you like a recipe for chicken soup?\u201d And then, \u201cBy the way, would you like to order cough drops with one-hour delivery?\u201d This is the scenario laid out in one of Amazon\u2019s patents. And it shows how voice recognition technology could be used to learn things about us, beyond the words we say to our devices. Like whether we&#8217;re sick or depressed. Marketplace&#8217;s Amy Scott speaks with Joe Turow, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who writes about all of this in his new book \u201cThe Voice Catchers: How Marketers Listen In to Exploit Your Feelings, Your Privacy, and Your Wallet.&#8221;</p>\n"

Against the backdrop of the United Nations climate summit this week, where more than 40 world leaders have pledged to work together to bring down the cost of green technology, we&#8217;ll hear more about one of those solutions: batteries. Batteries are key to getting off fossil fuels. And a mineral called lithium is a key ingredient in those batteries. In this episode, Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Molly about what&#8217;s happening near California&#8217;s Salton Sea.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
