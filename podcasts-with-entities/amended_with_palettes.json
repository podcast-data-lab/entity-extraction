    "description": "Sex was never the only battleground for women\u2019s voting rights. Amended, a podcast from Humanities New York, marks the centennial of the 19th Amendment by challenging the suffrage story most Americans learn in school. Host Laura Free, a historian of women and politics, and her guests take us back to the 1800's and up to the present day to tell the stories of under-recognized women who also fought injustice based on race, citizenship status and class.",

Ineligible for U.S. citizenship due to anti-Chinese immigration policy, Mabel nonetheless spoke out for American women\u2019s political equality. She envisioned a world where all women had the right to vote\u2014and she wanted white suffragists to pay attention to the discrimination and racism faced by Chinese American women.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, producer Reva Goldberg travels to Chinatown to meet with Reverend Bayer Lee, who honors Mabel\u2019s legacy as the pastor of the church community that Mabel and her parents dedicated themselves to building. Host Laura Free speaks with Dr. Cathleen Cahill, author of Recasting the Vote: How Women of Color Transformed the Suffrage Movement, to learn about Mabel\u2019s political goals for women and for China. In the end, it\u2019s clear that Mabel Lee forged a bold life according to her values.\n\nFor a transcript and more about this series, visit amendedpodcast.com.

                "summary": "On March 25, 1911, a fire swept through the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City, claiming the lives of 146 workers. Most of the victims were young immigrant women from Eastern and Southern Europe. In the wake of the fire, a group of women labor activists fought to ensure that the tragedy led to concrete change.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode, host Laura Free speaks with Dr. Annelise Orleck, author of Common Sense and a Little Fire, to learn about the women who agitated for better working conditions before and after the Triangle Fire. Rose Schneiderman, Pauline Newman, and Clara Lemlich had a shared vision for a more equitable society. Together, they organized unions, led strikes, and fought for labor legislation, combating sexist and classist attitudes every step of the way. To exercise their full political power, they needed to make an impact not just on the picket lines but also at the ballot box. They needed the right to vote.\n\nFor a transcript and more about this series, visit amendedpodcast.com.

And who gets left out?\u00a0\n\nOur host is Laura Free, a historian of women and politics. She reflects on the suffrage story she learned as a child, one that centers a few white women. She speaks with historians Bettye Collier-Thomas and Lisa Tetrault about the work they\u2019ve done to show there is much more to the story. Next, Laura travels to Seneca Falls, New York, site of the 1848 women\u2019s rights convention, with guest Judith Wellman. Dr. Wellman describes a movement that was both complex and diverse, and helps us to see an old story in an entirely new light.\n\nThis episode serves as the prologue to the series, inviting listeners to amend their understanding of women\u2019s suffrage history.\u00a0\n\nFor a transcript and more about this series, visit amendedpodcast.com.\u00a0\n\nOur Team\nLaura Free, Host & Writer\nReva Goldberg, Producer, Editor & Co-Writer\nScarlett Rebman, Project Director\nKordell K.
