                "summary": "Marc Maron (stand-up comedian, host of WTF with Marc Maron podcast, actor, author) joins us to break down the arc of grief, the effects of growing up with detached parents, and his journey toward sobriety and defining himself. We discuss Marc\u2019s foray into podcasting, how it enabled a generation of podcasters including MBB, and how his show has evolved over time. He reflects on his past struggles with alcohol and drugs including \"cocaine psychosis\", his experiences with rehab and therapy, and the positives and negatives of groups like AA. Maron explains how his mother influenced his disordered eating, his father\u2019s narcissism and recent dementia diagnosis, and how his parents\u2019 struggles denied him a fundamental sense of self. He reveals why he thinks he may have had undiagnosed borderline personality disorder, why he chooses to be so revealing in his creative pursuits, and the dangers of early exposure to adult content. Maron opens up about the sudden passing of his girlfriend Lynn Shelton, his inevitable attempt at using humor to relieve his pain, the interconnectedness of grief, the importance of showing up in his state of raw grief for his loyal audience, and the sense of comfort and control he has felt from sharing this experience. He considers his shortcomings as a romantic partner, what he got right with Lynn, and his take on separating the art from the artist."

                "summary": "Max Greenfield (New Girl, The Neighborhood, Veronica Mars, Ugly Betty) stops by for a spontaneous chat with Mayim and Jonathan! He opens up about how feeling alone led to addiction, connecting with others brought him to recovery, and how getting a rescue dog changed his life. Max and Mayim discuss their wildly popular shofar performance on The Late Late Show with James Corden and their love of basketball, and Max reveals why he thinks Mayim doesn\u2019t like to be spontaneous. They discuss the challenges that come with progressive parenting as individuals who were raised under an authoritarian parenting style, the importance of consistency in parenting, and how Max\u2019s spirituality provided a good parenting foundation. Mayim and Jonathan explain the importance of checking in with yourself and being accountable to yourself and others, especially in recovery."

She not only provides great, practical parenting tips, but also helps us understand our own upbringings, how they impact our lives into adulthood, and provides insight into why our parents did the things they did. Dr. Becky discusses why she found the best way to work with children was actually working with their parents through body-based approaches to psychotherapy, her own paradigm shift in parenting styles, and the differences between attachment parenting and helicopter parenting. She explains the importance of wiring kids for resilience with self-soothing techniques in order to ditch old patterns of behavior, building skills to manage emotions through validation, and how to provide kids with tools to process difficult emotions. Mayim and Dr. Becky define reflective listening, boundaries vs consequences, and how feeling alone can lead to shame and fears of abandonment. They discuss the benefits of learning to embody your authority as a parent, ways to provide structure to a child with anxiety, and the benefits of internal family systems (IFS) therapy.

Mayim and Dr. Huberman discuss the neuroscience behind acting and mimicry, the physical symptoms of workaholism, and the correlation between dopamine, focus, and motivation. They consider the use of self-hypnosis to regulate your internal state, the negative side effects of social media on our physical bodies, and what the deprivation of healthy physical connection can lead to. They explain ways to control adrenaline to benefit us in times of crisis, the relationship between our eyes and our internal state, and the origins of EMDR and clinical hypnosis.\nHuberman Lab Podcast: https://hubermanlab.com/category/podcast-episodes/\n\nBialikBreakdown.com\nYouTube.com/mayimbialik",

He discusses ways to create distance between you and your suffering, how to reach a state of unconditional love and spiritual growth, and provides practical examples of how to surrender one\u2019s ego.

She opens up about the awakening she experienced while lying on the floor of a halfway house while being treated for disordered eating, and how that revelation allowed her to overcome depression and suicidal thoughts, while reshaping every area of her life. Byron guides us through the practice of identifying and questioning thoughts that can lead to personal suffering and explains how our underlying beliefs may unknowingly fuel our emotions.

They discuss the ways food intolerances can lead to disordered eating and how to fix those intolerances, the mental health impact of dietary challenges, and empowering oneself with information about one\u2019s specific dietary needs."

He walks us through his coming out journey, from depression and suicidal thoughts stemming from questioning his sexuality through the reactions of his family, friends, and fans upon releasing his extremely popular coming out video on YouTube. Connor explains the ways he has attempted to distract himself from his inner conflicts, the ways in which mental health serves as a touchpoint for every area of his life, and why he hit another depressive spiral after coming out and achieving career success. Mayim and Connor bond over their struggles to balance mental wellness with being public personas, and they consider the disproportionate amount of mental health struggles faced by the LGBTQIA+ community. They discuss the physical effects of suppression, the evolution of the emerging field of content creation, and the importance of putting in the work to tackle mental health struggles.
