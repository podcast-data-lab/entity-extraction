There\u2019s something happening here that\u2019s so incredibly sweet but also so mournful.\u201d \u00a0In this episode, Christopher Wheeldon talks about how he discovered Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev after seeing his first ballet, Romeo and Juliet, at the Royal Opera House. He later fell in love with Prokofiev's\u00a0Second Violin Concerto, wearing out a cassette tape of it in the process of playing it over and over. The music stuck with him for years to come, and though he\u2019d abandoned previous attempts to create a ballet for it, once Wheeldon started his own company, he finally felt able to choreograph for the music he\u2019d connected with so strongly as a child. Christopher Wheeldon is a Tony-Award winning choreographer. His work includes\u00a0An American in Paris, the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games and the minimalist ballet After The Rain, which inspired the Open Ears episode by Megan Reid.\u00a0 \u2028Did you like the track Christopher chose?

When he first heard the piece it seemed like cacophony, but repeat listenings (and\u00a0seeing it used\u00a0in Disney's\u00a0Fantasia) gave him an understanding of how the composer was playing with form and narrative and upsetting expectations \u2014 ideas Jon would go on to incorporate into his own music.
