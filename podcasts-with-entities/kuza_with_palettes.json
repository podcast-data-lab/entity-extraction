Lately, there has been hardly a day without an item on the local news about abuse and violence amongst family members. Categories of family abuse include both gender-based violence and child abuse. These can be in the forms of physical violence, emotional abuse, sexual violation, or all of the above. Though you may have gone through traumatic experiences with your family, remind yourself that you belong to a much greater family. God does not and will not abuse his children.<br /><br />Link to The Blog: <a href=\"https://kuzaapp.com/surviving-abusive-families/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://kuzaapp.com/surviving-abusive-families/</a><br />Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kuzaapp\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/kuzaapp</a><br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kuzaapp\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/kuzaapp</a><br />Tik Tok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.tiktok.com/</a>@kuzaapp"
