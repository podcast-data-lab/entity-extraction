    "description": "Paulina Stevens grew up in an insular Romani American family, destined to leave school, marry young, and become a fortuneteller. By 17, her fate was sealed \u2014 until she decided to leave it all behind. \"Foretold\" follows Paulina as she navigates the consequences of her decision to leave her community and redefine her identity. Hosted by Los Angeles Times reporter Faith Pinho, \"Foretold\" will take you past the neon \"psychic\" signs and trendy tarot cards to unravel myths and stereotypes that have followed the Romani people for centuries.",

By 17, her fate was sealed \u2014 until she decided to leave it all behind. \"Foretold\" follows Paulina as she navigates the consequences of her decision to leave her community and redefine her identity. Hosted by Los Angeles Times reporter Faith Pinho, \"Foretold\" will take you past the neon \"psychic\" signs and trendy tarot cards to unravel myths and stereotypes that have followed the Romani people for centuries."
