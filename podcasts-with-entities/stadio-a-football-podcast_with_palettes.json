                "summary": "Musa and Ryan round up the midweek games, starting with the Women\u2019s Champions League, where Arsenal escaped a scare against Hoffenheim, and Barcelona, Bayern, and Lyon won big (10:00). It\u2019s then on to the Premier League (13:44), where Manchester City hit seven past Leeds, Arsenal went fourth after beating West Ham (20:34), and Aston Villa continue to impress under Steven Gerrard (28:05), before a very quick Bundesliga summary (30.46). Finally, there are questions about Southampton (35:21), Everton (41:55), grumpy-old-man football opinions (46:14), and who is the footballing equivalent of Steph Curry (47.56).\n\nHosts: Musa Okwonga and Ryan Hunn\n\nProducer: Ryan Hunn\n\nAssociate Producer: Erika Cervantes\nLearn more about your ad choices.

But first, there\u2019s a round-up of the other big results from the weekend (6:45), with Wolfsburg beating Frankfurt in the Frauen Pokalfinale and Barcelona completing the treble after their Copa de la Reina win over Levante. Plus, they discuss some promotion news around Europe, Zidane\u2019s letter to the Real Madrid fans, and Cruz Azul finally breaking their Liga MX curse (21:02). Then, it\u2019s on to the Champions League final, including what is was like watching two of the best tactical minds in Pep Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel go head-to-head in a thriller, and highlight some key individual performances (25:21).\n\nHosts: Musa Okwonga and Ryan Hunn\nAdditional Production Assistance: Isaiah Blakely\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Meanwhile, Chelsea\u2019s Champions League final opponent, Barcelona, did secure the Primera title with eight games to go (14:04) and the Portland Thorns won the NSWL Challenge Cup (16:15). On the men\u2019s side, Bayern secured their ninth straight Bundesliga title thanks to Dortmund\u2019s win over RB Leipzig, which also moved Dortmund into the Champions League places. Plus, they discuss some other talking points around the league (17:31). The next stop is the Premier League, where Thomas Tuchel landed another blow to Pep Guardiola's side (27:41) and Newcastle and Everton won big matches (41:37). Meanwhile, nobody wants to win La Liga (49:03), Juventus slip out of the Serie A Champions League places (52:53) and PSG lose ground to Lille in Ligue 1 (54:48).\nHosts: Musa Okwonga and Ryan Hunn\nAdditional Production Assistance: Isaiah Blakely\nLearn more about your ad choices.
