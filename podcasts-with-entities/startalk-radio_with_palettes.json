Get ready to spend some time pondering time, because in this episode of StarTalk, host Neil deGrasse Tyson is joined by co-host J. Richard Gott, author of <em>Time Travel in Einstein's Universe</em> and an expert in exotic astrophysics. Join us as we explore time travel, black holes, and worm holes, and analyze some Hollywood time travel films in terms of their scientific accuracy. Rich enlightens us on the fact that time travel is mathematically possible, citing Einstein\u2019s Theory of Special Relativity to explain the phenomenon. In fact, there\u2019s some time travel going on in the recording studio when Rich explains that Neil is seeing him as he was 3 billionths of a second before\u2026maybe solving the secret to looking younger? Next up on the space-time continuum is the question of whether gravity effects time travel. Rich tells us that on a planet like Mercury, whose gravitational pull from the Sun is so strong, time ticks slower. You\u2019ll hear some discussion about the accuracy of the movie <em>The Time Machine</em>, and how building a time machine like they did, as long as it uses the mass of Jupiter, just may give us enough energy to travel forward in time to find out the results of the next election! Another way to travel through time may be to orbit a black hole, but Rich warns us against getting too close to the point of no return unless we want to be spaghettified. You\u2019ll also hear a little about Hollywood\u2019s take on time travel depicted in <em>Back to the Future</em>, as well as in <em>Planet of the Apes,</em> for which Rich suggests that the first clue that time travel had occurred should have been that the apes were speaking English. The episode gets even more interesting when Neil and Rich take phone calls from fans. They answer questions about the expansion of space, seeing back in time through modern telescopes, and how the fabric of space stretches faster than the speed of light. Investigate wormholes, curved spacetime, general relativity, and all that cosmic craziness. Even crazier, though, may be when Neil recalls a strange memory of being confused for Michael Jackson when he was a kid, sparking his curiosity about whether MJ could\u2019ve traveled back in time to get his old nose back? Rich says that even though we can travel into the past, we can\u2019t age in reverse. Ponder the Grandmother Paradox, and whether time travellers have the ability to change the past. Finally, a fan asks how the past, present, and future coincide with the continuum of time.

            "content": "<p>Have you ever wondered why the sky is blue? We have too, and so we\u2019re giving you the long-awaited answer, along with more exploration into the mysterious celestial sphere up above. It\u2019s above our heads every day, conveying its lightest and darkest moments, giving hints about the universe around us, and allowing us to learn by looking up\u2026but<strong> </strong>are we really looking? In this episode of StarTalk, host Neil deGrasse Tyson is joined by co-host and comedian Lynne Koplitz to ponder the many questions, stories, legends, and phenomena of the sky. But first, we just can\u2019t talk about the sky without \u201cBill Nye the Sky Guy.\u201d We hear a little from Bill about Jupiter\u2019s opposition to the Sun during summer, and the importance of stargazing, as he encourages us to make some time for the sky in our lives. Next on the horizon, Neil and Lynne dig through ancient legends of the night sky, as they invite us to imagine the sky as \u201cCave TV\u201d before we had the real thing. Neil educates us on the meaning of the word \u201cPlanet\u201d in ancient Greek, and Lynne discovers a mistake that may have been the reason all of her wishes on stars haven\u2019t come true. You\u2019ll also hear why marrying an astronomer means you\u2019ll always know where they are at night\u2026like a bartender. The second half of the show gets even more fascinating when \u201cAstronomer Extraordinaire\u201d and News 12 Meteorologist Joe Rao takes a seat. Joe, the ultimate sky expert, answers questions even Neil can\u2019t answer concerning the sky during eclipses, hurricanes, rainbows, shooting stars, the brightest skies of summer, the white skies of winter, and everything in between. Joe also debunks the assumption that you must look away or even stay inside during a total eclipse, while highlighting that the moment of total eclipse is actually the only point when it is safe to look. He tells us about the Great American Eclipse on August 21st, 2017 (In fact, Joe was also our guest on \u201cCosmic Queries: The Great American Eclipse\u201d the week before it happened!) And before we end, there\u2019s revelation in the air (and a little precipitation) when we unearth the \u201cCreepy Cloud\u201d, A.K.A the Mammatus Cloud, one that was seen over CitiField (shown above) after a heavy thunderstorm that lit up the sky. Feeling enlightened? There\u2019s more where that came from.
