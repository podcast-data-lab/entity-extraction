Perkins\u2019 story moves from confusion to clarity, and ultimately ends in resolve and redemption. Having grown up in poverty, Perkins found hope in the promises of God, and he took them to heart. But he didn\u2019t just take the good stuff to heart. He also took to heart the challenges and warnings scripture had for both him and his world. In his later years, Perkins demonstrates a distinct comfort with the kinds of tensions we find in scripture: between repentance and hope, justice and forgiveness. In 1960, Perkins and his wife Vira Mae moved from California, back to Mendenhall, Mississippi to put into practice his philosophy of what it means to minister to the poor. Though he spent much of his energy implementing a daycare center, a church, a youth program, and many other benevolent programs, in his community, Perkins also took a prominent role among ongoing Civil Rights activism. As a result, he built up his community while also running into a host of physical push-back, oftentimes being imprisoned and even beaten for his beliefs and actions. Along with his wife, he started a foundation dedicated to justice, reconciliation, and community development. Now 88 years old, he\u2019s focused on clarifying and documenting the experience and wisdom he\u2019s developed over the years. In the final episode of CT\u2019s The Calling, host Richard Clark talks with Perkins about his experience growing up in the midst of unjust laws, the double-edged sword of forgiveness, and his fear of falling short of faithfulness in the end.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Perkins\u2019 story moves from confusion to clarity, and ultimately ends in resolve and redemption. Having grown up in poverty, Perkins found hope in the promises of God, and he took them to heart. But he didn\u2019t just take the good stuff to heart. He also took to heart the challenges and warnings scripture had for both him and his world. In his later years, Perkins demonstrates a distinct comfort with the kinds of tensions we find in scripture: between repentance and hope, justice and forgiveness. In 1960, Perkins and his wife Vira Mae moved from California, back to Mendenhall, Mississippi to put into practice his philosophy of what it means to minister to the poor. Though he spent much of his energy implementing a daycare center, a church, a youth program, and many other benevolent programs, in his community, Perkins also took a prominent role among ongoing Civil Rights activism.

In a recent conversation with CT, Gudgel had the opportunity to reflect on what working on films like The Ordinance has taught him about how churches can share their experiences.

Whether serving as lead pastor for Tampa\u2019s multi-ethnic, multi-generational Crossover Church, performing hip-hop and spoken word concerts around the world, or writing books like Un.orthodox or ReBuild, Kyllonen has spent the last 20 years in ministry venture after ministry venture, bringing the gospel into every available nook and cranny of the city he calls home.

For instance, while he\u2019s been at the forefront of cultivating a hip-hop-friendly culture at Crossover, he\u2019s also learned the hard way that when a church copies the world\u2019s culture rather than creating one of its own, it can lead to confusion over what that church is really all about.

There may be few people more qualified to answer that question today than Katelyn Beaty, the managing editor of Christianity Today\u2019s print magazine. As both the first woman and the youngest person to hold her position, Beaty is no stranger to breaking new ground for women\u2014and she encourages others to do so not only in her work as founder and editor of CT\u2019s Her.meneutics blog, but also in her newly published book A Woman\u2019s Place, released just yesterday. But success and influence have come with their share of challenges for Beaty. As an evangelical arguing for a broader inclusion of women in public life, she\u2019s drawn criticism from all sides for her nuanced approach to the issue of women in leadership. At the same time, she\u2019s struggled with a church dating culture that doesn\u2019t always value women\u2019s professional achievements. On this week\u2019s episode of The Calling, join CT managing editor Richard Clark as Beaty tells him about taking the helm of CT\u2019s print magazine, the pivotal role that chicken fingers played in her choice of colleges, and how women can embrace their wide-ranging, world-changing callings.\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "Callings come in many forms\u2014a moment of epiphany, a wise word from a mentor, a quiet prayer before an altar. Dan Claire\u2019s came when the Rapture failed to happen. A fifth-generation Floridian who dropped out of medical school to pursue ministry, Claire pastors the Church of the Resurrection (affectionately nicknamed \u201cRez\u201d) in Capitol Hill, where he\u2019s served since moving to Washington, D.C. 17 years ago. Before going to seminary, though, he was a student ministry leader at the University of Florida\u2014at a time when Christians in his town were busy preparing for Christ\u2019s imminent second coming. If you\u2019ve also been left behind, then it may be the perfect time to listen to this week\u2019s episode of The Calling, where you\u2019ll hear CT managing editor Richard Clark chat with Dan Claire about being a med school dropout, getting ordained in the Rwandan church, and the challenges he faces pastoring a transient congregation in the heart of the nation\u2019s capitol. Trust us . . . it\u2019ll be (ahem) rapturous.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices"

(And if that sounds awkward, trust us, he knows.) An author, theologian, and pastor of The Summit Church of Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, Greear is one of those rare birds who is so passionate about evangelism that he\u2019ll take almost any opportunity to strike up a biblical back-and-forth\u2014even if, by his own admission, he crashes and burns as often as not. You might think that someone with that much ministerial fire tends to shoot first and aim second\u2014\u201cthe fields are ripe for harvest,\u201d after all. In fact, though, Greear is a big fan of waiting. Whether he\u2019s helping young college students plan for their futures or writing about how churches stand to \u201cgain by losing,\u201d Greear always tempers his missionary fervor with the knowledge that God\u2019s work often involves long periods of preparation. It\u2019s part of why he thinks the years people send in seminary are worthwhile. On this week\u2019s episode of The Calling, Greear sits down with CT manging editor Richard Clark to discuss his latest book, running for president of the Southern Baptist Convention, and why the Holy Spirit is better than having Jesus as your senior pastor.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Over the course of seventeen years of ministry, Wilson has used his entrepreneurial know-how to create a raft of organizations, systems, and publications designed to help leaders find their \u201csweet spot\u201d and provide local churches with tools for deep-rooted, multiplication-driven growth. Before all that, though, Wilson was up to something else entirely: nuclear engineering. In fact, he worked for the Division of Naval Reactors for a full fifteen years before feeling a call to full-time ministry\u2014a call that emerged, he says, from an early and prolonged midlife crisis. In this week\u2019s episode of The Calling, join CT managing editor Richard Clark as he chats with Wilson about his entrepreneurial calling, how to keep your vocation from overwhelming your life, and what aircraft carriers have to teach us about the church\u2019s mission.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
