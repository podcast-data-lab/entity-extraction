As King of the universe, we need to seek Him base on His terms, not our own. \\n\\nWhen sin entered the world, it separated humanity from our Creator, and in the garden of Eden, the first animal was sacrificed by God to clothe Adam and Eve. Sacrificial blood was needed to allow their sinful bodies to be able to handle being near to the purity and holiness of God. In turn, desiring and wanting to live amongst His people, God later gave the Israelites specific rules and laws to obey in order to be protected in His presence.\\n\\nWhen King David came to power in Israel, he desired to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant from where it lay abandoned and disregarded for years in the outskirts of the kingdom. While his passion was strong, he failed to seek God in the ways that He had instructed in the Law of Moses. As a result, when Uzzah\u2019s sinful hands touched the Ark, he died on the spot. Instead of repenting for seeking God in his own way, and not the Father\u2019s way, David left the Ark the in the hands of Obed Edom, and fled in fear.\\n\\nObed Edom was a man with no great inheritance or status, but he sought the Lord with obedience and reverence, and as a result, his house, family, and generations to come, were blessed. After getting wind of the blessings Obed Edom had received through properly hosting the presence of the Lord, King David repented and brought the Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem. By preparing a place for the Ark to rest, making sure the Levites were consecrated and in charge of its transport, sacrificing the animals necessary for atonement, and even wearing a linen ephod instead of a crown on the journey, David declared God was the true King and not him. \\n\\nToday, to seek the Lord as He desires to be sought, we need to remember that God is holy, perfect, and set apart, accept Jesus Christ\u2019s blood atonement, desire the wholeness of His Holy presence, choose to live on His terms, and rejoice in the blessing of His presence. Our bodies are His temple, meaning the Ark of the Covenant is no longer needed, because and we have Holy Spirit dwelling inside of us. May we consecrate our hearts and bodies to His holiness so that the cry of our heart, home, church and region ushers in the revival we long for.\"}\" data-sheets-userformat= \"{\"2\":769,\"3\":{\"1\":0},\"11\":4,\"12\":0}\"> so that the cry of our heart, home, church, and region ushers in the revival we long for.</span></span></p>",
