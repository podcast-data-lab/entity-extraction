    "description": "A show about getting your best ideas into the world and seeing what happens. We talk about code, ops, infrastructure, and the people that make it happen.  Gerhard Lazu and friends explore all things DevOps, infra, and running apps in production. Whether you\u2019re cloud native, Kubernetes curious, a pro SRE, or just operating a VPS\u2026 you\u2019ll love coming along for the ride. Ship It honors the makers, the shippers, and the visionaries that see it through. Some people search for ShipIt or ShipItFM and can\u2019t find the show, so now the strings ShipIt and ShipItFM are in our description too. ",

                "summary": "Today Gerhard shares the entire story behind his lost packets. He is talking with Drew Marshall, director at Trunk Networks and No One Internet, a Cloud Services Provider & ISP based in Sussex, UK. Gerhard\u2019s Vodafone ISP gateway was losing packets, and recording some of the previous episodes used to be challenging as his internet connection would cut out up to 10 seconds at a time, multiple times per recording session. He was convinced that his Unifi Dream Machine Pro was not the issue. Drew helped Gerhard realise that it actually was. Not only has Gerhard\u2019s DNS latency improved by 3x, but he can now fail-over between two WAN connections. And because nothing beats a real-world experiment, you can guess what is coming in this episode \ud83d\ude09 You will find latency & packet loss graphs, speed test runs, and a few other interestings in the show notes. We hope that they inspire you to setup a better home network. Most importantly, may you find your humble & brilliant Drew. "

                "summary": "This is our third Kaizen episode in which Adam, Jerod & Gerhard talk about GitOps the wrong way, ask questions with Honeycomb and realise that they must be holding the CDN wrong, and the effort that has been going into moving all changelog.com static files from regular volumes to an S3-like object store. If you like a good yak shake, listening to this one is a lot more fun than doing it. Gerhard is most excited about the Ship It Christmas gifts that we have been preparing for you. While GitHub Codespaces is not going to be part of the upcoming Christmas special episode, today\u2019s talk covers why investing in a Codespaces integration is worth it. Changelog #459 and Backstage #20 are related to this topic. "

            "contentSnippet": "This week Gerhard is chatting with Romano Roth, Head of DevOps at Z\u00fchlke, a company founded by Gerhard Z\u00fchlke in 1968. Nowadays they help companies all over the world build, ship and run anything from factory robots, to AI assistants in complex regulatory environments, and even medical devices that perform autonomous robotic surgery. When Romano is not leading a team of 30 software engineers that specialise in operations, infrastructure and cloud, he is one of the organisers of DevOps Days Z\u00fcrich, and also the DevOps Meetup group, which is how Gerhard and Romano met in 2019. Having started his career as a .Net developer back in 2002, Romano had his fair share of dev and ops challenges, and he always enjoys seeing real business value delivered continuously in an automated way. In recent years, Romano\u2019s perspective broadened, and now he sees DevOps realities across many companies. If you are curious about what good DevOps looks like, and what are the real challenges, then Romano has some good insights for you.",
