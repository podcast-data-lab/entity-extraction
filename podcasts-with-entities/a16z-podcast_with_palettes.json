In the centuries to come, work was revolutionized, with perhaps the most well-known inflection of Ford Motors adopting the 40-hour work week in 1926. The cubicle? We have Robert Propst to thank for that, entering the picture in 1968.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the 80s when the Internet appeared on the scene and wifi released in 1997, forever changing the way people live and work. Since then, companies have continued to adopt many of the practices from the 20th century, despite the possibilities being fundamentally different.</p><p>COVID sent a shock into that system, forcing many people to adopt a distributed model and despite much debate about what the future holds, this episode will highlight the many ways that companies are continuing to adapt.</p><p>Will companies shift toward more asynchronous work?

This is obvious on the individual level \u2013 how you order goods, the way you chat with friends, and the news you consume\u2026 all from a handheld computer. It\u2019s also becoming more obvious at the company level. The pandemic shook the world into remote work and many companies have decided that maybe work can be done in ways they never imagined.

            "contentSnippet": "When you hear stories about Amazon's \"invention machine\" -- which led to a company with not just one or two products but several successful diverse lines of business -- we often hear about things like: Memos, six pages exactly and no powerpoints at all!; or, the idea of just \"work backwards from the press release\"; and other such \"best practices\"... But what's often lost in hearing about these is the context and the details behind them -- the what, the how (as well as their origin stories) -- not to mention how they all fit together. Knowing this can give us insight into\u00a0 how all companies and leaders, not just Amazon and Bezos, can define their cultures and ways especially as they scale. After all, Amazon was once a small startup, too.\nSo in this a16z Podcast with Sonal Chokshi -- the very first podcast for the new book Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon (out February 9) -- authors Colin Bryar and Bill Carr share not only how Amazon did it, but how other companies can do it, too, drawing on their combined 27 years of firsthand observations and experiences from being in \"the room\" where it happens. Bill was vice president of digital media, founded and led Amazon Music, Amazon Video, Amazon Studios; and Colin started out in the software group, was a technical vice president, and then, notably, was one of Jeff Bezos' earliest shadows -- the shadow before him was in fact Andy Jassy, president and CEO of Amazon Web Services (soon to be CEO of Amazon).\nThe two share not only the early inside stories behind (ultimately) big business moves like AWS, Kindle, Prime -- but more importantly, the leadership principles, decision making practices, AND operational processes that got them there. Because \"working backwards\" is much, much more than being obsessed with your customers, or having company values like \"are right a lot\u201d, \"insist on the highest standards\", \"think big\", \"bias for action\", and more. The discussion also touches on hot-topic debates like to lean-MVP-or-not-to-be; the internal API economy; do you even need a chief product officer; and if you need less, not more, coordination as you grow. Can startups really be like Amazon? Yes: and it comes down to how leaders, organizations, and people at all levels decide, build, invent... using the power of narratives and more.\n---\nThe views expressed here are those of the AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

But how did they know it was the same group? And why was it not quite the perfect crime?\nimage: Heliophysics Systems Observatory spacecraft characterize, in the highest cadence, the constant stream of particles exploding from the sun affect Earth, the planets, and beyond via NASA Goddard Space Flight Center / Flickr",

The big picture is that emerging \"tokenization\" models, especially non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are creating new ways for collectors and investors to buy, sell, and trade digital art. More broadly, these innovations open the door to the tokenization of any products or collectibles that can be captured and owned digitally.\u00a0\n\nMarketplaces powered by NFTs open up new revenue streams for creators, because anytime digital work is resold or their tokens traded on these platforms, no matter how many times, the creator gets a percentage of those secondary sales. It's all transparent and governed by code on the blockchain, and it\u2019s a big shift in creator economies.\n\nOur first guest is one of the biggest names in crypto art, and one of the most mysterious. Murat Pak is the artist and industrial designer who created the AI-powered image sharing site Archillect. Pak has made it a policy to separate their personal identity from their online work, and prefers to keep their quote-unquote real identity hidden, so we conducted this interview by email and converted Pak\u2019s answers to audio using text-to-speech software. As Pak has expressed in other interviews, it's really the work that matters. And we do know a lot about the work, Pak has sold more than 60 pieces of digital art this year on the\u00a0auction site\u00a0SuperRare, for more than $350,000. And that\u2019s just one of the several platforms on which Pak\u2019s work is sold.\u00a0\n\nIn this Q&A, Pak talks with a16z's Zoran Basich about NFTs. These \"non-fungible tokens\" are unique assets that are not interchangeable. Dollar bills are fungible \u2014 each dollar bill is worth exactly the same as every other one. But works of art, for example, or any collectible, can be non-fungible \u2014 their value varies based on the market for that particular asset. With crypto, these assets carry digital ownership rights that can be easily exchanged. We start by discussing the whole concept of digital art, and why anyone would pay for something that (seemingly) can be easily copied.\n\nOur second interview is with Signe Pierce, a visual, digital, and performance artist whose work has appeared in major galleries in Paris, Los Angeles, and New York. She\u2019s currently featuring her artwork on the creator marketplace Foundation. On that site, in addition to auction-style NFT markets, the price of tokens associated with individual works of art is something like you\u2019d see on a stock\u00a0market \u2013 the pricing is real-time, and dynamic and fluctuates according to demand by buyers, who might be investors, collectors, or fans. Signe discusses why she went from working exclusively with galleries to trying crypto marketplaces, how this move affects her work and her business, and how crypto could change the way she engages with her fans. She also offers advice for creators interested in getting into the world of crypto. She starts off by talking about how social media popularity several years ago opened her eyes to the idea of new monetization models for creators.\u00a0\n",

The big picture is that emerging \"tokenization\" models, especially non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are creating new ways for collectors and investors to buy, sell, and trade digital art. More broadly, these innovations open the door to the tokenization of any products or collectibles that can be captured and owned digitally.\u00a0\n\nMarketplaces powered by NFTs open up new revenue streams for creators, because anytime digital work is resold or their tokens traded on these platforms, no matter how many times, the creator gets a percentage of those secondary sales. It's all transparent and governed by code on the blockchain, and it\u2019s a big shift in creator economies.\n\nOur first guest is one of the biggest names in crypto art, and one of the most mysterious. Murat Pak is the artist and industrial designer who created the AI-powered image sharing site Archillect. Pak has made it a policy to separate their personal identity from their online work, and prefers to keep their quote-unquote real identity hidden, so we conducted this interview by email and converted Pak\u2019s answers to audio using text-to-speech software. As Pak has expressed in other interviews, it's really the work that matters. And we do know a lot about the work, Pak has sold more than 60 pieces of digital art this year on the\u00a0auction site\u00a0SuperRare, for more than $350,000. And that\u2019s just one of the several platforms on which Pak\u2019s work is sold.\u00a0\n\nIn this Q&A, Pak talks with a16z's Zoran Basich about NFTs. These \"non-fungible tokens\" are unique assets that are not interchangeable. Dollar bills are fungible \u2014 each dollar bill is worth exactly the same as every other one. But works of art, for example, or any collectible, can be non-fungible \u2014 their value varies based on the market for that particular asset. With crypto, these assets carry digital ownership rights that can be easily exchanged. We start by discussing the whole concept of digital art, and why anyone would pay for something that (seemingly) can be easily copied.\n\nOur second interview is with Signe Pierce, a visual, digital, and performance artist whose work has appeared in major galleries in Paris, Los Angeles, and New York. She\u2019s currently featuring her artwork on the creator marketplace Foundation. On that site, in addition to auction-style NFT markets, the price of tokens associated with individual works of art is something like you\u2019d see on a stock\u00a0market \u2013 the pricing is real-time, and dynamic and fluctuates according to demand by buyers, who might be investors, collectors, or fans. Signe discusses why she went from working exclusively with galleries to trying crypto marketplaces, how this move affects her work and her business, and how crypto could change the way she engages with her fans. She also offers advice for creators interested in getting into the world of crypto. She starts off by talking about how social media popularity several years ago opened her eyes to the idea of new monetization models for creators.\u00a0",

They <i>weave</i> themselves into the <i>fabric </i>of everyday life until they're indistinguishable from it.\" That quote from computer scientist Mark Weiser is from a 1991 paper where he outlined the vision of ubiquitous computing; in it, he also referenced \"seamlessness\"... We just can't get away from textile metaphors: we catch airline \"shuttles\", we \"weave\" through traffic, we follow comment \"threads\u201d -- the metaphors are as ubiquitous and abundant and threaded throughout our lives as the textiles (and computing) all around us.</p><p>In fact, argues author and columnist <a href=\"https://vpostrel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Postrel</a>, the story of textiles IS the story of technology and science (across all kinds of fields, from biology to chemistry); of commerce (as well as management, measurement, machines); but most of all, of <i>civilization</i> (vs. just culture) itself. That's what her <a href=\"https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/virginia-postrel/the-fabric-of-civilization/9781541617605/\" target=\"_blank\">new book</a>, <i>The Fabric of Civilization: How Textiles Made the World</i> is all about.

Zoran Basich of a16z talked to two guests deeply immersed in these topics.\n\nKayvon Tehranian is the founder and CEO of Foundation Labs, a platform for buying and selling limited edition goods.

He also previously cofounded the startup\u00a0Mediachain, which was acquired by Spotify, and is a former music promoter and manager whose focus was on helping artists stay independent.\n\nKayvon and Jesse explain how the emerging crypto models differ from previous attempts to create new revenue streams for artists, and about the role of speculation and hype in creator markets. They also debate whether these new markets will largely be driven by financial motives, or whether cultural factors will be equally powerful in determining\u00a0the growth of creator markets.

What happens when \"unexpected paths\" are actually things like a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic? Editor in chief (and showrunner of the a16z podcasts) Sonal Chokshi probes Raz on these questions and more, while also pulling the threads of how storytelling IS business -- whether it's a company or a community or a product or a movement. So what's the difference between \"building buzz\" and \"engineering word of mouth\"? And how do the stories we tell ourselves, and others, actually move things?\nRaz is also an entrepreneur with his own production company; has won numerous awards and accolades; co-created a podcast for kids (Wow In The World); and is hosting a music interview show for Spotify, not to mention his NPR shows. So what's his best interview tip? And how does his story also thread into this broader sea of stories, along with the story of the podcasting industry, and even the story (and history) of the Bay Area? This episode is for anyone wanting to figure out how to rewrite their own story... it's really for everyone.",

Most of those cases have alleged fraud of more than a $1 million. But what about the countless others that may be cheating taxpayers out of smaller\u2014but not insignificant\u2014sums? How does the government decide who should get money and who shouldn\u2019t among millions of applications from businesses of all industries and sizes\u2014and what role do banks play? How does the program then distribute that money quickly and accurately\u2014or not, in many cases? And what tools are at our disposal to catch those who cheat the system?\u00a0\nHost Lauren Murrow is joined by Bharat Ramamurti, the original member of the COVID-19 Congressional Oversight Commission, which is tasked with evaluating the impact of coronavirus relief loans; Naftali Harris, the CEO of SentiLink, a software company that builds technology to detect synthetic fraud; and a16z fintech general partner Alex Rampell.",

Or rather, \u201cThere is no such thing as \u2018data\u2019, there\u2019s just frozen models\u201d, argues Peter Wang, the co-founder and CEO of Anaconda \u2014 who also created the PyData conferences and grew the early data science community there, while on the frontlines of trying to make Python useful for business analytics. He views both models and data as fluid, more like metaphysics than typical data management\u2026 Or perhaps it\u2019s that when it comes to data, those with a physics background just better appreciate the mind-bending complexity and challenges of reining in the natural world, and therefore get the unique challenges of AI/ML development, observes a16z general partner Martin Casado \u2014 whose first job after college involved computational physics simulation and high-performance computing in Python at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. (Wang, meanwhile, graduated in physics.)\nBut this not just a philosophical question \u2014 the answer has real implications for the margins, organizational structures, and building of AI/ML businesses. Especially as we\u2019re in a tricky time of transition, where customers don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re asking for, yet are looking for AI/ML help or know it\u2019s the future.

For the first time, that's changing.

And more than likely, we are are all familiar with this disease in some way, as it touches 1% of us\u2014millions of lives\u2014and of course, their families. In this episode, we dive into the remarkable story of one such American family, the Galvins: Mimi, Don, and their 12 children, 6 of whom were afflicted with schizophrenia.</p><p>In his new book, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566406/hidden-valley-road-by-robert-kolker/\"><i>Hidden Valley Road: Inside the Mind of an American Family</i></a>, Robert Kolker follows the family from the 1950s to today, through, he writes, \"the eras of institutionalization and shock therapy, the debates between psycho-therapy versus medication, the needle-in-a-haystack search for genetic markers for the disease, and the profound disagreements about the cause and origin of the illness itself.\" Because of that, this is really more than just a portrait of one family; it\u2019s a portrait of how we have struggled over the last decades to understand this mysterious and devastating mental illness: the biology of it, the drivers, the behaviors and pathology, the genomics, and of course the search for treatments that might help, from lobotomies to ECT to thorazine.</p><p>Also joining Robert Kolker and a16z's Hanne Tidnam in this conversation is Stefan McDonough, Executive Director of Genetics at Pfizer World R&D, one of the genetic researchers who worked closely with the Galvins. The conversation follows the key moments where our understanding of this disease began to shift, especially with new technologies and the advent of the Human Genome Project\u2014and finally where we are today, and where our next big break might come from.</p>\n",

How do emojis work, both technically underneath the hood... and in the (committee) Room Where It Happens?\nJoining this episode are former VP of Data at Kickstarter Fred Benenson (and the man behind 'Emoji Dick'); and former New York Times reporter and current Unicode Emoji subcommittee vice-chair, Jennifer 8. Lee (and one of the women behind the dumpling emoji) -- in conversation with Sonal Chokshi.\nimage: Yiying Lu (@yiyinglu)",
