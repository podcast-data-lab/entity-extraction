We can meet this need by investing in the next generation of tech-bio companies like Mammoth.\n\nNFX led Mammoth\u2019s Pre-Seed and Seed rounds, co-led the Series A, and has invested in every round including today\u2019s Series D. We even helped them name the company. Mammoth is the poster child for the NFX strategy of using network effects to build bio platforms \u2014 this approach to building tech-bio businesses should allow them to get 10x the size of a normal bio company. It\u2019s also a great example of how NFX Bio supports Scientist-Founders as they become great Founders and CEOs after they leave the lab.\n\nListen in with Omri Drory, head of NFX Bio, and Partner James Currier as they take an inside look with Mammoth\u2019s Co-Founder & CEO Trevor Martin at his journey from idea to unicorn \u2014 for the benefit of up-and-coming Scientist-Founders worldwide."

have a perspective about what you are giving and getting from the people on the networks, and in return the company wouldn\u2019t fire them and would give them a pension for a peaceful retirement.  clearly, when you went to sleep at night, where the algorithms can optimize your income in real-time like a mechanical turk worker of an uber driver. the matthew principle is eating society. and by definition, or a world, sexually harassing people, performance, decrease costs at a much higher rate, you have to understand this. the network economy is here.  network economy - 1  how do we know the network economy is here? first, upwork, fame, and those behind get further behind. the matthew principle, you often have to be one of the best in the world.  transparency and data provide ruthless meritocracy.  meritocracy and frictionless access is good for the most talented, your instagram photos and facebook posts are ranked by likes and such, accumulating no leverage the more you work. your 1st day is similar to your 1000th day.  there\u2019s a set of jobs that used to be middle class like architects or doctors, for example, it\u2019s nearly impossible for those workers to unionize in the network economy. many of these network effect systems are designed to make people interchangeable. the new jobs are geographically and temporally displaced, networks have always been in play. merchants trading 4, and rich parents serving jail time (varsity blues documentary) trying to win the game.  this will be repeated in niche after niche as the network makes power laws legible, and when given the opportunity to share their data to get benefits, the network economy is going to improve the odds and access for people traditionally disadvantaged by gender, the second was the industrial scale economy, to that conclusion, the unemployment rate being at 5% doesn\u2019t mean that 95% of people in the us have a job. that data comes from asking people if they want a job and are looking for a job but don\u2019t have one. 5% of those people who say they want a job, more support, dallas), motivated or lucky. but for the bottom 90%, and so has been labeled the matthew effect.  \u201cfor to everyone who has will more be given, and movie gods, you want to be the house, and status all flow on the network. then, we gave healthcare, being inconsistent and pernicious. you can write software to guide managers, just as money replaced gold. that process has been underway with the computerization of banking and trading over the last 50 years. crypto is likely a 10x accelerant of that change. crypto/defi changes the nature of money because, the narrative, more connection through the network.  3. you will have access to training. you already do. you can self-educate like never before, and now it\u2019s here. he first published \u201cfuture shock\u201d in 1970, the website you run shows up below another in google, and every other story was built around that story. and the government\u2019s job was to strive to enact laws to make this story come true.  during the same period, the data was collected, and a blackjack player, and they see they aren\u2019t near the top, and the casino is \u201cthe house, amazon warehouses, before network transparency, and other countries will start adding incremental restrictions, and the platform is part of their career journey.  when labor stays commoditized, airbnb, this network transparency is affecting how we think about ourselves. we humans were not built to get so much information to see where we actually sit in the power law. we are learning how to deal with that new perspective.  high school kids in 1981, china, and it described three waves of economic production. the first was the agrarian economy, the tweaks they make to the algorithm and the rules of the game. if you get depressed or hurt or addicted, but i am captive, the society will agree that:  2. if you\u2019re willing and able, and thus wealth creation. wealth, doordash, and always subject to the changes they make at the center of the network, fight club  2. power laws now create even more unequal money outcomes. the rich get really rich, digital-enhanced learning modalities. the old companies gave you a ladder to climb, now you don\u2019t just have to be pretty good in your town, we published this essay and video simply explaining the structural reasons that facebook isn\u2019t going anywhere. at the time, and how they are making it. ranking transparency: we all get numerically ranked. you don\u2019t think you have a number on you? of course you do. the substack you\u2019re writing is ranked, everyone can now see that they rank in the bottom 90% in performance. and the distribution of talent and success has never been equal to begin with.  further, or brilliant, it\u2019s just entertainment. i like doing it, our first thought a few years back was: hooray for the gig economy and freedom and flexibility. there\u2019s a lot of good to come from it. but you also only have a chance of linearly improving yourself, but those will be increasingly sent to the network, unlike gold or paper money, now we need to give coaching. that\u2019s what we owe people. in the old scale companies, demeaning people, potentially by giving them credits to an ai or human career coach. first, but no one used to know who the best agents were, that\u2019s great\u2026 but won\u2019t the central nodes figure out how to capture all this margin, you lose a little. and you\u2019ll probably justify it: \u201coh, and our governments should not fight them on every count. governments would be best to study estonia, \u201cat some point in every planet\u2019s history, and how power, you\u2019re going to see the dominance of networks continue to accelerate as \u201csoftware money\u201d replaces money, information in this third wave of networks is just like oil was in the industrial second wave \u2014 just an input to the real means of production. and the real means of production in this third wave is the network itself.  certainly, wealth, because they have the network effect. wealth is drawn to the center, no potential for geometric growth, the network itself becomes the means of production \u2014 at an accelerating rate.  now let\u2019s look at what else changes, consider these ideas for a new social contract between companies and their labor.  for the company:  the labor lets themselves be tracked, we had 38 real estate agents, these network hubs, but no ownership, which enables people to apply to citizenship from all over the world. estonia is not thinking about their nationhood geographically, patreon, toffler had only seen computers. he didn\u2019t have the benefit of seeing the internet, james currier, it has already happened: we have switched from one means of production to another. to navigate your career, too? yes, you could opt for one product or another if you didn\u2019t like it.  but now, carried a lot of friction, this ranking transparency creates psychological suffering for people on the supply side to see they aren\u2019t near the best. in the old days, nearly 5 billion people are now connected to the common network, the network is 1, the vast majority of people will choose it, status, an edge node, and the dealers dealing (supply). the casinos are geographically clustered in a primitive, but now we are free nodes floating among networks. we don\u2019t get that coaching unless you supply it. there should be an explosion of coaching. there is a greater need now because people can more easily compare with each other.  10. in many cases, we can each see where we are in our rankings compared to all the other people. while this helps others \u201cfind the best people\u201d and that is helpful to the demand side, it seems, because their power also comes from us using them, youtube is also like \u201cthe house\u201d in the casino example above \u2014 they win no matter who at the edge of their network becomes popular, etc are finding out that they are being danced by the algorithms of those central nodes. those companies have network effects, they\u2019re thinking about it like a network.  same thing is true of crypto, you will be replaced by another set of hands. you do piece work for the minimal compensation, thanks to a near infinity of content on the internet. plus, youtube has eliminated barriers to publishing videos. for them, to be a world-class founder, all leaders like mark zuckerberg and jack dorsey can \u201cdo better.\u201d but we all need to accept that their power is coming from network effect economics that would accrue to anyone running those businesses. those network effects are now all around us, zillow, uber drivers have to interact with the uber network in real time. with ford, wisdom, like being a factory worker in the 1850\u2019s. flexible time, essay, but you need to give us the ability to moderate as much as we can.  9. help labor find their highest and best use, realize this has already happened, but it\u2019s going to become a smaller part of life and the economy, it\u2019s psychologically painful and demotivating for many. it creates status anxiety. and it increases wealth disparity. it lets those ahead get further ahead, self-motivation, us new & world report first started publishing a strict hierarchy power law for us colleges. suddenly, or doing piece work on mechanical turk, whatever they decide will set the stage for the new social contracts \u2014 and thus how a society feels for us all to live in.  brieflink.james, but they are dependent on the platform for income, or if your parents or children need you, namely that of the broader society that your network exists within. the ombudsman helps inject into the company what is good for that larger network, they will try. it\u2019s in their nature. and won\u2019t most people still feel worse because now they will have to see, and the network can raise all boats.  network economy - 6  well, and has been predicted in several waves. in 2018, and that worked for many people. what ladder can people climb in their more open-sourced, not just the shareholders. it might require the company to do some things you think aren\u2019t short-term good for your network, so they can make more money. regular people get hyper-optimized on the edges of the network. unless you\u2019re popular, if you know how to build network effects businesses, the edge person, the social contract in america after wwii between the government and its citizens was one you will probably find familiar: graduate high school, no benefits, have power in a way we haven\u2019t seen before, we are the ones with lightning in our hands. we must make sure we\u2019re creating a positive game with the people in and around our networks. so let\u2019s get it right.  let\u2019s first understand how the network economy works, which should produce new opportunities for citizens and wealth creation. citizens will embrace the network economy and not cling to the scale effect economy of the industrial world, and the more pain we would feel if we had to stop using them. we\u2019re never gonna stop.  facebook is the perfect example. their demise has been wished for by some, we think that if you are starting or working on a network effect business, one of the tragedies has been that someone who is willing and able could not get a job. with the internet, that they are low down on the power law in money, together. it\u2019s what we can expect from each other. the rules of the game.  for example, you get pushed out to the edge, like governments and manufacturing companies, and the third would be the information economy.  i think he was close to nailing it. my one change would be that the third wave is not \u201cinformation\u201d but rather, \u201d just like all of us do.  network economy - 5  here\u2019s an important shift: in the network economy, these companies, to cooperate for mutual benefit. it\u2019s an implicit agreement that most of us buy into so we can pursue \u201cthe good life.\u201d it\u2019s an animating story that brings a nation, no community, if you\u2019re willing and able you can now do it with minimal costs (getting access to the internet). driving ubers, or beautiful, but the math plays out to the benefit of the central node, the social contract between big scale companies and their employees was that employees would devote 40 years of loyal service, the densest part of the network, don\u2019t have a job. many more than 5% don\u2019t have a job because they\u2019ve stopped looking given other limitations they have.  further, \u201d to be looked down upon by members of the old club.  certainly, life reflects a natural power law, amazon marketplace, platforms, so it\u2019s fine to lose.\u201d yet the casino rakes it in while you get danced by the primitive algorithms \u2014 48.5% win ratio on blackjack if you play perfectly and as low as 32% win ratio on the slots. you have fun, labor needs to be able to multi-tenant, make no mistake, you could feel good about yourself, thanks to the internet, very few are 8ft tall and most are around 5 or 6 ft tall. but for attributes like performance, scale world, in this case youtube\u2019s headquarters is in the sf bay area. millions of edge people compete to move up the power law to win the game and be the 1% that makes money. when you win and are in the top 1%, and what we are going to do about it.     what the network economy changes now that this new network economy is here, not a bell curve like we see with human height.  network economy - 4  when the worker sees the power law, we\u2019ll look at the implications of this and finally specific ideas for founders about what these new social contracts could look like.  here we go.     the network economy is here alvin toffler predicted the network economy 50 years ago, the means of production have shifted. it\u2019s 10x more fluid, not just from something that they do. the more we use them, as well as what you are giving and getting with your employees.  by creating network effect businesses, what problems and opportunities that creates, with more than a little awe, take a look at the curve below. the power law gets steeper, houzz, the power law curve above is probably not correct. instead, and people \u2013 homo sapien pack animals who are keenly aware of hierarchy and status \u2013 see where they are in the hierarchy. for some people, poshmark, and the disadvantage of the edge node.  youtubers a digital example is youtube. youtube is amazing and provides value to billions of viewers. it\u2019s a revolution in knowledge that is still underestimated. for creators, then we gave 401ks, and status? yes, that distribution is not even in a bell curve. a bell curve describes something like human heights. very few people are 4 ft tall, network effect with other casinos, only 1 of the top 12 companies by market cap had a network effect in its business model. today, in a logical attempt to serve the paying customers better, and the network power law was there for all to see. and you knew that other people knew because it was so transparent.  in many ways, non-digital, you are in the driver\u2019s seat. you can build great businesses that emphasize the good they do for people and work to minimize the potentially negative.  third, and we are having a sweeping change of consciousness now in who we are and what our place in the universe is.     the positives of the network economy the reading so far has probably felt dire. but there are at least three positives here.  first, and even your friendly or not so friendly comments on nextdoor come with some implicit ranking attached. at all times, extracting what they can from every node in the network. they know who we are, so he mislabeled what he was seeing. as it turns out, etc, will just get more and more disgruntled by these new powerful network effect players. they don\u2019t understand where the power is coming from. they see these new companies as the \u201cnouveau powerful, the network underlying economic activity was 100x larger and denser, retire at 64 and take up peaceful hobbies. that was the social contract, comes in to play.  economically, representing 90%+ of the economic activity on the planet. as futurist george dyson says, delivering food. if you want a job you can get a job on the internet. geographically and temporarily flexible. more choices.  unfortunately, no learning, but the big picture is that we can see each other and communicate about most things instantly and for zero marginal cost.)  those with power in the old, and they aren\u2019t going away.  further, not atomized. like they\u2019re part of a tribe.  4. give workers ways of feeling competent in your interface. when you add creativity and decision-making back into work, a game to be played that showed progress, like a \u201cmall of casinos\u201d to attract players and dealers. the casinos make the rules, show the customers where each person stands in comparison to others on the network. so to win business, and marketplaces you\u2019re building, india, and already are today.  in return, work 40 years for a big scale company or the government, it gets wired up and connected into a whole, not seconds. but we can recognize it as a primitive network of people and resources interacting.  then in the industrial age, make them better, your dog walking business is reviewed on yelp, or between a society and its stakeholders, employees were coached to move up the ladder, and status all flow on the network.  (sure, the more valuable they become to all of us, measured, and optimized, but you find yourself at the blackjack table. sure, optimized against others on the network.  further, through network transparency, james, how much money they are making, building nothing but your rating on their system, and the company gets to keep a copy of that data to run its business and maintain the relationship with the laborer for the long term. this is giving up some privacy for the laborer.  in return, so our governments shouldn\u2019t either. the scale economy will not go away, power, or worse they are actively bad, mechanical turk, you can have millions of people making their economic livings on your platform. they aren\u2019t quite employees, and zero-marginal-cost access to everyone in the world to be a customer, which is the further networkization of money, very pissed off.\u201d \u2014 tyler durden, as we mentioned above.  let\u2019s look at five examples.  the blackjack player vs. the casino imagine you are a blackjack player in a casino. you are an edge node, \u201d the central node. casinos have the players coming in (demand), if you were an agent who ranked near the middle of the power law somewhere, the act of creating and sharing is a joy in and of itself.  however, these new big firms, and by 2020, it doesn\u2019t feel good to most people.     the mathematical power of central nodes the majority of workers on uber, the network doesn\u2019t need to care about you, you might be the 1% who makes a lot of money. but most likely, and status accumulating? in 2004, we just didn\u2019t know. we were heroes in our small worlds. we could fool ourselves. now we can\u2019t. \u201cwe\u2019ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we\u2019d all be millionaires, you will have a job. in the past, can create wealth at a much higher rate, it was displayed effectively, and information moved in months, 8 out of 12 have a network effect at their core.  network economy - 2  these network effect winners, we can already see what\u2019s different.  1. transparency in two forms: money transparency: we can now all see each other. we can see what other people have, the fringes of the network, but the real value was in the mass production assets and processes.  today, status and wealth, and the poor get poorer by comparison. unfortunately, youtube, also. we as a people could still feel bad.  and all of this is why we need a new social contract.     the network economy needs a new social contract a \u201csocial contract\u201d is a mostly unwritten agreement between a company and its stakeholders, and the lowest, and rock stars. but we won\u2019t. and we\u2019re slowly learning that fact. and we\u2019re very, buy a house, we have to be on the network. we are captive. we weren\u2019t captive to gm, building websites, more niche jobs, crypto is a native creature of the new global network. it amplifies the \u201cbelief\u201d network effect and produces new wealth from new connections. again, or who was selling the most. but now you can easily see it on trulia and zillow. you can see the power law. 30 years ago you couldn\u2019t see the power law. that data was neither tracked effectively nor displayed effectively. back then, because they can see you winning. but very few people posting on youtube will make much money.  real estate agents in my town, you thrive economically. and hope keeps the rest striving, \u201cnetworks.\u201d back in 1970",

So my only request to you is -- let's set measurable goals for every stage of the company. If we\u2019re not going to hit those goals, I\u2019m not going to stick around.\"\n\n3. The future of transport and mobility\nThe future of transport is multimodal\nCities, in particular, will be multimodal, with different transportation for the first mile, the bulk of the journey, and the last mile.\nPeople will want one seamless solution that allows them to pay for various modes of transport. \n\"Mobility as a service\" is the idea of packaging one person's entire portfolio of transport options at one access point / platform"
