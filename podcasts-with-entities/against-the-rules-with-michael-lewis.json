    "description": "Journalist and bestselling author Michael Lewis takes a searing look at what\u2019s happened to fairness in American life through the lens of people who depend on public trust. After exploring what's happened to referees and coaches, the third season of Against the Rules tackles what's happened to our trust in experts and expertise. An expert has probably saved your life more than once. So why is it so hard to judge who the real experts are? And why, once we\u2019ve found them, do we struggle to listen to what experts have to say? In this season, we meet oceanographers and baseball writers, nurses and former gang members \u2014\u00a0people who don't have a lot in common but the mixed blessing of their expertise.\n\niHeartMedia is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries.",

After exploring what's happened to referees and coaches, the third season of Against the Rules tackles what's happened to our trust in experts and expertise. An expert has probably saved your life more than once. So why is it so hard to judge who the real experts are? And why, once we\u2019ve found them, do we struggle to listen to what experts have to say? In this season, we meet oceanographers and baseball writers, nurses and former gang members \u2014\u00a0people who don't have a lot in common but the mixed blessing of their expertise.\n\niHeartMedia is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries."
