The aid was supposed to make up for decades of discrimination. However, White farmers have sued, and that aid has yet to be paid out as the issue makes it way through the courts.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Eddie Wise is one farmer who claimed to face discrimination. He was the son of a sharecropper. In 1996, he and his wife, Dorothy, bought a farm with a loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Twenty years later, the USDA foreclosed on the property and evicted him.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>John Biewen of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sceneonradio.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Scene on Radio</a>\u201d teamed up with Reveal to investigate Wise\u2019s claim of race-based discrimination. Wise\u2019s story is one piece of the puzzle explaining how Black families went from owning nearly a million farms in 1920 to now fewer than 36,000.<br>\n <br>\nThe federal government has admitted it was part of the problem. In 1997, a USDA report said discrimination by the agency was a factor in the decline of Black farms. A landmark class-action lawsuit on behalf of Black farmers, Pigford v. Glickman, was settled in 1999.

And now, GOP candidates are tapping into the \u201cBig Lie,\u201d campaigning for office on the promise to change how future elections are run. \n\nWe zero in on Michigan, a key swing state where Republicans are aiming to shape the future of elections. Reporter Byard Duncan talks with the Antrim County clerk, who was flooded with ugly calls and threats after her office accidentally assigned votes meant for Donald Trump to Joe Biden. While the error was quickly fixed, many in the GOP, including Trump, have used the county to sow doubt about the entire election\u2019s results. Duncan reports on the race for secretary of state, Michigan\u2019s top election official, and how the leading GOP candidate has repeatedly referenced Antrim County to question the integrity of elections. The Trump-endorsed candidate has outraised her Republican opponents by at least tenfold.\u00a0\n\nThere was no meaningful election fraud in Michigan in 2020.

The company is the Dominican Republic\u2019s largest private employer and has strong links to two powerful Florida businessmen, Alfonso and Pepe Fanjul. The reporters speak to workers who have no access to government pensions, so they\u2019re forced to work in the fields into their 80s for as little as $3 a day. Through its sugar exports to the U.S. and other businesses, Central Romana generates an estimated $1.5 billion a year \u2013 but some workers are so poor they can\u2019t afford doctors\u2019 visits.\u00a0\nIn the 1990s, Tolan reported on human trafficking and child labor in the Dominican sugar industry.

Records of disciplinary decisions showed that an internal panel of high-ranking officers kept some troubled officers on the force \u2013 even after department investigators substantiated allegations of criminal misconduct and recommended they be fired.\n\nAurora, Colorado: \u2018Excited Delirium\u2019 and Ketamine in Police Confrontations\u00a0\n\nWhen Elijah McClain was stopped by police in Aurora, Colorado, in 2019, he was injected with a powerful sedative, ketamine, and died after suffering cardiac arrest. His death sparked widespread protests.\n\nKUNC reporters Michael de Yoanna and Rae Solomon covered McClain\u2019s case, and it made them wonder how often paramedics and law enforcement use ketamine and why. What they found led to real change.\n\nSt. Louis: The History of Prisoner Disenfranchisement Laws in Missouri\n\nPrisoner disenfranchisement laws have been on the books since the founding of our nation and disproportionately affect voters of color.\u00a0\n\nReveal Investigative Fellow and St. Louis Public Radio journalist Andrea Henderson reports from Missouri, where about 63,000 formerly incarcerated people could not vote in the last presidential election. She speaks to a community activist who credits getting his right to vote restored as the start of putting him on his current path.\n\n\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a>\u00a0\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"http://revealnews.org?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/newsletter</a>\nConnect with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>\n\r\n      "

We also hear from locals who are trying to build trust and connection with their houseless neighbors and others who are tired of seeing tents and call the police for help. We also hear what it takes to move someone off the street, one person at a time.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n      "

Slaves who were happy to work for them. That twisted history is also shared with schoolchildren on class trips.

In this episode, we hear the experiences of both Ellsberg and Rosenthal.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>When Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971, he was turning his back on a long career close to power, immersed in government secrets. His work as a nuclear war strategist made him fear that a small conflict could erupt into a nuclear holocaust.</p>\n\n<p>When the Vietnam War flared, Ellsberg worried his worst fears would be realized. He wonders if leaking the top-secret report he\u2019s read could help stop the war. Soon, he was secretly copying the 7,000-page history that would come to be known as the Pentagon Papers and showing them to anyone he thought could help.</p>\n\n<p>President Richard Nixon wakes up to the biggest leak in American history. But his first reaction is a little surprising: The Pentagon Papers might make trouble for the Democrats \u2013 this instinct starts a chain reaction that helps bring down his presidency.</p>\n\n<p><em>This episode was originally aired in <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/episodes/the-pentagon-papers-secrets-lies-and-leaks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">May 2016</a>.</em></p>\r\n      ",

Reporter Laura C. Morel talks with business owners around Los Angeles who either received PPP money or faced insurmountable hurdles to get one of the forgivable loans. Morel talks with a Latinx barber in the Florence neighborhood, where just 10% of businesses got PPP loans. In a predominantly Black area of Inglewood, we meet clothing store owner Annie Graham, who couldn\u2019t get a PPP loan last year, even from a lender who hooked up with Magic Johnson to specifically help minority- and women-owned businesses access the government lending program.

But Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) money disproportionately went to White neighborhoods, leaving communities of color behind.\nSmall businesses are the heart of Los Angeles\u2019 many neighborhoods. Reporter Laura C. Morel talks with business owners around Los Angeles who either received PPP money or faced insurmountable hurdles to get one of the forgivable loans. Morel talks with a Latinx barber in the Florence neighborhood, where just 10% of businesses got PPP loans. In a predominantly Black area of Inglewood, we meet clothing store owner Annie Graham, who couldn\u2019t get a PPP loan last year, even from a lender who hooked up with Magic Johnson to specifically help minority- and women-owned businesses access the government lending program.
