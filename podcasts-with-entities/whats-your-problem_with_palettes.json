How do you convince people to buy a house on the Internet? How do you sell thousands of dog ramps to weiner dogs all across America when a pandemic breaks the global supply chain?\u00a0\r\n\r\nHosted by former Planet Money host Jacob Goldstein, What\u2019s Your Problem helps listeners understand the problems really smart people are trying to solve right now.\r\n\r\niHeartMedia is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries.",
