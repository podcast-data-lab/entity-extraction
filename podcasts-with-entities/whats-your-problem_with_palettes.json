    "description": "Every week on What\u2019s Your Problem, entrepreneurs and engineers talk about\u00a0the future they\u2019re trying to build \u2013 and the problems they have to solve to get there.\r\n\r\nHow do you take a drone delivery service you\u2019ve built in Rwanda and make it work in North Carolina? How do you convince people to buy a house on the Internet? How do you sell thousands of dog ramps to weiner dogs all across America when a pandemic breaks the global supply chain?\u00a0\r\n\r\nHosted by former Planet Money host Jacob Goldstein, What\u2019s Your Problem helps listeners understand the problems really smart people are trying to solve right now.\r\n\r\niHeartMedia is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries.",
