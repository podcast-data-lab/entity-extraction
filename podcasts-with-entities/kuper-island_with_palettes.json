As a kid, he looked up to him. Idolized him. But also feared him. And even hated him. He told Rudy that to succeed, he would have to leave everything behind: his family, friends, and culture. In this six-part series, Rudy's journey brings him back in time, to learn how colonization impacted Indigenous people, from those who lived it.
