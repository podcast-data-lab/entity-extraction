He's got up-to-date team news, captaincy picks, transfer advice, plus answers to these questions:\n\nIs Cornet, who is guaranteed a start, a better midfield option than the Leicester players, Maddison, Barnes, etc. who will be subject to rotation?\n\nShould I sell Barnes for Maddison who\u2019s in much better form, or are both rotation risks in equal measure due to conference league involvement?\n\nBest Leicester defender?\u00a0\n\nShould we sell one of our premium assets (Salah/Son/Kane) for Bruno/Ronaldo?\n\nYour opinion on Sancho if Bruno is unaffordable?\n\nIs the Bruno two week punt for Salah worth it?\u00a0\n\nWhich is the best defence to double up on? Liverpool, Chelsea, or City?\n\nDo we keep Coutinho now with the possible DGW for AVL in GW35?\n\nOut of these 3 forwards: Broja, Adams & Weghorst, which one would you replace first?\u00a0\n\nFree Hit question - should you go all DGWers or mix it with SGWers who have good fixtures?\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Is a Son and Jimenez to Kulusevski and Kane for a -4 worthwhile?\n\nWould you sell Coutinho for Kulusevski?\n\nWhich one Spurs player to pick for the next 2 GWs, Doherty or Kulusevski?\n\nIs it worth selling someone like Digne or Saiss ahead of GW29 for a Spurs defender (probably Doherty) for the extra fixture in 29 even though both Villa & Wolves do both play in 30?\n\nWith Spurs & Arsenal doubling in 29, playing in 30 & good fixtures going forward\u2026are \u2018big hits\u2019 (-8,-12) justifiable if single game week players with poor fixtures (eg. Villa or teams blanking in 30) are being replaced?\n\nIf you owned Reece James, would you hold as he\u2019s due back in GW31? Or sell him on? If so, who for?\n\nJota or Diaz to fill the Bowen spot in midfield?\n\nHow many and which Leicester assets do we need for the upcoming gameweeks?\n\nBest Leicester defensive asset to bring in?\n\nIs GW30 worthy of a Free Hit if you can only field 6-7 players or would it be better utilised later in the season for a big DGW?\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
