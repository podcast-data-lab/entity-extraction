    "description": "Big tech is transforming every aspect of our world. But how? And at what cost? This season of Land of the Giants \u2013 The Twitter Fantasy \u2013 will tell the story of Twitter (X) at a crucial moment for the platform, exactly one year after Elon Musk took over. Hosted by Vox senior correspondent Peter Kafka, the four-episode season will survey the company's outsize influence on politics and culture. How did Twitter become the Internet\u2019s town square, for better and for worse? And where is it heading, now that Elon\u2019s in charge?\u00a0 \n\nFrom Vox and the Vox Media Podcast Network. New episodes drop every Wednesday.",
