To get 15% off your plan, use code CHRIS at allthehacks.com/riverside\n\u00a0\nAthletic Greens\nAthletic Greens is a foundational nutrition drink designed to remove the friction from covering the daily nutritional needs of a modern diet. It combines more than 9 essential nutrition products into one convenient and great-tasting drink, giving you an easy and efficient way to get you daily multivitamin, multimineral, probiotic, prebiotic, functional greens blend, immune support complex and more. It contains no GMOs, no harmful ingredients and no artificial colors or sweeteners.\nRight now, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free 1 year supply of immune-supporting Vitamin D and 5\u00a0 free travel packs with your first purchase. So to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional\u00a0 insurance visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens\n\u00a0\nMasterworks\nThis episode is brought to you by Masterworks. Masterworks is an alternative investing platform that gives you access to one of the most exclusive and overlooked investments in history: blue-chip art. Masterworks lets regular people invest in paintings by legends like Banksy, Basquiat and Warhol without spending millions. I've now used masterworks to invest in 10 different paintings, including a $15 million dollar Picasso.\nHere\u2019s how it works: Masterworks will buy a painting they think will appreciate well over time, then they securitize that painting with the SEC, so you can invest in it instead of buying the whole thing. Once they sell the painting, later on, you get your share of the proceeds. It\u2019s that simple. They\u2019ve offered over 100 paintings so far and the three that have sold realized a net annualized gain over 30% per work. They have over 280,000 users and demand is as high as ever. All the Hacks has partnered with them to give you all priority access by going to allthehacks.com/masterworks\n(see important disclosures at masterworks.io/cd)\n\u00a0\nBlockFi\nThis episode is brought to you by BlockFi. If you're interested in Crypto, BlockFi is one of the best ways to get started, letting you easily buy, sell and store your crypto assets. After signing up and linking your bank account, you can instantly trade a variety of cryptocurrencies and store them all in a secure wallet that lets you control and transfer your holdings however you want. You can also set up recurring transfers so you can dollar cost average your crypto investments over time.\nOr if you want another way to put your crypto investing on autopilot, there's the BlockFi Crypto Rewards Credit Card. While 1.5% cash back isn't the best in the market, that cash back is automatically invested into Bitcoin, Ethereum or whatever cryptocurrency you want. If you want to check out BlockFi, you can get an exclusive bonus of up to $250 free when you sign at allthehacks.com/blockfi\n\u00a0\nConnect with All the Hacks\nAll the Hacks: Newsletter | Website | Facebook | Email\nChris Hutchins: Twitter | Instagram | Website | LinkedIn",

No matter the reason, it's invaluable to know that there's someone professionally trained, who can help you through whatever you're facing.\u00a0\nAnd that's exactly what BetterHelp can do. They can assess your needs and match you with a licensed professional therapist in less than 48 hours. And because it's all online, it's way more affordable than traditional in-person therapy (not to mention it is so much easier to have a video, phone or chat session from the comfort of your own home).

Daffy makes it so much easier to put money aside for charity. You can make your tax deductible contributions all at once. Or you can set aside a little each week or month. Then anytime in the future, you can give to more than one and a half million charities, schools, and faith-based organizations in a matter of seconds.\u00a0\nSo you can separate the decision to give (and get your tax deduction) from deciding exactly which organization you want to support and when. My favorite part is that you can invest your contributions to your Daffy account so they can grow tax-free to let you have even more impact in the future.

No matter the reason, it's invaluable to know that there's someone professionally trained, who can help you through whatever you're facing.\u00a0\nAnd that's exactly what BetterHelp can do. They can assess your needs and match you with a licensed professional therapist in less than 48 hours. And because it's all online, it's way more affordable than traditional in-person therapy (not to mention it is so much easier to have a video, phone or chat session from the comfort of your own home).

Daffy makes it so much easier to put money aside for charity. You can make your tax deductible contributions all at once. Or you can set aside a little each week or month. Then anytime in the future, you can give to more than one and a half million charities, schools, and faith-based organizations in a matter of seconds.\u00a0\nSo you can separate the decision to give (and get your tax deduction) from deciding exactly which organization you want to support and when. My favorite part is that you can invest your contributions to your Daffy account so they can grow tax-free to let you have even more impact in the future.

Masterworks is an alternative investing platform that gives you access to one of the most exclusive and overlooked investments in history: blue-chip art. Masterworks lets regular people invest in paintings by legends like Banksy, Basquiat and Warhol without spending millions. I've now used masterworks to invest 10 different paintings, including a 15 million dollar Picasso.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Masterworks will buy a painting they think will appreciate well over time, then they securitize that painting with the SEC, so you can invest in it instead of buying the whole thing. Once they sell the painting, later on, you get your share of the proceeds. It\u2019s that simple. They\u2019ve offered over 100 paintings so far and the three that have sold realized a net annualized gain over 30% per work. They have over 280,000 users and demand is as high as ever.

Masterworks is an alternative investing platform that gives you access to one of the most exclusive and overlooked investments in history: blue-chip art. Masterworks lets regular people invest in paintings by legends like Banksy Basquiat and Warhol without spending millions. In fact, I used masterworks to invest in a 15 million dollar Picasso the other day.<br />Here\u2019s how it works: Masterworks will buy a painting they think will appreciate well over time, then they securitize that painting with the SEC, so you can invest in it instead of buying the whole thing. Once they sell the painting, later on, you get your share of the proceeds. It\u2019s that simple. In 2020 and 2021, masterworks sold two paintings that appreciated by over 30%. They have over 280,000 users and demand is as high as ever.

Masterworks is an alternative investing platform that gives you access to one of the most exclusive and overlooked investments in history: blue-chip art. Masterworks lets regular people invest in paintings by legends like Banksy Basquiat and Warhol without spending millions. In fact, I used masterworks to invest in a 15 million dollar Picasso the other day.\nHere\u2019s how it works: Masterworks will buy a painting they think will appreciate well over time, then they securitize that painting with the SEC, so you can invest in it instead of buying the whole thing. Once they sell the painting, later on, you get your share of the proceeds. It\u2019s that simple. In 2020 and 2021, masterworks sold two paintings that appreciated by over 30%. They have over 280,000 users and demand is as high as ever. But I partnered with them to give you all priority access by going to https://allthehacks.com/masterworks (see important disclosures at masterworks.io/disclaimer).\n\u00a0\nStarship\nThis episode is brought to you by Starship. Are you looking for a new HSA? You can get one free with Starship and signing up only takes a few minutes. If you're not familiar with HSAs, they\u2019re health savings accounts for health-related expenses like doctor appointments, glasses, prescriptions, and over-the-counter meds. The best part is that an HSA from Starship lets you get tax breaks on account contributions, when purchasing eligible expenses and on any investment growth.\nIn the past, my HSAs have had high monthly fees and I\u2019ve been forced to invest through an old school brokerage.

Are you looking for a new HSA? You can get one free with Starship and signing up only takes a few minutes. If you're not familiar with HSAs, they\u2019re health savings accounts for health-related expenses like doctor appointments, glasses, prescriptions, and over-the-counter meds. The best part is that an HSA from Starship lets you get tax breaks on account contributions, when purchasing eligible expenses and on any investment growth.</p><p>In the past, my HSAs have had high monthly fees and I\u2019ve been forced to invest through an old school brokerage. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about Starship \u2013 there are no hidden fees, no minimum balance fees, and no monthly maintenance fees. And you can spend, save, and invest your HSA funds all from their simple app. Also, instead of having to manually invest your funds, Starship can automatically invest your contributions using their robo-advisory tool.

Masterworks is an alternative investing platform that gives you access to one of the most exclusive and overlooked investments in history: blue-chip art. Masterworks lets regular people invest in paintings by legends like Banksy Basquiat and Warhol without spending millions. In fact, I used masterworks to invest in a 15 million dollar Picasso the other day.\u00a0</p><p>Here\u2019s how it works: Masterworks will buy a painting they think will appreciate well over time, then they securitize that painting with the SEC, so you can invest in it instead of buying the whole thing. Once they sell the painting, later on, you get your share of the proceeds. It\u2019s that simple. In 2020 and 2021, masterworks sold two paintings that appreciated by over 30%. They have over 280,000 users and demand is as high as ever. But I partnered with them to give you all priority access by going to <a href=\"https://allthehacks.com/masterworks\" target=\"_blank\">https://allthehacks.com/masterworks</a> (see important disclosures at masterworks.io/disclaimer).</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>Starship</i></p><p>This episode is brought to you by Starship. Are you looking for a new HSA? You can get one free with Starship and signing up only takes a few minutes. If you're not familiar with HSAs, they\u2019re health savings accounts for health-related expenses like doctor appointments, glasses, prescriptions, and over-the-counter meds. The best part is that an HSA from Starship lets you get tax breaks on account contributions, when purchasing eligible expenses and on any investment growth.</p><p>In the past, my HSAs have had high monthly fees and I\u2019ve been forced to invest through an old school brokerage. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about Starship \u2013 there are no hidden fees, no minimum balance fees, and no monthly maintenance fees. And you can spend, save, and invest your HSA funds all from their simple app. Also, instead of having to manually invest your funds, Starship can automatically invest your contributions using their robo-advisory tool. I think Starship is the easiest HSA out there and you can sign up in minutes at <a href=\"https://allthehacks.com/starship\" target=\"_blank\">https://allthehacks.com/starship</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>BlockFi</i></p><p>This episode is brought to you by BlockFi. BlockFi is the company I use to store all my crypto and I think they provide huge value because. Whether you buy your crypto with them or transfer in what you already have, you can start earning interest on all of it, which is a great way to earn some passive income with almost no effort. And that also includes stable coins based in us dollars where you can earn 9% without having your savings fluctuate with the crypto markets. This is where I store the cash I used to keep at a high yield savings account. Since opening my account, I've already earned thousands of dollars of interest.</p><p>BlockFi also has a rewards credit card that instead of earning points or miles gives you Bitcoin back on every purchase you make offering 3.5% back in the first three months and 1.5% percent back after that. If you want to check out BlockFi, you can get an exclusive bonus of up to $250 free when you sign at <a href=\"https://allthehacks.com/blockfi\" target=\"_blank\">https://allthehacks.com/blockfi</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Connect with All the Hacks</strong></p><p>All the Hacks: <a href=\"https://allthehacks.substack.com/welcome\" target=\"_blank\">Newsletter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.allthehacks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/allthehacks\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"mailto:info@allthehacks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Email</a></p><p>Chris Hutchins: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/hutchins\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chrishutchins\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://chrishutchins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrishutchins/\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n",

BlockFi is the company I use to store all my crypto and I think they provide huge value because. Whether you buy your crypto with them or transfer in what you already have, you can start earning interest on all of it, which is a great way to earn some passive income with almost no effort. And that also includes stable coins based in us dollars where you can earn 9% without having your savings fluctuate with the crypto markets. This is where I store the cash I used to keep at a high yield savings account. Since opening my account, I've already earned thousands of dollars of interest.</p><p>BlockFi also has a rewards credit card that instead of earning points or miles gives you Bitcoin back on every purchase you make offering 3.5% back in the first three months and 1.5% percent back after that. If you want to check out BlockFi, you can get an exclusive bonus of up to $250 free when you sign at <a href=\"https://allthehacks.com/blockfi\" target=\"_blank\">https://allthehacks.com/blockfi</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Connect with All the Hacks</strong></p><p>All the Hacks: <a href=\"https://allthehacks.substack.com/welcome\" target=\"_blank\">Newsletter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.allthehacks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/allthehacks\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"mailto:info@allthehacks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Email</a></p><p>Chris Hutchins: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/hutchins\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chrishutchins\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://chrishutchins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrishutchins/\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n",

Masterworks is an alternative investing platform that gives you access to one of the most exclusive and overlooked investments in history: blue-chip art. Masterworks lets regular people invest in paintings by legends like Banksy Basquiat and Warhol without spending millions. In fact, I used masterworks to invest in a 15 million dollar Picasso the other day.\u00a0</p><p>Here\u2019s how it works: Masterworks will buy a painting they think will appreciate well over time, then they securitize that painting with the SEC, so you can invest in it instead of buying the whole thing.

Notes</strong></p><p>Who is Chris Hutchins, and how many episodes of his new podcast, All the Hacks, does he have under his belt thus far? [2:26]</p><p>A few choice pieces of advice anyone should consider when aspiring to start a podcast: you don\u2019t have to commit forever, only do this if you\u2019d do it for free, and don\u2019t worry about how big (or small) your audience is. [4:30]</p><p>Don\u2019t commit to forever, but start with a reasonable number of episodes to aim for (Tim chose six). If you don\u2019t love the direction it\u2019s going, change direction until you do. Choose a game you can win. [6:50]</p><p>Expect technical SNAFUs. Always have a backup plan. Better: have several. \u201cTwo is one, and one is none.\u201d [11:40]</p><p>Is it still early in the days of podcasting and ripe with opportunity, or is it too crowded and people should consider new mediums for content? [12:55]</p><p>Why did Chris want to start a podcast, and what has made it worthwhile to continue? [17:04]</p><p>Gear Tim uses and why most of his podcast conversations are done remotely. [20:27]</p><p>How many technical difficulties would Tim endure before just rescheduling an interview? What precautions does Tim take to make this less likely? [23:04]</p><p>An easy way to test if your remote guest\u2019s external mic is selected. [27:44]</p><p>Tim once advised podcasters against recording on video, but he\u2019s changed my tune. What are the pros and cons? [27:26]</p><p>How different did his operation look when Tim was just getting started, and how has it evolved over time with the addition of metrics for monetization and staff to assist with production? [32:24]</p><p>What Chris has considered when weighing the rewards of monetization versus its costs, and Tim\u2019s two cents\u2019 worth on sponsorship best practices and options available. (Bonus: why Tim\u2019s books aren\u2019t available in paperback.) [37:03]</p><p>Can\u2019t get big-name guests? Prioritize getting good guests even if they\u2019re not household names. People like good content more than they like bad content with a fancy name (and you\u2019ll probably like not having to get through a phalanx of publicists and lawyers and managers for a year to get that \u201cfamous\u201d but potentially less interesting guest). [48:29]</p><p>How Tim has found guests from the very beginning. [52:18]</p><p>Tim\u2019s thoughts on Chris\u2019 interview with Leigh Rowan (note: not a household name, but an incredible guest who brought his A game). [53:53]</p><p>You may not be able to \u201cfix\u201d a bad guest no matter how well-practiced you are as an interviewer. But you can always record long and edit liberally. [55:26]</p><p>Questions Tim asks and conversations he\u2019ll have with guests to put them at ease and get them to a place where they can trust the process. [57:09]</p><p>Why Tim finds Twitter to be an excellent, low-risk way to source guests. But there are right ways and wrong ways to go about it. [1:01:20]</p><p>Illustrating the importance of technical redundancy, Chris confesses that he had to re-record the interview with Leigh Rowan from scratch. At least it was a lesson learned on day one. [1:07:52]</p><p>The value of reading transcripts (and, perhaps more painfully, audience feedback on social media) of your interviews early on in order to improve, as well as other methods of soliciting torture from select friends for personal development. [1:10:00]</p><p>Why becoming a better interviewer is really becoming your best self as an interviewer. Remember: what\u2019s worked for Joe Rogan or James Lipton or Larry King may not work for you. [1:17:04]</p><p>How long does Tim spend on prep prior to an interview? What are some helpful shortcuts and processes to squeeze the most juice out of this time? [1:21:22]</p><p>Has Tim ever done too much research before an interview \u2014 to the point that the ensuing conversation was devoid of any meaningful surprises? [1:27:15]</p><p>What might cause Tim to push pause on publishing an interview, and how would he break the news diplomatically to the guest? What efforts can be made to salvage something useful from the experience for both parties? [1:30:13]</p><p>Does Tim always read a guest\u2019s new book before he interviews them? [1:32:06]</p><p>Has Tim ever had to pause during an interview to regroup and replan its direction? What steps do I take to make sure the guest and I sound as good as possible? [1:34:31]</p><p>How did Tim build an understanding of his guests, and what did he learn about relating to an audience from Wait But Why\u2018s Tim Urban? [1:38:37]</p><p>Tip: How to avoid getting your AirPods case mixed up with a significant other/family member/roommate who lives with you. [1:43:58]</p><p>Does Tim pay attention to number of podcast downloads and other listener-quantifying metrics? What would motivate extra scrutiny of those numbers? [1:45:19]</p><p>Why you probably want to funnel your listeners to your own website instead of something like a Facebook page that uses algorithims you can\u2019t control. [1:50:00]</p><p>Is growth as important as creating good content? What are the most effective ways to grow an audience that will find that good content? [1:55:14]</p><p>Is there a point to putting audio-only content on a video platform like YouTube? While growth has no magic bullet and the tools are forever changing, here are some evergreen references that might help you find the anchor that will work for your needs. [2:01:00]</p><p>Want to be of the best service to yourself and your audience? Stop trying to please all of the people all of the time. Find the cadence, content, and frequency that fulfills you first. [2:04:35]</p><p>Someone might tune in to your podcast for a certain guest, but if they come back, it\u2019s because of you. This being said, is it necessary to go out of your way to remind listeners that you exist in every episode? [2:08:15]</p><p>How can you make your good question a great question while making your guest sound even smarter and get your listeners personally invested in the conversation? [2:10:18]</p><p>What is one of Chris\u2019 best investments? [2:13:05]</p><p>How (and why) did Tim make the transition from being \u201cThe 4-Hour Guy\u201d to the host of The Tim Ferriss Show (rather than starting something like The 4-Hour Podcast)? [2:14:11]</p><p>You have a personal brand (even if you\u2019ve never tried to build one). But how do you know what it entails? [2:25:08]</p><p>To eliminate the bother of selling ads and securing sponsors, is it worth it to join a podcast network that promises to take care of monetization for you (for a hefty cut)? [2:27:50]</p><p>How does Tim handle a follow-up question if he\u2019s thought of it well past the point it would make sense to fit it into the conversation? [2:36:52]</p><p>Does Tim have any tactics for getting introductions to potential guests from other people in my existing network? [2:38:33]</p><p>A question you can ask to improve your interviewing prowess (courtesy of Adam Grant). [2:40:18]</p><p>What kind of processes does Tim go through when he reassess the direction of the podcast after reaching a preestablished milestone? [2:42:27]</p><p>The time-saving power of batching recording sessions. [2:44:54]</p><p>Parting thoughts.

Notes</strong></p><p>Who is Chris Hutchins, and how many episodes of his new podcast, All the Hacks, does he have under his belt thus far? [2:26]</p><p>A few choice pieces of advice anyone should consider when aspiring to start a podcast: you don\u2019t have to commit forever, only do this if you\u2019d do it for free, and don\u2019t worry about how big (or small) your audience is. [4:30]</p><p>Don\u2019t commit to forever, but start with a reasonable number of episodes to aim for (Tim chose six). If you don\u2019t love the direction it\u2019s going, change direction until you do. Choose a game you can win. [6:50]</p><p>Expect technical SNAFUs. Always have a backup plan. Better: have several. \u201cTwo is one, and one is none.\u201d [11:40]</p><p>Is it still early in the days of podcasting and ripe with opportunity, or is it too crowded and people should consider new mediums for content? [12:55]</p><p>Why did Chris want to start a podcast, and what has made it worthwhile to continue? [17:04]</p><p>Gear Tim uses and why most of his podcast conversations are done remotely. [20:27]</p><p>How many technical difficulties would Tim endure before just rescheduling an interview? What precautions does Tim take to make this less likely? [23:04]</p><p>An easy way to test if your remote guest\u2019s external mic is selected. [27:44]</p><p>Tim once advised podcasters against recording on video, but he\u2019s changed my tune. What are the pros and cons? [27:26]</p><p>How different did his operation look when Tim was just getting started, and how has it evolved over time with the addition of metrics for monetization and staff to assist with production? [32:24]</p><p>What Chris has considered when weighing the rewards of monetization versus its costs, and Tim\u2019s two cents\u2019 worth on sponsorship best practices and options available. (Bonus: why Tim\u2019s books aren\u2019t available in paperback.) [37:03]</p><p>Can\u2019t get big-name guests? Prioritize getting good guests even if they\u2019re not household names. People like good content more than they like bad content with a fancy name (and you\u2019ll probably like not having to get through a phalanx of publicists and lawyers and managers for a year to get that \u201cfamous\u201d but potentially less interesting guest). [48:29]</p><p>How Tim has found guests from the very beginning. [52:18]</p><p>Tim\u2019s thoughts on Chris\u2019 interview with Leigh Rowan (note: not a household name, but an incredible guest who brought his A game). [53:53]</p><p>You may not be able to \u201cfix\u201d a bad guest no matter how well-practiced you are as an interviewer. But you can always record long and edit liberally. [55:26]</p><p>Questions Tim asks and conversations he\u2019ll have with guests to put them at ease and get them to a place where they can trust the process. [57:09]</p><p>Why Tim finds Twitter to be an excellent, low-risk way to source guests. But there are right ways and wrong ways to go about it. [1:01:20]</p><p>Illustrating the importance of technical redundancy, Chris confesses that he had to re-record the interview with Leigh Rowan from scratch. At least it was a lesson learned on day one. [1:07:52]</p><p>The value of reading transcripts (and, perhaps more painfully, audience feedback on social media) of your interviews early on in order to improve, as well as other methods of soliciting torture from select friends for personal development. [1:10:00]</p><p>Why becoming a better interviewer is really becoming your best self as an interviewer. Remember: what\u2019s worked for Joe Rogan or James Lipton or Larry King may not work for you. [1:17:04]</p><p>How long does Tim spend on prep prior to an interview? What are some helpful shortcuts and processes to squeeze the most juice out of this time? [1:21:22]</p><p>Has Tim ever done too much research before an interview \u2014 to the point that the ensuing conversation was devoid of any meaningful surprises? [1:27:15]</p><p>What might cause Tim to push pause on publishing an interview, and how would he break the news diplomatically to the guest? What efforts can be made to salvage something useful from the experience for both parties? [1:30:13]</p><p>Does Tim always read a guest\u2019s new book before he interviews them? [1:32:06]</p><p>Has Tim ever had to pause during an interview to regroup and replan its direction? What steps do I take to make sure the guest and I sound as good as possible? [1:34:31]</p><p>How did Tim build an understanding of his guests, and what did he learn about relating to an audience from Wait But Why\u2018s Tim Urban? [1:38:37]</p><p>Tip: How to avoid getting your AirPods case mixed up with a significant other/family member/roommate who lives with you. [1:43:58]</p><p>Does Tim pay attention to number of podcast downloads and other listener-quantifying metrics? What would motivate extra scrutiny of those numbers? [1:45:19]</p><p>Why you probably want to funnel your listeners to your own website instead of something like a Facebook page that uses algorithims you can\u2019t control. [1:50:00]</p><p>Is growth as important as creating good content? What are the most effective ways to grow an audience that will find that good content? [1:55:14]</p><p>Is there a point to putting audio-only content on a video platform like YouTube? While growth has no magic bullet and the tools are forever changing, here are some evergreen references that might help you find the anchor that will work for your needs. [2:01:00]</p><p>Want to be of the best service to yourself and your audience? Stop trying to please all of the people all of the time. Find the cadence, content, and frequency that fulfills you first. [2:04:35]</p><p>Someone might tune in to your podcast for a certain guest, but if they come back, it\u2019s because of you. This being said, is it necessary to go out of your way to remind listeners that you exist in every episode? [2:08:15]</p><p>How can you make your good question a great question while making your guest sound even smarter and get your listeners personally invested in the conversation? [2:10:18]</p><p>What is one of Chris\u2019 best investments? [2:13:05]</p><p>How (and why) did Tim make the transition from being \u201cThe 4-Hour Guy\u201d to the host of The Tim Ferriss Show (rather than starting something like The 4-Hour Podcast)? [2:14:11]</p><p>You have a personal brand (even if you\u2019ve never tried to build one). But how do you know what it entails? [2:25:08]</p><p>To eliminate the bother of selling ads and securing sponsors, is it worth it to join a podcast network that promises to take care of monetization for you (for a hefty cut)? [2:27:50]</p><p>How does Tim handle a follow-up question if he\u2019s thought of it well past the point it would make sense to fit it into the conversation? [2:36:52]</p><p>Does Tim have any tactics for getting introductions to potential guests from other people in my existing network? [2:38:33]</p><p>A question you can ask to improve your interviewing prowess (courtesy of Adam Grant). [2:40:18]</p><p>What kind of processes does Tim go through when he reassess the direction of the podcast after reaching a preestablished milestone? [2:42:27]</p><p>The time-saving power of batching recording sessions. [2:44:54]</p><p>Parting thoughts.

[1:50:00]\nIs growth as important as creating good content? What are the most effective ways to grow an audience that will find that good content? [1:55:14]\nIs there a point to putting audio-only content on a video platform like YouTube? While growth has no magic bullet and the tools are forever changing, here are some evergreen references that might help you find the anchor that will work for your needs. [2:01:00]\nWant to be of the best service to yourself and your audience? Stop trying to please all of the people all of the time. Find the cadence, content, and frequency that fulfills you first. [2:04:35]\nSomeone might tune in to your podcast for a certain guest, but if they come back, it\u2019s because of you. This being said, is it necessary to go out of your way to remind listeners that you exist in every episode? [2:08:15]\nHow can you make your good question a great question while making your guest sound even smarter and get your listeners personally invested in the conversation? [2:10:18]\nWhat is one of Chris\u2019 best investments? [2:13:05]\nHow (and why) did Tim make the transition from being \u201cThe 4-Hour Guy\u201d to the host of The Tim Ferriss Show (rather than starting something like The 4-Hour Podcast)? [2:14:11]\nYou have a personal brand (even if you\u2019ve never tried to build one). But how do you know what it entails? [2:25:08]\nTo eliminate the bother of selling ads and securing sponsors, is it worth it to join a podcast network that promises to take care of monetization for you (for a hefty cut)? [2:27:50]\nHow does Tim handle a follow-up question if he\u2019s thought of it well past the point it would make sense to fit it into the conversation? [2:36:52]\nDoes Tim have any tactics for getting introductions to potential guests from other people in my existing network? [2:38:33]\nA question you can ask to improve your interviewing prowess (courtesy of Adam Grant). [2:40:18]\nWhat kind of processes does Tim go through when he reassess the direction of the podcast after reaching a preestablished milestone? [2:42:27]\nThe time-saving power of batching recording sessions. [2:44:54]\nParting thoughts.
