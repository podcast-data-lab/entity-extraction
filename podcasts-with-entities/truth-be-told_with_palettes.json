As people of color we ALL have had our fair share of those \u201cunintentionally\u201d painful encounters.\nIn this episode of Truth be Told, Tonya and Code Switch host Gene Demby tackle two questions from people struggling with how to deal with well-meaning white folks, at home and at work.\nWhy the The Tower Tarot Card?\n\u00a0The Tower card is rarely a welcome sight because it signifies chaos, destruction and turmoil. However, the Tower can also signify transformation and the building of new systems and modes of being. The Tower card represents this episode of Truth Be Told because it speaks to both the systemic pain \u201cwell-meaning\u201d white folks can inflict on people of color as well as our power to overcome the limiting structures that make that possible.",
