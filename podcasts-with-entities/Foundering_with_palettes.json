Its goal, he said, is to place electrodes in our brains so we can control a computer with our thoughts. Its experiments have so far been limited to rodents and monkeys, but Neuralink builds on strides already made in medicine, where doctors have successfully placed implants into human brains to treat a variety of illnesses. This week on Decrypted, Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Sarah McBride visits the primate lab that\u2019s been carrying out Neuralink\u2019s research, and meets the doctors and the patients at the forefront of this emerging field.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

An end to Iran's isolation pointed to a bright future for the country's budding tech scene -- but then, Donald Trump, a vocal critic of the nuclear agreement, won the U.S. presidency and once-eager foreign investors got spooked. This week on Decrypted, Bloomberg's Ladane Nasseri visits the founders of a homegrown e-commerce startup called Koodakoo as well as several other companies. These young entrepreneurs are awaiting Trump's next move -- and what his actions would mean for the future of their businesses -- as he threatens to renegotiate and even withdraw from the nuclear agreement.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

For one, consider this stat: China has created as many billion-dollar startups this year as the U.S. This week, Bloomberg Technology's Peter Elstrom and David Ramli travel to Shanghai to visit Colin Huang, the man behind the latest business to join this rarefied club of unicorns. Huang recounts his humble origins in Hangzhou and the various turning points in his life that took him to where he is today, at the center of China's bustling tech scene. At 37, now leading his fourth startup, Huang's just getting started.\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

In the absence of the strict rules governing public companies, are Silicon Valley's entrepreneurs getting away with too much?\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."
