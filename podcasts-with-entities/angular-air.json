IoT support in the open source community.\u00a0\n\nZach: How we think about\nIoT application development: Personify rooms and devices, enable them to answer\nquestions. Environment data (i.e. sensors, occupants) result in frequent I/O\nfor apps. Lot of states to track.\u00a0\n\nAtticus: Some IoT labs\nworked on\n\nGrocery\nlist automation: Barcode scanner + rPi + Node\n\nMotion\nsensor night light: Motion sensor + Arduino + rPi + Node + Hue lights\u00a0\n\nHow do you decide on what\nto build next? \n\nHow do you guys use\nAngular?\u00a0\n\nZach: Highly\ntask/location-centric apps running on dedicated devices. Interesting side\neffect is more freedom to use new DOM safely.\n\n\n\nIoT and security\n\nIoT allows access to sometimes devices inside our homes and\nbusinesses. Adding more libraries and frameworks on top adds to the security\nheadache. What precautions do we as developers should take? Good practices? How\nto test it?\n\n\n\nWhere do you see IoT going\nin the future? What\u2019s next?\n\n\n\nFinal 10 Minutes\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://tessel.io\n\nhttps://developer.nest.com\n\nhttp://johnny-five.io\n\n\nhttp://dweet.io \n\n\n\nTips\n& Picks\u00a0\n\nAri\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Picks: Go to Death Valley.
