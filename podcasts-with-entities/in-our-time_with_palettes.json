While the European crowns negotiated treaties to try to manage relations with the corsairs, they commonly viewed these sailors as pirates who were barely tolerated and, as soon as France, Britain, Spain and later America developed enough sea power, their ships and bases were destroyed. </p><p>With</p><p>Joanna Nolan\nResearch Associate at SOAS, University of London</p><p>Claire Norton\nFormer Associate Professor of History at St Mary\u2019s University, Twickenham</p><p>And Michael Talbot\nAssociate Professor in the History of the Ottoman Empire and the Modern Middle East at the University of Greenwich</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson </p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Robert C.

                "summary": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the anchoress and mystic who, in the late fourteenth century, wrote about her visions of Christ suffering, in a work since known as Revelations of Divine Love.  She is probably the first named woman writer in English, even if questions about her name and life remain open. Her account is an exploration of the meaning of her visions and is vivid and bold, both in its imagery and theology. From her confined cell in a Norwich parish church, in a land beset with plague, she dealt with the nature of sin and with the feminine side of God,  and shared the message she received that God is love and, famously, that all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well.</p><p>With</p><p>Katherine Lewis\nProfessor of Medieval History at the University of Huddersfield</p><p>Philip Sheldrake\nProfessor of Christian Spirituality at the Oblate School of Theology, Texas and Senior Research Associate of the Von Hugel Institute, University of Cambridge</p><p>And </p><p>Laura Kalas\nSenior Lecturer in Medieval English Literature at Swansea University</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>John H.

He was read widely and widely heard: with his reading tours in America and recordings of his works that sold in their hundreds of thousands after his death, he is credited with reviving the act of poetry as performance in the 20th century.</p><p>With</p><p>Nerys Williams\nAssociate Professor of Poetry and Poetics at University College Dublin</p><p>John Goodby\nProfessor of Arts and Culture at Sheffield Hallam University</p><p>And</p><p>Leo Mellor\nThe Roma Gill Fellow in English at Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>"

                "summary": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Thomas Hardy (1840 -1928) and his commitment to poetry, which he prized far above his novels.  In the 1890s, once he had earned enough from his fiction, Hardy stopped writing novels altogether and returned to the poetry he had largely put aside since his twenties.  He hoped that he might be ranked one day alongside Shelley and Byron, worthy of inclusion in a collection such as Palgrave's Golden Treasury which had inspired him. Hardy kept writing poems for the rest of his life, in different styles and metres, and he explored genres from nature,  to war, to epic.  Among his best known are what he called his Poems of 1912 to 13, responding to his grief at the death of his first wife, Emma (1840 -1912), who he credited as the one who had made it possible for him to leave his work as an architect's clerk and to write the novels that made him famous.</p><p>With</p><p>Mark Ford\nPoet, and Professor of English and American Literature, University College London.</p><p>Jane Thomas\nEmeritus Professor of English at the University of Hull and Senior Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Leeds</p><p>And </p><p>Tim Armstrong\nProfessor of Modern English and American Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>"

In her lifetime she was most celebrated for her novels such as The Bell and The Black Prince, but these are now sharing the spotlight with her philosophy.  Responding to the horrors of the Second World War, she argued that morality was not subjective or a matter of taste, as many of her contemporaries held, but was objective, and good was a fact we could recognize.  To tell good from bad, though, we would need to see the world as it really is, not as we want to see it, and her novels are full of characters who are not yet enlightened enough to do that.</p><p>With</p><p>Anil Gomes\nFellow and Tutor in Philosophy at Trinity College, University of Oxford</p><p>Anne Rowe\nVisiting Professor at the University of Chichester and Emeritus Research Fellow with the Iris Murdoch Archive Project at Kingston University</p><p>And</p><p>Miles Leeson\nDirector of the Iris Murdoch Research Centre and Reader in English Literature at the University of Chichester</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>"

Decline and Fall covers thirteen centuries and is an enormous intellectual undertaking and, on publication, it became a phenomenal success across Europe.  </p><p>The image above is of Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton, oil on mahogany panel, 1773.</p><p>With</p><p>David Womersley\nThe Thomas Wharton Professor of English Literature at St Catherine\u2019s College, University of Oxford</p><p>Charlotte Roberts\nLecturer in English at University College London</p><p>And </p><p>Karen O\u2019Brien\nProfessor of English Literature at the University of Oxford</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>"

His works have been preserved in greater number than any of the poets of his age, even Virgil, and have been among the most influential.  The versions of many of the Greek and Roman myths we know today were his work, as told in his epic Metamorphoses and, together with his works on Love and the Art of Love, have inspired and disturbed readers from the time they were created. Despite being the most prominent poet in Augustan Rome at the time, he was exiled from Rome to Tomis on the Black Sea Coast where he remained until he died.   It is thought that the 'carmen' that led to his exile was the Art of Love, Ars Amatoria, supposedly scandalising Augustus, but the 'error' was not disclosed.</p><p>With </p><p>Maria Wyke\nProfessor of Latin at University College London</p><p>Gail Trimble\nBrown Fellow and Tutor in Classics at Trinity College at the University of Oxford</p><p>And </p><p>Dunstan Lowe\nSenior Lecturer in Latin Literature at the University of Kent</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>"

Scientists are still trying to establish exactly what happened, when and why, but this was not as sudden as when an asteroid hits Earth.  The Devonian Period had seen the first trees and soils and it had such a diversity of sea life that it\u2019s known as the Age of Fishes, some of them massive and armoured, and, in one of the iconic stages in evolution, some of them moving onto land for the first time.  One of the most important theories for the first stage of this extinction is that the new soils washed into oceans, leading to algal blooms that left the waters without oxygen and suffocated the marine life. </p><p>The image above is an abstract group of the huge, armoured Dunkleosteus fish, lost in the Late Devonian Extinction</p><p>With </p><p>Jessica Whiteside\nAssociate Professor of Geochemistry in the Department of Ocean and Earth Science at the University of Southampton</p><p>David Bond\nProfessor of Geology at the University of Hull</p><p>And</p><p>Mike Benton\nProfessor of Vertebrate Paleontology at the School of Life Sciences, University of Bristol.</p>"

Napoleon\u2019s soldiers found it in a Mamluk fort at Rosetta on the Egyptian coast, and soon realised the Greek words could be used to unlock the hieroglyphs.

He wrote poetry and many letters, hundreds of which survive and provide insight into his life and times. He was born in or near York and spent most of his life in Northumbria before accepting an invitation to Charlemagne's court in Aachen. To this he brought Anglo-Saxon humanism, encouraging a broad liberal education for itself and the better to understand Christian doctrine. He left to be abbot at Marmoutier, Tours, where the monks were developing the Carolingian script that influenced the Roman typeface. </p><p>The image above is Alcuin\u2019s portrait, found in a copy of the Bible made at his monastery in Tours during the rule of his successor Abbot Adalhard (834\u2013843).

Lawrence (1888 \u2013 1935), better known as Lawrence of Arabia, a topic drawn from over 1200 suggestions for our Listener Week 2019.  Although Lawrence started as an archaeologist in the Middle East, when World War I broke out he joined the British army and became an intelligence officer. His contact with a prominent Arab leader, Sharif Hussein, made him sympathetic to Hussein\u2019s cause and during the Arab Revolt of 1916 he not only served the British but also the interests of Hussein.  After the war he was dismayed by the peace settlement and felt that the British had broken an assurance that Sharif Hussein would lead a new Arab kingdom.  Lawrence was made famous by the work of Lowell Thomas, whose film of Lawrence drew huge audiences in 1919, which led to his own book Seven Pillars of Wisdom and David Lean\u2019s 1962 film with Peter O'Toole.</p><p>In previous Listener Weeks, we've discussed Kafka's The Trial, The Voyages of Captain Cook, Garibaldi and the Risorgimento, Moby Dick and The Thirty Years War.</p><p>With </p><p>Hussein Omar \nLecturer in Modern Global History at University College Dublin </p><p>Catriona Pennell \nAssociate Professor of Modern History and Memory Studies at the University of Exeter</p><p>Neil Faulkner \nDirector of Military History Live and Editor of the magazine Military History Matters</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>"

He became famous in France and abroad for decades, rivalled only by Einstein and, in the years after the Dreyfus Affair, was the first ever Jewish member of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise.

Great white sharks can produce up to 100,000 teeth in their lifetimes.  For humans, it is closer to a mere 50 and most of those have to last from childhood.  Looking back half a billion years, though, the ancestors of sharks and humans had no teeth in their mouths at all, nor jaws.  They were armoured fish, sucking in their food.  The theory is that either their tooth-like scales began to appear in mouths as teeth, or some of their taste buds became harder.  If we knew more about that, and why sharks can regenerate their teeth, then we might learn how humans could grow new teeth in later lives. </p><p>With </p><p>Gareth Fraser\nAssistant Professor in Biology at the University of Florida</p><p>Zerina Johanson\nMerit Researcher in the Department of Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum</p><p>and </p><p>Philip Donoghue\nProfessor of Palaeobiology at the University of Bristol</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>"

A symbol of a woman's power and the defiance of political tyranny, the image of Judith has been sculpted by Donatello, painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and, in the case of Caravaggio, Liss and Artemisia Gentileschi, been shown with vivid, disturbing detail.  What do these interpretations reveal of the attitudes to power and women in their time, and of the artists' own experiences? </p><p>The image of Judith, above is from a tapestry in the Duomo, Milan, by Giovanni or Nicola Carcher, 1555</p><p>With </p><p>Susan Foister\nCurator of Early Netherlandish, German and British Painting at the National Gallery</p><p>John Gash\nSenior Lecturer in History of Art at the University of Aberdeen</p><p>And </p><p>Ela Nutu Hall\nResearch Associate at the Sheffield Institute for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies, at the University of Sheffield</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>"

In works such as Waiting for Godot, Endgame, Molloy and Malone Dies, he wanted to show the limitations of language, what words could not do, together with the absurdity and humour of the human condition.  In part he was reacting to the verbal omnipotence of James Joyce, with whom he\u2019d worked in Paris, and in part to his experience in the French Resistance during World War 2, when he used code, writing not to reveal meaning but to conceal it.</p><p>With</p><p>Steven Connor\nProfessor of English at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Laura Salisbury\nProfessor of Modern Literature at the University of Exeter</p><p>And </p><p>Mark Nixon\nAssociate Professor in Modern Literature at the University of Reading and co-director of the Beckett International Foundation</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>"

He kept writing, and his ideas went on to influence David Hume and Adam Smith, as well as Keynes and Hayek.</p><p>With </p><p>David Wootton\nAnniversary Professor of History at the University of York</p><p>Helen Paul\nLecturer in Economics and Economic History at the University of Southampton</p><p>And </p><p>John Callanan\nSenior Lecturer in Philosophy at King\u2019s College London</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>"

After more than a century of upheaval, the Clearances left an indelible mark on the people and landscape of the Highlands and Western Isles.</p><p>The image above is a detail from a print of 'Lochaber No More' by John Watson Nicol 1856-1926</p><p>With </p><p>Sir Tom Devine\nProfessor Emeritus of Scottish History at the University of Edinburgh</p><p>Marjory Harper\nProfessor of History at the University of Aberdeen and Visiting Professor at the University of the Highlands and Islands</p><p>And</p><p>Murray Pittock\nBradley Professor of English Literature and Pro Vice Principal at the University of Glasgow</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>"

In 1565, Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman leader, sent a great fleet west to lay siege to Malta and capture it for his empire. Victory would mean control of trade across the Mediterranean and a base for attacks on Spain, Sicily and southern Italy, even Rome.

                "summary": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the man who was Henry II's Chancellor and then Archbishop of Canterbury and who was murdered by knights in Canterbury Cathedral (depicted by Matthew Paris, above). Henry believed that Becket owed him loyalty as he had raised him to the highest offices, and that he should agree to Henry's courts having jurisdiction over 'criminous clerics'. They fell out when Becket agreed to this jurisdiction verbally but would not put his seal on the agreement, the Constitutions of Clarendon. The rift deepened when Henry's heir was crowned without Becket, who excommunicated the bishops who took part. Becket's tomb became one of the main destinations for pilgrims for the next 400 years, including those in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales where he was the 'blisful martir'. </p><p>With </p><p>Laura Ashe\nAssociate Professor of English at Worcester College, University of Oxford</p><p>Michael Staunton\nAssociate Professor in History at University College Dublin</p><p>And</p><p>Danica Summerlin\nLecturer in Medieval History at the University of Sheffield</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>"

It is the story of Heathcliff, a foundling from Liverpool brought up in the Earnshaw family at the remote Wuthering Heights, high on the moors, who becomes close to the young Cathy Earnshaw but hears her say she can never marry him.

For millennia, humans set their calendars to birds' annual arrivals, and speculated about what happened when they departed, perhaps moving deep under water, or turning into fish or shellfish, or hibernating while clinging to trees upside down. Ideas about migration developed in C19th when, in Germany, a stork was noticed with an African spear in its neck, indicating where it had been over the winter and how far it had flown. Today there are many ideas about how birds use their senses of sight and smell, and magnetic fields, to find their way, and about why and how birds choose their destinations and many questions. Why do some scatter and some flock together, how much is instinctive and how much is learned, and how far do the benefits the migrating birds gain outweigh the risks they face?</p><p>With </p><p>Barbara Helm\nReader at the Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the University of Glasgow</p><p>Tim Guilford\nProfessor of Animal Behaviour and Tutorial Fellow of Zoology at Merton College, Oxford</p><p>and </p><p>Richard Holland\nSenior Lecturer in Animal Cognition at Bangor University</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>"

It extends from where Neptune is, which is 30 times further out than the Earth is from the Sun, to about 500 times the Earth-Sun distance. It covers an immense region of space and it is the part of the Solar System that we know the least about, because it is so remote from us and has been barely detectable by Earth-based telescopes until recent decades.

As over ninety-nine percent of all observable matter in the Universe is plasma, planets like ours, with so little plasma and so much solid, liquid and gas, appear all the more remarkable. On the grand scale, plasma is what the Sun is made from and, when we look into the night sky, almost everything we can see with the naked eye is made of plasma. On the smallest scale, here on Earth, scientists make plasma to etch the microchips on which we rely for so much. Plasma is in the fluorescent light bulbs above our heads and, in laboratories around the world, it is the subject of tests to create, one day, an inexhaustible and clean source of energy from nuclear fusion.</p><p>With </p><p>Justin Wark\nProfessor of Physics and Fellow of Trinity College at the University of Oxford</p><p>Kate Lancaster\nResearch Fellow for Innovation and Impact at the York Plasma Institute at the University of York</p><p>and </p><p>Bill Graham\nProfessor of Physics at Queens University, Belfast</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>"

Shakespeare also explored the concept through Richard II and the king's two bodies, Hobbes developed it in the 17th Century, and the idea of popular sovereignty was tested in the Revolutionary era in America and France. </p><p>With </p><p>Melissa Lane\nClass of 1943 Professor of Politics at Princeton University</p><p>Richard Bourke\nProfessor in the History of Political Thought at Queen Mary University of London</p><p>and </p><p>Tim Stanton\nSenior Lecturer in the Department of Politics at the University of York</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>"
