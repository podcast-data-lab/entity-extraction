There was a real danger that the city could fall into either tyranny or civil war.\n\nSolon instituted a programme of reforms that transformed Athens\u2019 political and legal systems, its society and economy, so that later generations referred to him as Solon the Lawgiver. \n\nWith\n\nMelissa Lane\nClass of 1943 Professor of Politics at Princeton University\n\nHans van Wees\nGrote Professor of Ancient History at University College London\n\nand\n \nWilliam Allan\nProfessor of Greek and McConnell Laing Tutorial Fellow in Greek and Latin Languages and Literature at University College, University of Oxford \n\nProducer  Luke Mulhall"

During his long career, he made a number of impressive advances in our understanding of maths and developed whole new fields in the subject. \n\nHe was born into a Jewish family in Hungary just before the outbreak of World War I, and his life was shaped by the rise of fascism in Europe, anti-Semitism and the Cold War. His reputation for mathematical problem solving is unrivalled and he was extraordinarily prolific.  He produced more than 1,500 papers and collaborated with around 500 other academics.  \n\nHe also had an unconventional lifestyle. Instead of having a long-term post at one university, he spent much of his life travelling around visiting other mathematicians, often staying for just a few days. \n\nWith \n\nColva Roney-Dougal \nProfessor of Pure Mathematics at the University of St Andrews\n\nTimothy Gowers\nProfessor of Mathematics at the College de France in Paris and Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge\n\nand\n\nAndrew Treglown\nAssociate Professor in Mathematics at the University of Birmingham\n\nThe image above shows a graph occurring in Ramsey Theory.

It is a foundational work of medieval literature, drawing on the myths of Scandinavia and central Europe. The poem tells of two couples, Siegfried and Kriemhild and Gunther and Brunhilda, whose lives are destroyed by lies and revenge. It was extremely popular in its time, sometimes rewritten with happier endings, and was rediscovered by German Romantics and has since been drawn from selectively by Wagner, Fritz Lang and, infamously, the Nazis looking to support ideas on German heritage.\n\nThe image above is of Siegfried seeing Kriemhild for the first time, a miniature from the Hundeshagenschen Code manuscript dating from 15th Century.\n\nWith\n\nSarah Bowden\nReader in German and Medieval Studies at King\u2019s College London\n\nMark Chinca\nProfessor of Medieval German and Comparative Literature at the University of Cambridge\n\nAnd\n\nBettina Bildhauer\nProfessor of Modern Languages at the University of St Andrews\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

The men in her circle could freely paint in busy bars and public spaces, while Morisot captured the domestic world and found new, daring ways to paint quickly in the open air.  Her work shows women as they were, to her: informal, unguarded, and not transformed or distorted for the eyes of men.  The image above is one of her few self-portraits, though several portraits of her survive by other artists, chiefly her sister Edma and her brother-in-law Edouard Manet. \n\nWith \n\nTamar Garb\nProfessor of History of Art at University College London\n\n\nLois Oliver\nCurator at the Royal Academy and Adjunct Professor of Art History at the American University of Notre Dame London.\n\nAnd\n\nClaire Moran\nReader in French at Queen's University Belfast\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

The influence of Orwell's novel is immeasurable, highlighting threats to personal freedom with concepts he named such as doublespeak, thoughtcrime, Room 101, Big Brother, memory hole and thought police.\n\nWith \n\nDavid Dwan\nProfessor of English Literature and Intellectual History at the University of Oxford\n\nLisa Mullen\nTeaching Associate in Modern Contemporary Literature at the University of Cambridge\n\nAnd\n\nJohn Bowen\nProfessor of English Literature at the University of York\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

Du Fu (712-770AD), a few years younger, is more of an everyman, writing in the upheaval of the An Lushan Rebellion (755-763AD). Together they have been a central part of Chinese culture for over a millennium, reflecting the balance between the individual and the public life, and one sign of their enduring appeal is that there is rarely agreement on which of them is the greater.\n\nThe image above is intended to depict Du Fu.\n\nWith \n\nTim Barrett\nProfessor Emeritus of East Asian History at SOAS, University of London\n\nTian Yuan Tan\nShaw Professor of Chinese at the University of Oxford and Professorial Fellow at University College\n\nAnd\n\nFrances Wood\nFormer Curator of the Chinese Collections at the British Library\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

This sets up a conflict between  generations, between the state and the individual, uncle and niece, autocracy and pluralism, and it releases an enormous tragic energy that brings sudden death to Antigone, her fiance Haemon who is also Creon's son, and to Creon's wife Eurydice, while Creon himself is condemned to a living death of grief.\n\nWith\n\nEdith Hall\nProfessor of Classics at Durham University\n\nOliver Taplin\nEmeritus Professor of Classics, University of Oxford\n\nAnd\n\nLyndsay Coo\nSenior Lecturer in Ancient Greek Language and Literature at the University of Bristol\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",

This sets up a conflict between  generations, between the state and the individual, uncle and niece, autocracy and pluralism, and it releases an enormous tragic energy that brings sudden death to Antigone, her fiance Haemon who is also Creon's son, and to Creon's wife Eurydice, while Creon himself is condemned to a living death of grief.\n\nWith\n\nEdith Hall\nProfessor of Classics at Durham University\n\nOliver Taplin\nEmeritus Professor of Classics, University of Oxford\n\nAnd\n\nLyndsay Coo\nSenior Lecturer in Ancient Greek Language and Literature at the University of Bristol\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",

Kropotkin (1842 - 1921) was born into privilege, very much in the highest circle of Russian society as a pageboy for the Tsar, before he became a republican in childhood and dropped the title 'Prince'.  While working in Siberia, he started reading about anarchism and that radicalised him further, as did his observations of Siberian villagers supporting each other without (or despite) a role for the State.  He made a name for himself as a geographer but soon his politics landed him in jail in St Petersburg, from which he escaped to exile in England where he was f\u00eated, with growing fame leading to lecture tours in the USA.  His time in Siberia also inspired his ideas on the importance of mutual aid in evolution, a counter to the dominant idea from Darwin and Huxley that life was a gladiatorial combat in which only the fittest survived.  Kropotkin became such a towering figure in public life that, returning to Russia, he was able to challenge Lenin without reprisal, and Lenin in turn permitted his enormous public funeral there, attended by 20,000 mourners.\n\nWith \n\nRuth Kinna\nProfessor of Political Theory at Loughborough University\n\nLee Dugatkin\nProfessor of Biology at the University of Louisville\n\nAnd\n\nSimon Dixon\nThe Sir Bernard Pares Professor of Russian History at University College London",

Among his best known are what he called his Poems of 1912 to 13, responding to his grief at the death of his first wife, Emma (1840 -1912), who he credited as the one who had made it possible for him to leave his work as an architect's clerk and to write the novels that made him famous.\n\nWith\n\nMark Ford\nPoet, and Professor of English and American Literature, University College London.\n\nJane Thomas\nEmeritus Professor of English at the University of Hull and Senior Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Leeds\n\nAnd \n\nTim Armstrong\nProfessor of Modern English and American Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

China had supported the Allies, sending workers to dig trenches, and expected to regain the German colonies on its territory, but the Allies and China's leaders chose to give that land to Japan instead.

                "summary": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Anne Bronte's second novel, published in 1848, which is now celebrated alongside those of her sisters but which Charlotte Bronte tried to suppress as a 'mistake'. It examines the life of Helen, who has escaped her abusive husband Arthur Huntingdon with their son to live at Wildfell Hall as a widow under the alias 'Mrs Graham', and it exposes the men in her husband's circle who gave her no choice but to flee. Early critics attacked the novel as coarse, as misrepresenting male behaviour, and as something no woman or girl should ever read; soon after Anne's death, Charlotte suggested the publisher should lose it for good. In recent decades, though, its reputation has climbed and it now sits with Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights as one of the great novels by the Bronte sisters.\n\nThe image above shows Tara Fitzgerald as Helen Graham in a 1996 BBC adaptation.\n\nWith\n\nAlexandra Lewis\nLecturer in English and Creative Writing at the University of Newcastle (Australia)\n\nMarianne Thorm\u00e4hlen\nProfessor Emerita in English Studies, Lund University\n\nAnd\n\nJohn Bowen\nProfessor of Nineteenth Century Literature at the University of York\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

                "summary": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the period between the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the unexpected restoration of his son Charles II in 1660, known as The Interregnum.  It was marked in England by an elusive pursuit of stability, with serious consequences in Scotland and notorious ones in Ireland.  When Parliament executed Charles it had also killed Scotland and Ireland\u2019s king, without their consent; Scotland immediately declared Charles II king of Britain, and Ireland too favoured Charles.  In the interests of political and financial security, Parliament's forces, led by Oliver Cromwell, soon invaded Ireland and then turned to defeating Scotland. However, the improvised power structures in England did not last and Oliver Cromwell's death in 1658 was followed by the threat of anarchy.  In England, Charles II had some success in overturning the changes of the 1650s but there were lasting consequences for Scotland and the notorious changes in Ireland were entrenched.\n\nThe Dutch image of Oliver Cromwell, above, was published by Joost Hartgers c1649\n\nWith \n\nClare Jackson\nSenior Tutor at Trinity Hall, University of Cambridge\n\nMiche\u00e1l \u00d3 Siochr\u00fa \nProfessor in Modern History at Trinity College Dublin\n\nAnd\n\nLaura Stewart\nProfessor in Early Modern History at the University of York\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

For those able and willing to travel, there were countless destinations from Jerusalem, Rome and Santiago de Compostela to the smaller  local shrines associated with miracles and relics of the saints.  Meanwhile, for those unable or not allowed to travel there were journeys of the mind, inspired by guidebooks that would tell the faithful how many steps they could take around their homes to replicate the walk to the main destinations in Rome and the Holy Land, passing paintings of the places on their route. \n\nThe image above is of a badge of St Thomas of Canterbury, worn by pilgrims who had journeyed to his shrine.\n\nWith\n\nMiri Rubin\nProfessor of Medieval and Early Modern History at Queen Mary, University of London\n\nKathryn Rudy\nProfessor of Art History at the University of St Andrews\n\nAnd\n\nAnthony Bale\nProfessor of Medieval Studies and Dean of the School of Arts at Birkbeck, University of London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

To his peers, he was ranked with Einstein and, when he moved to America in his retirement, he was welcomed as if he were Shakespeare. Born in Bristol, he trained as an engineer before developing theories in his twenties that changed the understanding of quantum mechanics, bringing him a Nobel Prize in 1933 which he shared with Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.  He continued to make deep contributions, bringing abstract maths to physics, beyond predicting anti-particles as he did in his Dirac Equation.\n\nWith \n\nGraham Farmelo\nBiographer of Dirac and Fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge\n\nValerie Gibson\nProfessor of High Energy Physics at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Trinity College\n\nAnd\n\nDavid Berman\nProfessor of Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary University of London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

When the French government surrendered Paris to the Prussians, power gravitated to the National Guard in the city and to radical socialists, and a Commune established in March 1871 with the red flag replacing the trilcoleur.  The French government sent in the army and, after bloody fighting, the Communards were defeated by the end of May 1871.\n\nThe image above is from an engraving of the fire in the Tuileries Palace, May 23, 1871\n\nWith \n\nKarine Varley\nLecturer in French and European History at the University of Strathclyde\n\nRobert Gildea\nProfessor of Modern History at the University of Oxford\n\nAnd\n\nJulia Nicholls\nLecturer in French and European Studies at King\u2019s College London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

From its origins in Ethiopia, coffea arabica spread through the Ottoman Empire before reaching Western Europe where,  in the 17th century, coffee houses were becoming established.  There, caffeinated customers stayed awake for longer and were more animated, and this helped to spread ideas and influence culture.   Coffee became a colonial product, grown by slaves or indentured labour, with coffea robusta replacing arabica where disease had struck, and was traded extensively by the Dutch and French empires; by the 19th century, Brazil  had developed into a major coffee producer, meeting demand in the USA that had grown on the waggon trails.  \n\nWith \n\nJudith Hawley\nProfessor of 18th Century Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nMarkman Ellis\nProfessor of 18th Century Studies at Queen Mary University of London\n\nAnd\n\nJonathan Morris\nProfessor in Modern History at the University of Hertfordshire\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",

She was married to Fulk from Anjou, on the understanding they would rule together, and for 30 years she vied with him and then their son as they struggled to consolidate their Frankish state in the Holy Land. \n\nThe image above is of the coronation of Fulk with Melisende, from Livre d'Eracles, Guillaume de Tyr (1130?-1186) \nSource: Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France \n\nWith \n\nNatasha Hodgson\nSenior Lecturer in Medieval History and Director of the Centre for the Study of Religion and Conflict at Nottingham Trent University\n\nKatherine Lewis\nSenior Lecturer in History at the University of Huddersfield\n\nand \n\nDanielle Park\nVisiting Lecturer at Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

Burns (1759-1796) was born in Ayrshire and his work as a tenant farmer earned him the label The Ploughman Poet, yet it was the quality of his verse that helped his reputation endure and grow. His work inspired other Romantic poets and his personal story and ideas combined with that, giving his poems a broad strength and appeal - sung by revolutionaries and on Mao's Long March, as well as on New Year's Eve and at Burns Suppers.\n\nWith\n\nRobert Crawford\nProfessor of Modern Scottish Literature and Bishop Wardlaw Professor of Poetry at the University of St Andrews\n\nFiona Stafford\nProfessor of English at the University of Oxford\n\nand \n\nMurray Pittock\nBradley Professor of English Literature and Pro Vice Principal at the University of Glasgow\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

At first he was largely praised for his generosity yet became known for his debauched lifestyle, with allegations he started the Fire of Rome, watching the flames as he played the lyre. Christians saw him as their persecutor, an anti-Christ,  and the number of the Beast in the Book of Revelation was thought to indicate Nero. He had confidence in his own artistry, took up acting (which then had a very low status) and, as revolts in the empire grew, killed himself after the Senate condemned him to die as a slave, on a cross. \n\nWith \n\nMaria Wyke\nProfessor of Latin at University College London\n\nMatthew Nicholls\nFellow and Senior Tutor at St John\u2019s College, University of Oxford\n\nAnd \n\nShushma Malik\nLecturer in Classics at the University of Roehampton\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

The key strategic advantage the invaders had was the Viking ships which were far superior and enabled them to raid from the sea and up rivers very rapidly.  Their Great Army had arrived in the 870s, conquering the kingdom of Northumbria and occupying York.  They defeated the king of Mercia and seized part of his land.  They killed the Anglo-Saxon king of East Anglia and gained control of his territory.  It was only when a smaller force failed to defeat Wessex that the Danelaw came into being, leaving a lasting impact on the people and customs of that area.\n\nWith \n\nJudith Jesch\nProfessor of Viking Studies at the University of Nottingham\n\nJohn Hines\nProfessor of Archaeology at Cardiff University\n\nAnd\n\nJane Kershaw\nERC Principal Investigator in Archaeology at the University of Oxford\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

According to legend, he was born a slave; his mother was an Ethiopian slave, his father an elite Arab cavalryman.  Antarah won his freedom in battle and loved a woman called Abla who refused him, and they were later celebrated in the saga of Antar and Abla. One of Antarah's poems was so esteemed in pre-Islamic Arabia that it is believed it was hung up on the wall of the Kaaba in Mecca. \n\nWith \n\nJames Montgomery\nSir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic at the University of Cambridge\n\nMarl\u00e9 Hammond\nSenior Lecturer in Arabic Popular Literature and Culture at SOAS, University of London\n\nAnd \n\nHarry Munt\nLecturer in Medieval History at the University of York\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson"

He wrote De La D\u00e9mocratie en Am\u00e9rique in two parts, published in 1835 and 1840, when France was ruled by the July Monarchy of Louis-Philippe. Tocqueville was interested in how aspects of American democracy, in the age of President Andrew Jackson, could be applied to Europe as it moved away from rule by monarchs and aristocrats. His work has been revisited by politicians ever since, particularly in America, with its analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of direct democracy and its warnings of mediocrity and the tyranny of the majority.\n\nWith\n\nRobert Gildea\nProfessor of Modern History at the University of Oxford\n\nSusan-Mary Grant\nProfessor of American History at Newcastle University\n\nand \n\nJeremy Jennings\nProfessor of Political Theory and Head of the School of Politics & Economics at King's College London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

What sets them apart is the way members of their group can change colour, camouflage themselves, recognise people, solve problems, squirt ink, power themselves with jet propulsion and survive both on land, briefly, and in the deepest, coldest oceans. And, without bones or shells, they grow so rapidly they can outstrip their rivals when habitats change, making them the great survivors and adaptors of the animal world.\n\nWith\n\nLouise Allcock\nLecturer in Zoology at the National University of Ireland, Galway\n\nPaul Rodhouse\nEmeritus Fellow of the British Antarctic Survey\n\nand\n\nJonathan Ablett\nSenior Curator of Molluscs at the Natural History Museum\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

He disappears and she marries his rival, Edgar Linton, of Thrushcross Grange even though she feels inextricably linked with Heathcliff, exclaiming to her maid 'I am Heathcliff!'

This was a struggle between the Angevin and Capetian dynasties, one that followed Capetian successes over the Angevins in France. The forces of the new boy-king, Henry III, attacked those of Louis of France, the claimant backed by rebel Barons. Henry's regent, William Marshal, was almost seventy when he led the charge on Lincoln that day, and his victory confirmed his reputation as England's greatest knight. Louis sent to France for reinforcements but in August these, too, were defeated at sea, at the Battle of Sandwich.

                "summary": "Melvyn Bragg discusses the life and times of Rosa Luxemburg (1871-1919), 'Red Rosa', who was born in Poland under the Russian Empire and became one of the leading revolutionaries in an age of revolution. She was jailed for agitation and for her campaign against the Great War which, she argued, pitted workers against each other for the sake of capitalism. With Karl Liebknecht and other radicals, she founded the Spartacus League in the hope of ending the war through revolution. She founded the German Communist Party with Liebknecht; with the violence that followed the German Revolution of 1918, her opponents condemned her as Bloody Rosa. She and Liebknecht were seen as ringleaders in the Spartacus Revolt of 1919 and, on 15th January 1919, the Freikorps militia arrested and murdered them. While Luxemburg has faced opposition for her actions and ideas from many quarters, she went on to become an iconic figure in East Germany under the Cold War and a focal point for opposition to the Soviet-backed leadership.\n\nWith \n\nJacqueline Rose\nCo-Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, Birkbeck, University of London\n\nMark Jones\nIrish Research Council fellow at the Centre for War Studies, University College Dublin\n\nand \n\nNadine Rossol\nSenior lecturer in Modern European History at the University of Essex\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

He was a Stoic philosopher, he wrote blood-soaked tragedies, he was an orator, and he navigated his way through the reigns of Caligula, Claudius and Nero, sometimes exercising power at the highest level and at others spending years in exile. Agrippina the Younger was the one who called for him to tutor Nero, and it is thought Seneca helped curb some of Nero's excesses. He was later revered within the Christian church, partly for what he did and partly for what he was said to have done in forged letters to St Paul. His tragedies, with their ghosts and high body count, influenced Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus and Hamlet, and Kyd's Spanish Tragedy.

                "summary": "\"He who saw the Deep\" are the first words of the standard version of The Epic of Gilgamesh, the subject of this discussion between Melvyn Bragg and his guests. Gilgamesh is often said to be the oldest surviving great work of literature, with origins in the third millennium BC, and it passed through thousands of years on cuneiform tablets. Unlike epics of Greece and Rome, the intact story of Gilgamesh became lost to later generations until tablets were discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in 1853 near Mosul and later translated. Since then, many more tablets have been found and much of the text has been reassembled to convey the story of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk the sheepfold, and Enkidu who the gods created to stop Gilgamesh oppressing his people. Together they fight Humbaba, monstrous guardian of the Cedar Forest, and kill the Bull of Heaven, for which the gods make Enkidu mortally ill. Gilgamesh goes on a long journey as he tries unsuccessfully to learn how to live forever, learning about the Great Deluge on the way, but his remarkable building works guarantee that his fame will last long after his death.\n\nWith \n\nAndrew George\nProfessor of Babylonian at SOAS, University of London\n\nFrances Reynolds\nShillito Fellow in Assyriology at the Oriental Institute, University of Oxford and Fellow of St Benet's Hall\n\nand\n\nMartin Worthington\nLecturer in Assyriology at the University of Cambridge\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

Hardy's description of Tess as 'A Pure Woman' in 1892 incensed some Victorian readers. He resented having to censor some of his scenes in the early versions, including references to Tess's baby following her rape by Alec d'Urberville, and even to a scene where Angel Clare lifted four milkmaids over a flooded lane (substituting transportation by wheelbarrow).\n\nThe image above, from the 1891 edition, is captioned 'It Was Not Till About Three O'clock That Tess Raised Her Eyes And Gave A Momentary Glance Round. She Felt But Little Surprise At Seeing That Alec D'urberville Had Come Back, And Was Standing Under The Hedge By The Gate'.\n\nWith \n\nDinah Birch\nProfessor of English Literature and Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research and Impact at the University of Liverpool\n\nFrancis O'Gorman\nProfessor of Victorian Literature at the University of Leeds\n\nAnd\n\nJane Thomas\nReader in Victorian and early Twentieth Century literature at the University of Hull\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

The rhythms are generated within organisms and also in response to external stimuli, mainly light and darkness. They are found throughout the living world, from bacteria to plants, fungi to animals and, in humans, are noticed most clearly in sleep patterns. \n\nWith\n\nRussell Foster\nProfessor of Circadian Neuroscience at the University of Oxford\n\nDebra Skene\nProfessor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey\n\nAnd\n\nSteve Jones\nEmeritus Professor of Genetics at University College London."

Mali was the largest empire in west Africa and for almost 400 years controlled the flow of gold from mines in the south up to the Mediterranean coast and across to the Middle East. These gold mines were the richest known deposits in the 14th Century and produced around half of the world's gold. When Mansa Musa journeyed to Cairo in 1324 as part of his Hajj, he distributed so much gold that its value depreciated by over 10%. Some of the mosques he built on his return survive, albeit rebuilt, such as the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Great Mosque of Djenne. \n\nWith \n\nAmira Bennison\nReader in the History and Culture of the Maghrib at the University of Cambridge\n\nMarie Rodet\nSenior Lecturer in the History of Africa at SOAS\n\nAnd\n\nKevin MacDonald\nProfessor of African Archaeology\nChair of the African Studies Programme at University College, London \n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."

In the dark, they discovered hydrothermal vents, like chimneys, from which superheated water flowed. Around the vents there was an extraordinary variety of life, feeding on microbes which were thriving in the acidity and extreme temperature of the vents.
