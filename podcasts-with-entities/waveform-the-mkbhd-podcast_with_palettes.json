It's another long one this week, but we hope it's a fun one.\n\nVox survey:\nwww.vox.com/podsurvey\n\nShop the merch:\nhttps://shop.mkbhd.com\n\nShop products mentioned:\nNothing Earbuds (2022) at https://geni.us/bJuJ\niPad (2022) at https://geni.us/3yh7qpE\niPad Pro M2 (2022) at https://geni.us/f0jp\nApple Pencil (1st Gen) at https://geni.us/rSnjBq\nApple AirPods Pro 2 at https://geni.us/hSBNl6y\nApple AirPods (3rd Gen) at https://geni.us/2rPTBr\nBeats Fit Pro at https://geni.us/qVRe\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds II at https://geni.us/7nkpql6\nOnePlus Buds Pro at https://geni.us/Uy9FhO\n\nNews links:\nNothing Ear(1) price hike: https://bit.ly/nothingpricehike \nNew Nothing ear(stick): https://bit.ly/nothingearstick\n\nTwitters:\nWaveform: https://twitter.com/wvfrm\nMarques: https://twitter.com/mkbhd\nAustin Evans: https://twitter.com/austinnotduncan\nAndrew: https://twitter.com/andymanganelli\nDavid: https://twitter.com/durvidimel\nAdam: https://twitter.com/adamlukas17\nEllis: https://twitter.com/EllisRovin\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/wvfrmpodcast/\n\nJoin the Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/mkbhd\n\nMusic by 20syl:\nhttps://bit.ly/2S53xlC\n\nWaveform is part of the Vox Media Podcast Network.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

As soon as they got back they sat down with Andrew to talk about the event as a whole and first impressions on everything that was announced (right after talking about the fact that Marques can edit tweets). Then they discuss the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, the new Pixel Watch, and the Pixel Tablet which Andrew and David are super hyped about. Finally, we round it all up with some Google trivia. There's a lot to get through but it's a fun one!\n\nShop the merch:\nhttps://shop.mkbhd.com\n\nShop products mentioned:\nGoogle Pixel 7 at https://geni.us/mSSXkQf\nGoogle Pixel 7 Pro at https://geni.us/fQwcGw\nGoogle Pixel Watch w/ WiFi at https://geni.us/EHdG9KQ\nGoogle Pixel Watch w/ WiFi + LTE at https://geni.us/hXSRf0G\n\nTwitters:\nhttps://twitter.com/wvfrm\nhttps://twitter.com/mkbhd\nhttps://twitter.com/andymanganelli\nhttps://twitter.com/durvidimel\nhttps://twitter.com/adamlukas17\nhttps://twitter.com/EllisRovin\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/wvfrmpodcast/\n\nJoin the Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/mkbhd\n\nMusic by 20syl:\nhttps://bit.ly/2S53xlC\n\nWaveform is part of the Vox Media Podcast Network.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
