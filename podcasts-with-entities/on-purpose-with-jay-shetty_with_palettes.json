Rule #1 - Let Yourself Be Alone outlines a three-stage process for transitioning from loneliness to solitude, starting with being present with yourself and moving towards developing confidence in areas of personal growth.

Drew is a talented actress, producer, and director, known for her roles in films such as \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", \"Charlie's Angels\", and \"50 First Dates.\" She made her acting debut at the age of six in the film \"Altered States\" and rose to fame as a child star in the 1982 film \"E.T.\" She has since established herself as a leading lady in Hollywood and has also produced and directed several films. In addition to her successful career in the entertainment industry, she is also an author and a businesswoman, with her own production company and a cosmetics line. Currently, she hosts the The Drew Barrymore Show, which debuted in 2020 and has been renewed for a fourth season this year.  \r\n\r\nDrew shares her thoughts on being more empathetic, which means putting ourselves in others' shoes and treating them with kindness and compassion, why learning self-forgiveness is crucial for personal growth and healing, liberating or freeing yourself from mental, physical, or emotional constraints and can be achieved through self-awareness, self-care, and self-love. Prioritizing ourselves means taking care of our physical and mental well-being, setting boundaries, and making time for our own needs and wants. \r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that we cannot pour from an empty cup, and taking care of ourselves allows us to show up fully for others."

Her commitment to transforming the lives of people who suffer with emotional and mental health issues, and helping them to fulfill their potential, has seen her become a well-known figure in the wellness world.

Having one makes us value our self worth so much more and will help encourage others to treat us with respect.\r\n\r\nI start by talking about the consequences of breaking our boundaries, especially with the boundaries we had for our old self, how we should start becoming aware of them and build up new ones, and then start sharing these boundaries to our partner to let them understand where we stand. We also have the five types of boundaries we should start practicing."

He is the founder of Mindvalley, an education technology company building a new model for human education that aims to give everyone the same quality of life. Mindvalley creates tech and platforms that power online academies in areas that traditional education ignores. These include mindfulness, personal growth, wellness, spirituality and more. His quest is to help move humanity to a more holistic, integrated education system that caters for the whole being.   \r\n\r\nVishen, joining us again for another soulful conversation, strongly believes that compassion is what gives us real and genuine happiness. As he explains why compassion is the foundation to achieving all things positive in our life, how self compassion reinforces self love which leads to self care, and the disciplines we must practice so we can attain genuine happiness. We also dive into the definition of sadness, changing our perspective to turn sadness into love and compassion, and the importance of having a vision of the future, of having a clear idea of the path you want to make and take.\r\n\r\nNo matter how far and long our life goals may be, self compassion and being compassionate towards others will eventually lead to having a peaceful, content, and well-meaning life."

Alex is the creator, host, and executive producer of the hugely successful podcast and brand Call Her Daddy, which amasses millions of listeners per episode and frequently tops Podcast charts. In 2018, Alex began to blaze a path through the podcasting medium that had never before existed: a space where women were encouraged, empowered, and emboldened to share their unapologetic stories and truths. Now one of the most listened to female podcasters in the world, Alex continues to break all boundaries by shattering stigmas and stomping on misogyny, all while keeping mental health and personal empowerment at the forefront. Her thought-provoking conversations are meticulously designed to explore wide-ranging topics such as life experiences, culture, health, relationships, and more, all through her lens of comedy and extreme candor. To the millions of devoted gen-z and millennial listeners (\u201cThe Daddy Gang\u201d) the Call Her Daddy brand represents a new set of values and standards, with many quotes and phrases permeating pop-culture vernacular. In addition, the Boston-bred entrepreneur has a successful merchandise line, as well as several exciting business endeavors in the pipeline.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Alex bravely shares how she suffered through constant bullying in her younger years and the trauma she still carries because of it, the pain of feeling uncomfortable with your body, and how creating content has helped her find calmness, peace, and purpose. We talk about how gender equality remains a delicate subject, how women can help other women through various programs and campaigns, and how self respect is one of the things we owe to ourselves.\u00a0 We also discuss how social media can heavily influence our thoughts and actions, how to set boundaries with it and for yourself, and why finding the right partner plays a big role in our success.</p><p>Throughout the conversation, we learn that despite the many challenges we\u2019ve faced and will face in the future, there\u2019s no other way but to keep moving forward. Having the will to do so will help mold us to become a better version of ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>What We Discuss:</p><ul><li>00:00:00 Intro</li><li>00:04:56 What was your favorite thing about Italy?</li><li>00:06:33 \u201cI turned to making content as an escape.\u201d</li><li>00:18:01 We all go through similar experiences</li><li>00:20:07 \u201cI\u2019m the same person\u2026\u201d</li><li>00:25:54 The trauma of being bullied</li><li>00:32:04 We are not equal to men?</li><li>00:38:18 You can be mindful and determined</li><li>00:43:32 What is your relationship with respect?</li><li>00:55:20 Taking the show to a different level</li><li>01:00:23 It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t know things</li><li>01:05:46 Dealing with hate comments</li><li>01:12:34 When people assume you\u2019re a bad friend</li><li>01:23:54 Respecting the privacy of your partner</li><li>01:30:55 What are you looking for in a partner?</li><li>01:36:45 The Many Sides Of You</li><li>01:42:25 Alex on Fast Five</li></ul><p>Episode Resources</p><ul><li>Alex Cooper | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alexandracooper/\">Instagram</a></li><li>Alex Cooper | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexandracooper\">Twitter</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.callherdaddy.com/\">Call Her Daddy</a></li></ul><p>Do you want to meditate daily with me?

Alex is the creator, host, and executive producer of the hugely successful podcast and brand Call Her Daddy, which amasses millions of listeners per episode and frequently tops Podcast charts. In 2018, Alex began to blaze a path through the podcasting medium that had never before existed: a space where women were encouraged, empowered, and emboldened to share their unapologetic stories and truths. Now one of the most listened to female podcasters in the world, Alex continues to break all boundaries by shattering stigmas and stomping on misogyny, all while keeping mental health and personal empowerment at the forefront. Her thought-provoking conversations are meticulously designed to explore wide-ranging topics such as life experiences, culture, health, relationships, and more, all through her lens of comedy and extreme candor. To the millions of devoted gen-z and millennial listeners (\u201cThe Daddy Gang\u201d) the Call Her Daddy brand represents a new set of values and standards, with many quotes and phrases permeating pop-culture vernacular. In addition, the Boston-bred entrepreneur has a successful merchandise line, as well as several exciting business endeavors in the pipeline.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Alex bravely shares how she suffered through constant bullying in her younger years and the trauma she still carries because of it, the pain of feeling uncomfortable with your body, and how creating content has helped her find calmness, peace, and purpose. We talk about how gender equality remains a delicate subject, how women can help other women through various programs and campaigns, and how self respect is one of the things we owe to ourselves.\u00a0 We also discuss how social media can heavily influence our thoughts and actions, how to set boundaries with it and for yourself, and why finding the right partner plays a big role in our success.</p><p>Throughout the conversation, we learn that despite the many challenges we\u2019ve faced and will face in the future, there\u2019s no other way but to keep moving forward.

                "summary": "Today, I sit down with Meghan Trainor, an award-winning singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist that has garnered a GRAMMY for Best New Artist, achieved eight multi-platinum singles and two platinum albums, sold out three world tours, penned multi-platinum hits for peers across pop and country, received countless industry awards and nominations, and has recently started her own podcast with her brother Ryan Trainor entitled Workin\u2019 On It, while also becoming a TikTok star. She has just released her new single \u201cBad For Me,\u201d featuring Teddy Swims, and has announced her fourth full-length album, Takin\u2019 It Back, arriving October 21st, 2022, via Epic Records.\r\n\r\nMeghan shares what her childhood was like growing up on a small community island, her passion for song writing and how having supportive parents helped her get recognition for her talent and eventually led to releasing her debut song, All About That Bass. We talk about how being authentic and just showing up as yourself online and in real life will make people appreciate you more, why appreciating the body you have is the best way to love yourself, the crippling panic attacks that were overcome by asking for help and working with the right people, and how she has found love with a man who accepted her flaws and sees her true value. \r\n\r\nMeghan shows us how our life may be built within a bubble and still find the courage to dream big, break free from any limitations, and find success in doing things we are passionate about."

                "summary": "Jay Shetty sits down with Water.Org co-founders Matt Damon and Gary White to talk about the water crisis around the world. We see stories of extreme poverty in places that are less developed and have little to no access to basic services such as electricity and water. These stories of struggles are out there but we don\u2019t get to hear the rawness of the situation and reality many people live in. The water crisis is real and it\u2019s one of the major hindrances for children to have proper education and a chance at a better future. \r\n\r\nWhile everyone knows Matt Damon as an actor and producer and screenwriter, in 2006, he founded H20 Africa Foundation to raise awareness about water initiatives on the continent. Matt's active participation in the work of Water.Org and Walter Equity has positioned him as one of the world's experts on water and sanitation issues. Now in 1991, Gary White launched Water Partners, now the international NGO known as Water.Org. Today, he leads two organizations in creating and executing market-driven solutions to the global water crisis driving innovations in the way water and sanitation projects are delivered and financed."

There is a huge difference between success and happiness, oftentimes we confuse the two as one and the same. One can be successful in their job, career, business, and family life, but can be unhappy.

We build up walls to block the wrong people from ever coming into our lives and putting us through difficult moments and heartbreaking experiences. We lose confidence in others because of our past relationships and in doing so, we may never be ready to open up again for a new relationship. \r\n\r\nIn this episode of On Purpose, Jay Shetty shares with us the signs that will tell us when we are ready to love again and when it's okay to entrust our feelings to someone new."

It started with what was then considered a wild idea from two 22-year olds and has ended with a brand that has been revolutionized with technology for maximum comfort and performance.

Trust issues, as they build up, lead to arguments, disagreements, and discontent, and eventually that intimacy and connection you have with your partner is lost.\r\n\r\nDoubts then overtake and plague the mind and the heart. And when we are driven by doubts, we lose trust, we lose love, and sadly, we eventually lose the relationship we fought so hard to keep. \r\n\r\nIn this episode of On Purpose, Jay Shetty lists down the different kinds of doubts that affect most relationships and how we can turn these around to save our relationship."

It\u2019s not easy to process negative emotions with positive thoughts.</li><li>Jay is curious about how Will continues to achieve success with a loving heart.

                "summary": "Will Smith (@willsmith) is an actor, producer and musician, two-time Academy Award nominee, Grammy Award and NAACP award winner who has enjoyed a diverse career encompassing films, television and multi platinum records. Starting as a rapper in 1985, Smith is best known for his acting roles in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I Am Legend, the Bad Boys and Men in Black film series, Aladdin and Hitch. His vast filmography also includes transformative portrayals of true-life icons in Ali, The Pursuit of Happyness and Concussion.\r\n\r\nToday, Will Smith sits down with Jay Shetty to talk about his commitment to family, straying away from his father\u2019s military mindset in search of true happiness, and how to live the golden rule - to treat others how you want to be treated.\r\n\r\nJay Shetty\u2019s Conversation With Will Smith:\r\nToday, Jay Shetty welcomes his dear friend, Will Smith as they reminisce about the happy times and adventures they spent together, and how their friendship flourished as Will studies the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.\r\nJay asks Will: \u201cTell us a bit about what you learned from your parents and how you were able to process it positively? It\u2019s not easy to process negative emotions with positive thoughts.\u00a0\r\nJay is curious about how Will continues to achieve success with a loving heart. It\u2019s never easy to live with a military mindset yet even with success and fame it didn\u2019t feel like true happiness.\r\nJay asks listeners to put their minds in the middle path while Will suggests learning from an athlete\u2019s mindset and level of discipline to manifest the things that they want in their life.\u00a0\r\nJay mentions how Will\u2019s grandmother had a huge impact in his life. It's all about finding peace by living your life in service. His parents, on the other hand, had different principles and pushed for totally different things, yet they showed him how life should be lived.\u00a0\r\nJay talks about the hard work Will had to do that people don\u2019t really see. A lot of people have not seen the learning accumulated through hard work, the sacrifices made along the way, and the military mindset that Will cradled so deeply within.\r\nJay points out that most superheroes get their powers when bad things happen to them. This is also true for everyone, that most of our experiences happen to teach us a lesson. Will then added that there is no such thing as a bad experience.\r\nJay taps into Will\u2019s last moments with his father and how he coped with the loss. The lesson learned from the experience is to always be genuine with your every \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cGoodbye\u201d, who knows it could be the last.\r\nJay asks Will about how the tradition to learn new religion every year, how this strengthened his bond with Jada, and the lessons learned while studying these different religions.\r\nJay talks to Will about the wisdom within books, how past people had lived through the same problems that most of us are dealing with today. Treating people the way you want to be treated is essential in maintaining peaceful relationships around you.\r\nJay explains the Analogy of the Mirror wherein people become so disconnected from nature that everything becomes instant and our mindset has become NOW whereas nature is never instant.\u00a0\r\nJay shares the first time he communicated with Will. It surprised him how Will can be so committed to the things he sets his mind on. And that prompted Jay to relearn and fall back in love with the things he fell in love years ago. Commitment is changing yourself through constant practice.\r\nWill explains why the central focus of his life is having a successful love relationship. This determination came after his experience with his parents divorce. He continues to seek knowledge on achieving this goal.\u00a0\r\nWill discusses why the concepts of ignorance and delusion are always the center of problems in every human relationship. All issues within human relations stem from a lack of understanding.\r\nWill retells his unforgettable encounter with Nelson Mandela and how he was offered to be his student about life struggles.\u00a0\r\nJay is curious why Will is so moved by the Story of Arjun. Will eagerly explains the story and why it resonated with so much.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nJay explains that most of us are living our life based on the result of our actions, which we think is a sign of success. We shouldn\u2019t be living a life based on the possible results of our actions, instead we should live for ourselves and our own happiness.\r\nJay and Will agree on this: It's not a problem if you have comprehension of what's happening around you. You don't call things problems that you have complete comprehension of.\r\nWill relives his character as The Genie, a character so similar to his personality, his core. The concept of the sacred clown, the singing, dancing, and joy it brings, is beautiful conduit for the ideas.\u00a0\r\nWill Smith ON the Fast Five questions\r\n\r\nLike this show?

He began to rediscover what it meant to be uniquely him.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOn this episode of On Purpose, Best Selling Author and Ultra-Athlete Rich Roll and Jay talk about navigating self destructive practices, gaining wisdom from those closest to you, and pursuing work and activities that make you feel the most uniquely you.

He debunks quick fixes that provide temporary relief and goes over specific habits we can all implement in our daily lives in order to improve our mood and actually make it last.\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
