After a chance encounter she landed upon her goal - she was going to set off on one of the largest adventures imaginable: a walk around the world. She didn't know exactly how the journey would play out, but that was part of the appeal - the whole planet was waiting for her to just take the first step.  \n\nIn this episode, Matthew Syed hears from Angela about her 6 year walk around the world, from the misery of freezing cold nights, to finding beauty in solitary nights sleeping under the stars. And Angela explores her ideas about courage - after she was raped during her expedition, she chose to continue her journey around the world. Over the six years she walked, she would find deep connection to herself and to others, making lifelong friends and sinking into the places, slowly, just placing one foot in front of the other.\n\nWe hear from Susan Houge Mackenzie, a professor of psychology at the University of Otago, about the benefits of adventure to our mindset, even 'micro adventures' which take place much nearer to home, and from naturalist and conservationist Nadia Shaikh, who is a land justice activist working with the Right to Roam campaign, who makes a case that we need far greater access to nature to be able to undertake micro adventures in our local area. \n\nMatthew considers how adventures big and small can clarify our goals for our lives, and asks us to consider whether we ought to all be heading out on adventures a little more often.\n\nIf you have been affected by sexual abuse or violence, details of help and support are available at bbc.co.uk/actionline\n\nPresenter: Matthew Syed\nProducer: Nadia Mehdi\nSeries Editor: Katherine Godfrey\nSound design and mix: Rob Speight\nTheme tune by Ioana Selaru.\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4",

As the series draws to a close, Matthew explores the changing nature of Chinese sporting diplomacy and how sport, and table tennis, are still deeply entwined with the country\u2019s wider ambitions. \n\nPresented by Matthew Syed\nProducer: Pippa Smith\nSeries Editor: Katherine Godfrey\nScript consultation: Dr Olivia Cheung, SOAS, University of London\nSound Design and mix: Rob Speight\nArchival research: Nadia Mehdi\nWith thanks to Zhijie Shao from the BBC World Service and to the International Table Tennis Federation\n\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4"

And the world wakes up to the devastating fallout of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn this new mini series from Sideways, writer and Times columnist Matthew Syed is calling for a nuclear awakening. Since the end of the Cold War, when relations between two of the world\u2019s nuclear superpowers - the former USSR and the USA - seemed more rosy, Matthew argues that many of us have slipped into a kind of comfortable amnesia about the presence of these destroyers of worlds. \n\nThe wake up call came when President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in February accompanied by veiled nuclear threats.  It was a reminder of the mind bending fact that there are weapons in existence that are capable of eradicating our species. \n\nOver four episodes, Matthew explores the intellectual and strategic frameworks birthed by the bomb and the tensions of the Cold War, which sought to contain the ultimate destructive force. From deterrence to disarmament and non-proliferation, these ideas all aim at one goal - protection from catastrophic nuclear use.

Stopping a moment to take a look, Bill beheld a sight that would change the course of his life. At the wheel was a ceramics teacher, Mr Frank Ross, spinning a lump of clay into a beautiful bowl. He was witnessing a profound metaphor - he could make his life into something beautiful as Mr Ross made bowls from clay. \n\nMr Ross had lit a fuse within Bill. He went onto university and eventually set up the Manchester Craftsmen\u2019s Guild, an afterschool arts programme in his neighbourhood of North Side, Pittsburgh. The programme is designed to intercept the often difficult lives of teenagers in the area, to put them on a path toward a positive future with the help of inspirational teachers. \n\nAnd it works. Thousands of kids come through the programme each year and Bill\u2019s work has been recognised by the White House, among others. \n\nMatthew Syed explores how teachers have the power to transform the world, one student at a time. It\u2019s a big responsibility taken seriously by the likes of history teacher Shalina Patel.

Using incredible skill and the best in modern equipment he re-attaches the arteries, but the veins are proving difficult. Blood keeps getting congested and the little ear is turning black. Just when it looks like all is lost, Joe remembers leeches.\n\nOnce used to treat every malady imaginable, the vampiric worms fell out of favour when we gained a better understanding of how the body works. But, Matthew Syed wonders, did the medical backlash against leeches go too far, squandering the ancient wisdom contained in the worm? \n\nIn seeking to find out what other potentially useful cures have been consigned to history, Matthew learns about an Anglo Saxon recipe for an eye balm which uses garlic and bovine bile and may have MRSA busting qualities.

Arlene says that her experience leading expeditions has helped her acquire the personal skills and attributes required to push through bold new science policies. \n\nMatthew Syed asks whether transferable resilience from one field to another is the secret to reaching the top not just once, but throughout our lives.\n\nArlene is not alone in her experience. Riteesh Mishra, a retired pro-footballer turned coach and talent manager, is a big advocate for \u201cdual careers\". Likewise, Professor Julia Richardson has led a study looking into how sportspeople can adapt their skills to second careers, drawing on their experiences in one area in order to excel in another. \n\nLiving a dual life as a mountaineer and a chemist has equipped Arlene with resilience and determination, but there\u2019s something else that\u2019s led Arlene to the top, and that\u2019s the ability to question the ways things have always been done. Professor Steven Nadler, a philosopher specialising in early modern philosophy, says that Arlene can be considered a modern heretic. Do we need a bit more heretical thinking to get to the top of our own mountains?\n\nPresenter: Matthew Syed\nProducer: Claire Crofton\nSeries Editor: Katherine Godfrey\nResearcher: Nadia Mehdi\nMusic, Sound Design and Mix: Nicholas Alexander\nTheme Music: Seventy Times Seven by Ioana Selaru\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4"

His new book lies ready to be pulped.\n\nIn the first of a new series of Sideways, Matthew Syed asks why we\u2019re doomed to be unoriginal and why it hurts so much to be, well, not that special.\n\nIn 1998, Hollywood directors Matthew Bay and Mimi Leder went head to head with suspiciously similar disaster movies -  Armageddon and Deep Impact. Allegations of late-night spying flew around. But could there have just been something in the air? Matthew reveals that, four years earlier, fragments of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 Comet smashed into Jupiter and right into the American consciousness.\n\nThis is the thing... As Matthew discovers, our brains are wired for unoriginality, we evolve as a collective brain, absorbing our shared cultural cues and looking for what has worked in the past. But if that\u2019s the norm, why do we feel so disappointed when our ideas seem unoriginal, when someone else beats us to it? And is there a way out of this - to rekindle our originality?\n\nWith author Ian Leslie, Kristen Lopez, TV editor for Indiewire and pop culture critic, Dr Michael Muthukrishna, Associate Professor of Economic Psychology at the London School of Economics and Nick Groom, Professor of Literature in English, University of Macau.\n\nPresenter: Matthew Syed\nProducer/Series Editor: Katherine Godfrey\nExecutive Producer: Max O'Brien\nMusic, Sound Design and Mix: Nicholas Alexander\nResearch and Development: Gavin Haynes and Madeleine Parr\nTheme Music: Seventy Times Seven by Ioana Selaru\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4",

Matthew reveals that, four years earlier, fragments of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 Comet smashed into Jupiter and right into the American consciousness.\n\nThis is the thing... As Matthew discovers, our brains are wired for unoriginality, we evolve as a collective brain, absorbing our shared cultural cues and looking for what has worked in the past. But if that\u2019s the norm, why do we feel so disappointed when our ideas seem unoriginal, when someone else beats us to it? And is there a way out of this - to rekindle our originality?\n\nWith author Ian Leslie, Kristen Lopez, TV editor for Indiewire and pop culture critic, Dr Michael Muthukrishna, Associate Professor of Economic Psychology at the London School of Economics and Nick Groom, Professor of Literature in English, University of Macau.\n\nPresenter: Matthew Syed\nProducer/Series Editor: Katherine Godfrey\nExecutive Producer: Max O'Brien\nMusic, Sound Design and Mix: Nicholas Alexander\nResearch and Development: Gavin Haynes and Madeleine Parr\nTheme Music: Seventy Times Seven by Ioana Selaru\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4",
