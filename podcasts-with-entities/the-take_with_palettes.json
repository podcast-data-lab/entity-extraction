So, what is the Navy doing to clean the water, and what is at risk for the more than 900,000 people living on the island?\r\n\r\nIn this episode:\u00a0\r\nScott Kim, News Editor at Hawaii Public Radio (@wearehpr)\r\nWayne Tanaka, Sierra Club Chapter Director (@sierraclubhi)\r\n\r\nConnect with The Take:\u00a0\r\n\r\nTwitter (@AJTheTake), Instagram (@ajthetake) and Facebook (@TheTakePod)"

Many thought the family\u2019s hold over Libya was done, but one of Gaddafi\u2019s sons is trying to overcome his past \u2013 and his ICC charges \u2013 to maneuver for power. He could even be a contender in December\u2019s upcoming elections. So what are the chances that Libya could see the rise of another Gaddafi?\r\n\r\nIn this episode:\u00a0\r\nMalik Traina (@libyanmind),\u00a0 Al Jazeera producer in Libya\u00a0\r\nTarek Megerisi (@tmegrisi), Senior Policy Fellow, European Council on Foreign Relations\u00a0\r\n\r\nConnect with The Take:\u00a0\r\n\r\nTwitter (@AJTheTake), Instagram (@ajthetake) and Facebook (@TheTakePod)"

It\u2019s part of a Pan-African campaign to encourage repatriation and investment in tourism in Africa, and it\u2019s a trend that culminated in 2019 with Ghana\u2019s Year of Return, which marked 400 years since the first enslaved people from Africa were brought to the Americas. We speak to two women about their decision to leave the US and the UK to move to Ghana and The Gambia for good.\r\n\r\nIn this episode:\r\n\r\nMuhammida El Muhajir, Ghana resident since 2014;  Juliet Ryan, co-founder of the Council of African Descendants in The Gambia, and host of Bla Xit on YouTube.\r\n\r\nConnect with The Take:\u00a0\r\n\r\nTwitter (@AJTheTake), Instagram (@ajthetake) and Facebook (@TheTakePod)"

At the center of it all are the many cases that had gone largely unnoticed. Al Jazeera's award-winning documentary show Faultlines got in touch with one woman whose son, Marqueese Alston, was killed by Washington, D.C. police in 2018. Activists say her fight for justice shows exactly why police reforms don't work \u2014 and why abolition would.\r\n\r\nIn this episode: \r\n\r\nKavitha Chekuru (@KaviChek), a senior producer on Al Jazeera's award-winning documentary show Faultlines; Alex Vitale (@avitale), author of The End of Policing. \r\n\r\nYou can watch the Faultlines documentary on Marqueese Alston's killing and the ongoing protest movement at aje.io/PoliceProtests.\r\n\r\nConnect with The Take:\u00a0\r\n\r\nTwitter (@ajthetake), Instagram (@ajthetake) and Facebook (@TheTakePod)."
