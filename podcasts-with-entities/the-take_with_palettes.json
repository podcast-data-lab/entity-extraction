Journalist Niloofar Hamedi captured the moment in a photo and tweeted it out. Within the week, she was arrested. A week later, journalist Elahe Mohammadi was also arrested after reporting from Amini\u2019s funeral. Iran erupted in protests after Amini\u2019s death, and demonstrators were met with a swift crackdown. Thousands of people were detained, including Hamedi and Mohammadi, who remain imprisoned to this day. On May 29 and 30, their trials finally began behind closed doors.
