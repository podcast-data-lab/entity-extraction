And those sudden superpowers can be a boon when you\u2019re running from a lion. But repeatedly dipping into that well can make you sick, even kill you.

                "summary": "<p>Fantasy writer Elsa Sjunneson has been haunted by Helen Keller for nearly her entire life. Like Helen, Elsa is Deafblind, and growing up she was constantly compared to her. But for a million different reasons she hated that, because she felt different from her in a million different ways. Then, a year ago, an online conspiracy theory claiming Helen was a fraud exploded on TikTok, and suddenly Elsa found herself drawing her sword and jumping to Helen\u2019s defense, setting off a chain of events that would bring her closer to the disability icon than she ever dreamt. For over a year, Elsa, Lulu and the Radiolab team dug through primary sources, talked to experts, even visited Helen\u2019s birthplace Ivy Green, and discovered the real story of Helen Keller is far more complicated, mysterious and confounding than the simple myth of a young Deafblind girl rescued by her teacher Annie Sullivan. It\u2019s a story of ghosts, surprises, a few tears, a bit of romance, some hard conversations, and a possibly psychic dog.<em>This episode was reported by Elsa Sjunneson and Lulu Miller. It was produced by Sindhu Gnanasambandan and Rachel Cusick, with help from Sarah Qari, Tanya Chawla, and Carolyn McClusker. </em><em>Jeremy Bloom contributed music and sound design. Additional Mixing by Arianne Wack.</em></p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to\u00a0Georgina Kleege, Julia Bascom, Desiree Kocis, Peter C.

It\u2019s the chaos of life.</p>\n<p>Latif, Lulu, and our Senior Producer Matt Kielty were all sitting on their own little stories until they got thrown into the studio, and had their cherished beliefs about the shape of life put on a collision course. From an accidental study of sea creatures, to the ambitions of Stephen J Gould, to an undercooked theory that captured the world\u2019s imagination, we undo the seeming order of the living world and try to make some music out of the wreckage. (Bonus: Learn how Francis Crick really thought life got started on this planet).</p>\n<p><em>This episode was reported by Latif Nasser, Matt Kielty, Heather Radke, Lulu Miller and Candice Wang. It was produced by Matt Kielty and Simon Adler. Sound and music from Matt Kielty, Simon Adler, and Jeremy Bloom, and dialogue mix by Arianne Wack.Special thanks to Alan and Alida Goffinski\u00a0for giving our chaos musical life in the song at the end of the episode.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaum_fMDGgFQCmKHUBPq_xg\">Radiolab is on YouTube!</a> Catch up with new episodes and hear classics from our archive.

Most autoimmune disorders do. And not just by a little bit, often by a lot; in some cases, as much as sixteen times more. But why? On today\u2019s episode, we talk to scientists trying to answer that question. We go back 100 million years, to when our placenta first evolved and consider how it might have shaped our immune system. We dive deep into the genome, to stare at one of the most famous chromosomes: the X. And we also try to unravel a mystery \u2014 why is it that for some females, autoimmune disorders seemingly disappear during pregnancy?</p>\n<p><em>This episode was reported by Molly Webster, and produced by Sindhu </em><em>Gnanasambandan and Molly Webster</em><em>.</em> <em>The Gonads theme song was written, performed, and produced by Majel Connery and Alex Overington.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Looking for something else to listen to?

She told the judge, \"I was told right now in the conservatorship, I'm not able to get married or have a baby.\" Today, we look back at an old episode\u00a0where we explore why it is that hundreds of thousands of people can have their reproductive rights denied...and\u00a0spoiler: it goes back to Darwin.</p>\n<p>When a law student named Mark Bold came across a Supreme Court decision from the 1920s that allowed for the forced sterilization of people deemed \u201cunfit,\u201d he was shocked to discover that it had never been overturned. His law professors told him the case, Buck v Bell, was nothing to worry about, that the ruling was in a kind of legal limbo and could never be used against people. But he didn\u2019t buy it. In this episode we follow Mark on a journey to one of the darkest consequences of humanity\u2019s attempts to measure the human mind and put people in boxes, following him through history, science fiction and a version of eugenics that\u2019s still very much alive today, and watch as he crusades to restore a dash of moral order to the universe.</p>\n<p><em>This episode was produced by Matt Kielty, Lulu Miller and Pat Walters.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Sara Luterman, Lynn Rainville, Alex Minna Stern, Steve Silberman and Lydia X.Z.

Security Moms. Nascar Dads. Joe Six Pack. Walmart Moms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But what about everyone else? What about the surprisingly swingable corners of this country without a soccer mom in sight?\u00a0 Inspired by this <a href=\"https://www.thinglink.com/scene/810170295397646337?buttonSource=viewLimits\">exceedingly cool interactive map</a> from Politico, we set out on a mission to make an audio-map of our own. We asked pollsters, reporters and political operatives in swing states: what slice of your population is up for grabs? A slice that no one talks about? In this episode, we crawl inside the places that might hold our country\u2019s future in its hands, all the while asking: are these slices even real? Are there people inside them that might swing this election?\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>This episode was reported and produced by Becca Bressler, Tobin Low, Sarah Qari, Tracie Hunte, Pat Walters and Matt Kielty, with help from Jonny Moens.</em></p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Darren Samuelsohn, Josh Cochran, Elizabeth Ralph, and the Politico team for the original reporting and map that inspired this episode.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Also thanks to: Elissa Schneider, Wisam Naoum, Martin Manna, Ashourina Slewo, Eli Newman, Zoe Clark, Erin Roselio, Jess Kamm Broomell, Will Doran, John Zogby, Matt Dickinson, Tom Jensen, Ross Grogg, Joel Andrus, Jonathan Tilove, Steve Contorno, Heaven Hale,\u00a0Jeff Shapiro, Nicole Cobler, Marie Albiges, Matt Dole, Robin Goist, Katie Paris, Julie Womack, Matt Dole, Jackie Borchardt, Jessica Locklear, Twinkle Patel, Bobby Das, Dharmesh Ahir,\u00a0 Nimesh Dhinubhai, Jay Desai, Rishi Bagga, and\u00a0</em><em>Sanjeev Joshipura.</em></p>\n<p><em>Christina Greer\u2019s book is </em><a href=\"https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199989300.001.0001/acprof-9780199989300\"><em>Black Ethnics: Race, Immigration, and the Pursuit of the American Dream</em></a><em>, and Corey Fields book is </em><a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520291904/black-elephants-in-the-room\"><em>Black Elephants in the Room: The Unexpected Politics of African American</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Original art for this episode by Zara Stasi.

Last summer, Rosa Brooks got together a team of experts and political operatives from both sides of the aisle to ask a slightly different question. Rather than arguing about whether he\u2019d do those things, they dug into what exactly would happen if he did. Part war game part choose your own adventure, Rosa\u2019s Transition Integrity Project doesn\u2019t give us any predictions, and it isn\u2019t a referendum on Trump. Instead, it\u2019s a deeply illuminating stress test on our laws, our institutions, and on the commitment to democracy written into the constitution.</p>\n<p><em>This episode was reported by Bethel Habte, with help from Tracie Hunte, and produced by Bethel Habte.

And it\u2019s a live game show, judged by Jad, Robert \u2026 and a dog.</p>\n<p>For the last episode of G, Radiolab\u2019s miniseries on intelligence, we\u2019re sharing that game show with you. It was recorded as a live show back in May 2019 at the Greene Space in New York City. We invited two science writers, Dan Engber and Laurel Braitman, and two comedians, Tracy Clayton and Jordan Mendoza, to compete against one another to find the world\u2019s smartest animal. What resulted were a series of funny, delightful stories about unexpectedly smart animals and a shift in the way we think about intelligence across all the animals - including us.</p>\n<p>Check out the video of our live event <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thegreenespace/videos/whats-the-smartest-animal-in-the-world-radiolab-is-live-from-the-greene-space-at/1680681042075725/\">here</a>!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>This episode was produced by Rachael Cusick and Pat Walters, with help from Nora Keller and Suzie Lechtenberg.

With the help of reporter Lee Romney, we investigate how that lawsuit came to be, where IQ tests came from, and what happened to one little boy who got caught in the crossfire.</p>\n<p><em>This episode was reported and produced by Lee Romney, Rachael Cusick and Pat Walters.</em></p>\n<p><em>Music by Alex Overington.\u00a0</em><em>Fact-checking by Diane Kelly.</em></p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Elie Mistal, Chenjerai Kumanyika, Amanda Stern, Nora Lyons, Ki Sung, Public Advocates, Michelle Wilson, Peter Fernandez, John Schaefer.

Plus mind-bending musical accompaniment from Laguardia Arts High School singers Nathaniel Sabat, Julian Soto, Eli Greenhoe, Kelly Efthimiu, Julia Egan, and Ruby Froom.\n\r\nYou can find the video Christine Campbell made of her mom Mary Sue here.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport Radiolab today at\u00a0Radiolab.org/donate.",

In this short, a king's deal with God leads to an intricate mechanical creation, and Jad heads to the Smithsonian to investigate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the 17-year-old crown prince of Spain, Don Carlos, fell down a set of stairs in 1562, he threw his whole country into a state of uncertainty about the future. Especially his father, King Philip II, who despite being the most powerful man in the world, was helpless in the face of his heir's terrible head wound. When none of the leading remedies of the day--bleeding, blistering, purging, or drilling--helped, the king enlisted the help of a relic...the corpse of a local holy man who had died 100 years earlier. Then, Philip II promised that if God saved his son, he'd repay him with a miracle of his own.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://arts.vcu.edu/sculpture/portfolios/elizabeth-king/\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth King</a>, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, describes how--according to legend--Philip II held up his end of the bargain with the help of a renowned clockmaker and an intricate invention.
