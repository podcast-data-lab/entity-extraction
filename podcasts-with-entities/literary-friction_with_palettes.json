Each show features an author interview, book recommendations, lively discussion and a little music too, all built around a related theme - anything from the novella to race to masculinity.

Is it simply a marketing term or has it become problematic trope in publishing? Have we moved on from book covers with women face down in cakes on them? Plus all the usual recommendations."

Here in the UK right now there\u2019s a serious cost of living crisis after years of terrible Conservative rule, the newspapers are full of often extremely patronising articles about how to \u2018tighten your belt\u2019, and it feels like everyone is talking about money without necessarily really talking about money. Are all books to some extent about money? Does the novel offer a useful way into thinking and talking about it? And where does the myth of The Writer who can afford to live off their writing alone come into it? Listen in as we dig into this, plus all the usual recommendations. Enjoy!"

With the aim of bringing seminal titles to a new generation of readers, the Picador Collection combines the gravitas of a modern classics list with the eccentric, boundary-pushing spirit of cult paperback publishing. To celebrate the collection, we interviewed the inimitable Antiguan-American writer Jamaica Kincaid, who has five books featured on this list. Then we talked to Stu Wilson, from the art department at Picador. The Picador Collection titles all have a fresh new look, designed by Katie Tooke, and Stu will be telling us about the work that went into designing the series, and the fascinating process of cover design more generally.\n\nWe are ALSO running a competition with Picador! 5 lucky listeners will win a sturdy and now very rare Literary Friction tote, along with each of our two favourite titles from the Picador Collection, plus one of Jamaica\u2019s books, which means five books in total - if you want to find who chose what (and see if you can guess\u2026) check out both of our socials: @picadorbooks and @litfriction on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nThe competition is now LIVE and will be open until the 6th of October, so you have a two week window to enter!

Argentine writer and novelist Pola Oloixarac joined us from Barcelona to talk about her latest novel Mona, which has been translated from Spanish by Adam Morris. It's the story of a young Peruvian novelist invited to Sweden, where she's in the running for one of the most prestigious literary awards in Europe. There, she has a number of hilarious run-ins with authors from all over the world, but lurking beneath the surface is a memory of violence which \ncannot be fully suppressed. It's a biting and very funny satire of the literary world, so in honour of Mona this show is all about our favourite satirical work, from The Master and the Margarita to Catch 22. We'll get into what we think makes satire successful, and also some of the times it can fall flat, plus all the usual recommendations. Enjoy! \n\nRecommendations on the theme, Satire:\nOctavia: The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov\nCarrie: Catch 22 by Joseph Heller\n\nGeneral Recommendations: \nOctavia: The Liars' Club by Mary Karr\nPola: Borges by Adolfo Bioy Casares, translated by Valerie Miles (NY Review of Books)\nCarrie: Both Ways is the Only Way I Want It by Maile Meloy\n\nFind a list of all recommended books at: https://uk.bookshop.org/lists/mar-2022-satire-with-pola-oloixarac\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/litfriction\n\nEmail us: litfriction@gmail.com\nTweet us & find us on Instagram: @litfriction \nThis episode is sponsored by Picador: https://www.panmacmillan.com/picador",

                "summary": "It's September, the leaves are starting to turn, and we're kicking off our Autumn season with a vital conversation about the power of writing for change. Our guest is the author Shon Faye, who joined us to discuss her hotly anticipated first book, The Transgender Issue: An Argument for Justice. It's a necessary and inspiring text in which she argues that we're having the wrong conversation about trans people, and that the struggle for trans liberation is all of our struggle. In honour of Shon's book, which aims to change the terms of a cultural conversation, we'll talk more widely about books that seek to shift perspectives, including the ones that shifted ours. It's good to be back! \n\nRecommendations on the theme, Writing for Change:\nOctavia: The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud\nCarrie: Ways of Seeing by John Berger\n\nGeneral Recommendations:\nOctavia: Paul by Daisy Lafarge \nShon: The Right to Sex by Amia Srinivasan\nCarrie: Circe by Madeline Miller\n\nFind a list of all recommended books at: https://uk.bookshop.org/shop/litfriction\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/litfriction \nEmail us: litfriction@gmail.com\nTweet us & find us on Instagram: @litfriction \n\nThis episode is sponsored by Picador: https://www.panmacmillan.com/picador"

It's a book about a lot of things - being a writer, being a woman, how we make and remake a life, and what we ultimately leave behind. But it's also about real estate, which got us thinking about the importance of buildings, houses and homes in literature. How can books help us understand where and how we make our homes? Why is the haunted house such an enduring symbol? And how is the value of property different for 'generation rent'? So if you want to check out some hot property, join us for all this plus the usual recommendations. \n\nRecommendations on the theme, Real Estate:\nOctavia: In The Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado\nCarrie: The Little Stranger by Sarah Waters\n\nGeneral Recommendations:\nOctavia: Detransition, Baby by Torrey Peters\nDeborah: The Friend by Sigrid Nunez\nCarrie: The Ice Palace by Tarjei Vesaas\n\nFind lists of all recommended books at: http://uk.bookshop.org/shop/litfriction, where you can order books online while supporting independent bookshops.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/litfriction\n\nEmail us: litfriction@gmail.com\nTweet us & find us on Instagram: @litfriction \n\nThis episode is sponsored by Picador: https://www.panmacmillan.com/picador",

The suggestion for this theme was sent to us on Patreon by a patron called Agnes - who asked if we\u2019d talk about how we relate to books as things, as well as vessels for thoughts and experiences. Tune in to find out who is a profligate page folder, who underlines in pen, and who once threw a library book in a puddle of mud (gasp!).

We spoke to Leone Ross about her sensuous, absorbing new novel, This One Sky Day, which is set in the fictional Carribean archipelago of Popisho, where everyone is born with a certain magical gift, or cors. It's a story about many things, but mainly of two lovers trying to find their way back to one another over the course of a single day while the world shifts around them. We spoke to Leone about the subversive potential of magical realism, it's political power, and why some people are still so snobby about it.

It\u2019s the story of her lost cat, Gattino, and also a clear-eyed and heartbreaking meditation on who we are allowed to love, how different kinds of suffering are connected, and the hope and pain that love can bring. Inspired by Gattino and Mary, the theme of today\u2019s show is \u2018Complicated Love\u2019, and we\u2019ll be looking at its joys and perils in books from Romeo and Juliet to Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit.

This month we\u2019re talking about luxury in literature - and no, we don\u2019t mean books about the 1% having spa days or flying first class. Instead, we\u2019re talking about writing that explores the aesthetic, opulent, baroque and decadent. Through writers including Oscar Wilde, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sylvia Plath, we\u2019ll be thinking about what makes writing luxurious, and why engaging with luxury can be a subversive act of resistance for marginalised communities. Our guest today is Shola von Reinhold, whose debut novel Lote is about present-day narrator Mathilda's fixation with the forgotten Black Scottish modernist poet, Hermia Druitt. It's also a beautiful meditation on aesthetics and beauty and who is allowed access to them. Listen in for all the usual recommendations, and a chance to find out if you're an Arcadian or a Utopian.

What does it mean to write into archival silence? How do we tell the most difficult stories? As usual, our theme is inspired by our guest, so join us as we talk about literature that looks at what happens behind closed doors, both in the literal sense - domestic spaces that are not what they seem, or hold secrets - but also those books that show us narratives that are usually left out of literature and culture.

As separation from our loved ones drags on, we're all having to find different ways to connect, and in this socially distant reality, intimacy feels more necessary than ever - however we can get it (hot tip: books are good!). Writing and reading can be intimate acts, so for this episode we'll be discussing what intimacy means in literature, which writers - from Henry James to Sally Rooney to Maggie Nelson - have been able to capture it, and what it means to write in an intimate way. Our guest this month is Garth Greenwell, a writer whose work chronicles and explores intimacy in many forms, so he couldn't be a better person to talk to.

This jam-packed special features recordings from both the events we chaired: \u2018A Body of Work\u2019 with Karen Havelin and Eleanor Thom, in which we discussed their books Please Read This Leaflet Carefully and Private Parts, including how to write about chronic/persistent pain, and endometriosis; and \u2018Me Too in Fiction\u2019, where we spoke to Rosie Price and Ayelet Gundar-Goshen about their books What Red Was and Liar, which deal with sexual assault and its aftermath in very different ways. Plus: voxpops from Max Porter, Candice Carty-Williams, Wana Udobang and Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson, who all told us what they\u2019d read and loved recently; and our utter glee at discovering the back seat of a car makes an excellent makeshift recording studio, steamed up windows and all. It\u2019s full of the good stuff to warm you up as the nights draw in."

So, join us for the next hour as we try to further decolonise our minds.\n\nEmail us: litfriction@gmail.com\nTweet us and find us on Instagram: @litfriction\n\nRecommendations on the theme, The Science of Bias:\nOctavia: Swing Time by Zadie Smith https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/565/56513/swing-time/9780141036601.html\nCarrie: Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2016/invisible-man-by-ralph-ellison/\n\nGeneral Recommendations:\nOctavia: Whereas by Layli Long Soldier https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/layli-long-soldier/whereas/9781529012804\nCarrie: Three Women by Lisa Taddeo https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/lisa-taddeo/work/three-women\nJennifer: Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/224792/just-mercy-by-bryan-stevenson/9780812984965/"

We talked to author Ann Wroe, whose latest book Francis: A Life in Song is an unusual, beautiful, moving portrait through poetry of the life of St. Francis of Assisi and his resonance today. It\u2019s an unusual and wonderful book, which has had glowing reviews, and it\u2019s a perfect way to cap off the year on Literary Friction."

But we\u2019re also preparing: this worldwide trend towards the normalisation of misogyny, racism, xenophobia and blatant disregard for truth demands action. What can we do? And what can books do? This show is about resistance, and we are joined by the perfect guest: Salena Godden, poet, author, essayist, performer, once described as  \u2018everything the Daily Mail is terrified of\u2019. She recently contributed to The Good Immigrant, a collection of writing about what it means to be black, asian and minority ethnic in Britain today, and stopped by O's kitchen for some wine, poetry, and real talk. Vive la revolution!"

                "summary": "Ever wonder if you're with the flock, or against it? British author and psychiatric doctor Joanna Cannon\u2019s debut novel The Trouble with Goats and Sheep (a Sunday Times bestseller) explores how we treat - or more often mistreat - people who don't quite fit in. It tells the story of two young girls who decide to investigate a housewife\u2019s disappearance from their tight-knit estate during the heat wave of 1976, and the unlikely truth they uncover. In honour of rebels and misfits everywhere, our theme this month is BLACK SHEEP. Join us as we interview Joanna, and discuss our favourite literary characters who stand on the margins - from Holden Caufield to Jane Eyre to Oscar Wao and more. "
