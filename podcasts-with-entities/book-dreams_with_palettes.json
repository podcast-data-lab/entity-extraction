Vaishnavi Patel\u2013author of the instant New York Times bestselling novel Kaikeyi, a reimagining of the Hindu epic the Ramayana\u2013paints a vivid picture in this episode of Book Dreams. Vaishnavi\u2019s novel \u201ctells the story of the evil stepmother character [Kaikeyi], who sets off the whole epic by exiling Rama, and then just sort of disappears.

During her conversation with Eve and Julie, Imani illuminates the connections between Southern history and pivotal aspects of contemporary American society\u2013everything from the overturning of Roe v. Wade, to episodes of mass violence, to the treatment of immigrants at the border. She also makes the case that the South could have a better claim to the name \u201cHeartland of America\u201d than the Midwest, because \u201cthe way Americans relate to the use of land and labor is so shaped by the South.\u201d\n\nImani vividly conveys, too, a duality that has pervaded the South over the course of its history, particularly for those oppressed there: on the one hand, grief, pain, and atrocity; on the other, joy, vibrancy, and beauty. \u201cI spent a lot of time,\u201d she says, \u201cthinking about how much the violence of the country was associated with sources of pleasure: \u2026 slavery, and rum and tobacco and sugar. \u2026 Then there's also the fact of people who have lived incredibly hardscrabble lives, through dispossession and also, you know, the South has been home to the deepest poverty and many forms of exploitation. And from that people have tapped into their humanity to create incredible beauty and meaning.\u201d A professor who has taught both history and law, Imani also explains why the Supreme Court's recent tethering of the constitution to the \u201cintent of the founding fathers\u201d is both bad history and bad law.\n\nImani Perry is the Hughes-Rogers Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University and a faculty associate with the Programs in Law and Public Affairs, Gender and Sexuality Studies and Jazz Studies. Her prior books include Looking for Lorraine: The Radiant and Radical Life of Lorraine Hansberry, which won the 2019 Bograd Weld Award for Biography from the PEN America Foundation and the Lambda Literary Award for LGBTQ Non-Fiction and was a New York Times notable book, among other accolades. She\u2019s also the author of Breathe: A Letter to My Sons, a Kirkus best nonfiction book of 2019 and a finalist for the NAACP Image Award in Nonfiction; Vexy Thing: On Gender and Liberation; and May We Forever Stand: A History of the Black National Anthem, also a finalist for the NAACP Image Award in Nonfiction.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

In this episode of Book Dreams, he speaks with Eve and Julie about why he chose Trust\u2019s innovative and surprising structure, and how that structure first reinforces and then deconstructs misconceptions about money. In a surprise move, he deliberately designed one segment of the book to be \u201ca little off-putting \u2026 even a little boring, because that is the way we are spoken to when it comes to money and power machinations. \u2026 The message is, don't bother yourself with this.\u201d Hernan also discusses his views on everything from the ways in which fiction shapes reality, to the societal implications of the \u201cHow was your experience?\u201d buttons that are now appearing in airport bathrooms across the nation.\n\nHernan Diaz is a Pulitzer Prize and PEN Faulkner Award finalist, and the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship. His first novel, In the Distance, was the winner of the Saroyan International Prize and was named one of Publisher\u2019s Weekly\u2019s top 10 books of the year and one of Lit Hub\u2019s 20 best novels of the decade, among many other accolades. He has published stories and essays in The Paris Review, Granta, and McSweeney\u2019s. Trust is his second novel. It was long-listed for the Booker Prize and is a finalist for the Kirkus Prize.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

She discusses, too, her most famous essay, \u201cThe Fourth State of Matter\u201d and wonders aloud about herself, \u201cWhy are you talking about this essay that you never talk about?\u201d Published in The New Yorker in 1996, \u201cThe Fourth State of Matter\u201d depicts a mass shooting at the University of Iowa lab where Jo Ann worked. \u201cHow do you take something like that, which is essentially meaningless, and infuse it with meaning?\u201d Jo Ann asks during this Book Dreams episode. And she offers an answer to that heartbreaking question. (This episode was originally released on 8/12/21.)\n\nJo Ann has received a Whiting Foundation Award and nonfiction fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation and the New York Foundation for the Arts. She\u2019s the author of the groundbreaking collection of autobiographical essays The Boys of My Youth and the novel In Zanesville. Her work has appeared in The New Yorker, Tin House, Best American Essays, and the O. Henry Prize anthologies.

Much to his surprise, he soon found himself confiding in her. She told him not to worry\u2013strangers divulged secrets to her all the time\u2013whereupon he offered her a job as a private investigator.

                "summary": "Tensions are running high at Book Dreams! Why? The fantasy novels of author Susanna Clarke, that's why. After Julie--and multiple Book Dreams guests--strongly recommended Clarke's novel Piranesi, Eve gave it a try, only to quickly toss it on her DNR pile. Outraged, Julie insisted that Eve not only finish Piranesi, but also dig into Clarke's 800-page doorstopper Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. Can Eve see the error of her ways? (Can you tell who is writing this description?) Is she still speaking to Julie? Should you read the work of this divisive maestro? Take a listen to this week's episode to find out.\n\nSusanna Clarke's debut novel, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, was first published in more than 34 countries and was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize and shortlisted for the Whitbread First Novel Award and the Guardian First Book Award. It won British Book Awards Newcomer of the Year, the Hugo Award, and the World Fantasy Award in 2005. The Ladies of Grace Adieu, her collection of short stories, some set in the world of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, was published by Bloomsbury in 2006. Piranesi was a New York Times and Sunday Times bestseller, and shortlisted for the Costa Novel of the Year Award, the RSL Encore Award, and the Women's Prize for Fiction.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

They hunted and may have used fire and made stone tools. Despite their small brains, some scientists believe they may have had mental abilities similar to ours.

Eve and Julie talk with Gregory and then Rebecca about what our ancient relatives teach us about ourselves\u2013and whether it\u2019s possible that one of these hominins is still alive today.\n\n\nGregory Forth received his doctorate at the University of Oxford and was a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta for more than three decades. He's a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and is the author of more than a hundred scholarly papers and several academic books. Between Ape and Human: An Anthropologist on the Trail of a Hidden Hominoid is his first book for a general audience.\n\n\nRebecca Wragg Sykes is an archeologist, author, and honorary Fellow in the School of Archeology, Classics, and Egyptology at the University of Liverpool. Her doctoral thesis, awarded in 2010, was the first synthesis of evidence for late Neanderthals in Britain. Her critically acclaimed and bestselling first book, Kindred: Neanderthal Life, Love, Death and Art, is a deep dive into the 21st century science and understanding of these ancient relatives. Kindred won the 2021 PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize for History, was awarded Book of the Year by Current Archeology, and was selected as one of 2021\u2019s 100 Notable Books by The New York Times and a Book of the Year by the Sunday Times.\n\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

They talk about the lasting power of classics like Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood, and also about Jack\u2019s new translation of The Original Bambi: The Story of a Life in the Forest, by the Austro-Hungarian Jewish writer Felix Salten, which was the source material for the 1942 Disney film.\n\nJack explains that the novel is \u201ca brilliant and profound story of how minority groups throughout the world have been brutally treated,\u201d an \u201callegory about the weak and powerless\u201d that is both \u201cdystopic and sobering.\u201d By contrast, \u201cThe stupidity of the movie is so outrageous that as I was doing research on this book, I literally almost threw up.\u201d They talk, too, about how Jack\u2019s experiences as an activist leader during the social upheavals of the 1960s lead him to a career in children\u2019s literature: \u201cI realized if there's going to be a movement that really digs in and has roots in the majority of people, we have to learn how to teach critically and develop methods in which children would be able to begin to think for themselves and continue to be curious, ask questions, and also take interest in groups in the United States with which they are not familiar.\u201d\n\nJack Zipes is Professor Emeritus of German and Comparative Literature at the University of Minnesota.

They talk about the lasting power of classics like Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood, and also about Jack\u2019s new translation of The Original Bambi: The Story of a Life in the Forest, by the Austro-Hungarian Jewish writer Felix Salten, which was the source material for the 1942 Disney film.\n\n\nJack explains that the novel is \u201ca brilliant and profound story of how minority groups throughout the world have been brutally treated,\u201d an \u201callegory about the weak and powerless\u201d that is both \u201cdystopic and sobering.\u201d By contrast, \u201cThe stupidity of the movie is so outrageous that as I was doing research on this book, I literally almost threw up.\u201d They talk, too, about how Jack\u2019s experiences as an activist leader during the social upheavals of the 1960s lead him to a career in children\u2019s literature: \u201cI realized if there's going to be a movement that really digs in and has roots in the majority of people, we have to learn how to teach critically and develop methods in which children would be able to begin to think for themselves and continue to be curious, ask questions, and also take interest in groups in the United States with which they are not familiar.\u201d\n\n\nJack Zipes is Professor Emeritus of German and Comparative Literature at the University of Minnesota. He has written, translated, and edited dozens of books, including The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm, Why Fairy Tales Stick, and Don't Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Feminist Fairy Tales of North America and England. In addition to his scholarly work, Jack is an active storyteller in public schools and has worked with children's theaters in Europe and the United States. Among his many awards are a Guggenheim Fellowship, the International Brothers Grimm Award, and the World Fantasy Convention Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2018, Jack founded the publishing house, Little Mole & Honey Bear, which republishes historical children\u2019s books with timeless values in order to \u201cpreserve the things that make us human and stand up to forces that would tear our society apart.\u201d\n\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

One of our prior guests, Nancy Pearl\u2013a librarian so renowned, she inspired a librarian action figure\u2013has this to say about the first book in the series: \"The more I think about it (and I've been thinking about it a lot), the more I believe that Sara Gran's Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead is one of the very best mysteries I've ever read.\" Sara's latest novel, The Book of the Most Precious Substance, which the New York Times deems \"palpably seductive,\u201d was published by Sara's new small press, Dreamland Books.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

                "summary": "What makes us human?\n\nIn this episode, Eve and Julie explore one of our favorite questions with James Suzman, PhD, in a wide-ranging conversation about his book Work: A Deep History, from the Stone Age to the Age of Robots. They talk about which aspects of work are specific to our species and how so much of what we believe to be intrinsic to work is actually just a product of our culture. James also discusses how the way we evolved to find purpose and meaning in work is what distinguishes us from bacteria; why modern people work far more hours a week than we need to; and how we may be in a \u201cplastic moment\u201d where radical changes in the way we work may be possible.\n\nA noted anthropologist specializing in the Khoisan peoples of Southern Africa, James Suzman spent thirty years studying the Ju/\u2019hoansi people, a hunter-gatherer society in southern Africa\u2019s Kalihari desert, whose economic models provide a fascinating contrast to our own. A recipient of the Smuts Commonwealth Fellowship in African Studies at Cambridge University, he is now the Director of Anthropos Limited, a think tank that applies anthropological methods to solving contemporary, social, and economic problems. James\u2019s first book, Affluence Without Abundance: What We Can Learn from the World's Most Successful Civilisation, was a 2019 NPR Best Book of the Year and a Washington Post Notable Book. Work: A Deep History from the Stone Age to the Age of Robots was an Amazon Best Book of the Month.

Turns out, more than you might think.\n\nIn 2004 a group of libertarians founded the Free Town Project, a movement to take over a town and turn it into a libertarian utopia.

In this case, the heroines are two sisters named Elinor and Marianne, representing the \u2018sense\u2019 (prudence, restraint) and \u2018sensibility\u2019 (passion, impulsiveness) of the title. In this episode, Jacke takes a look at the writing of Sense & Sensibility; the still common themes contained within this classic novel; and the 1995 film adaptation, in which Emma Thompson, herself in the midst of an Austen-like entanglement, nevertheless drives a shiv into Jacke\u2019s battered old heart.\u201d\n\nListen to History of Literature on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nYou can find Book Dreams on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nBook Dreams is a part Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

                "summary": "This week we\u2019re running an episode from the fabulous podcast, History of Literature, about one of our favorite authors, Jane Austen. Each week on his podcast, literature enthusiast\u2013and dear friend of Book Dreams\u2013Jacke Wilson journeys through the history of literature, from ancient epics to contemporary classics. Recent episodes include conversations about Kafka; about the wonderful world of mysteries; and about poet-novelist Stephen Crane.\n\nHere\u2019s Jacke\u2019s description of the episode we\u2019re airing now on Book Dreams: \u201c\u2018I am never too busy to think of S&S,\u2019 Jane Austen wrote to her sister, referring to her 1811 novel by its initials. \u2018I can no more forget it, than a mother can forget her suckling child.\u2019 Sense & Sensibility was Jane Austen\u2019s first published novel. First begun when she was in the throes of her doomed dalliance with Thomas Lefroy, the novel contains the familiar Austen project of a Hero, a Heroine, a Search for Love, and the Obstacle Called Money. In this case, the heroines are two sisters named Elinor and Marianne, representing the \u2018sense\u2019 (prudence, restraint) and \u2018sensibility\u2019 (passion, impulsiveness) of the title. In this episode, Jacke takes a look at the writing of Sense & Sensibility; the still common themes contained within this classic novel; and the 1995 film adaptation, in which Emma Thompson, herself in the midst of an Austen-like entanglement, nevertheless drives a shiv into Jacke\u2019s battered old heart.\u201d\n\nListen to History of Literature on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nYou can find Book Dreams on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nBook Dreams is a part Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

Kevin explains how these experiences and more contributed to \u201c[t]wo decades of hardship, contemplation, and experimentation [that] brought [Dostoevsky] to a spectacular period of creativity in which he wrote four of the greatest novels in Russian literature\u2014in all literature.\u201d Kevin also recounts the story of Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Lacenaire, the real-life criminal who became the model for Raskolnikov, the murderer depicted in Crime and Punishment.\n\nKevin Birmingham is the author of The Sinner and the Saint: Dostoevsky and the Gentleman Murderer Who Inspired a Masterpiece, which was a New York Times Book Review Editors\u2019 Choice. He is also the author of the New York Times bestseller The Most Dangerous Book: The Battle for James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, which won the PEN New England Award and The Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism. Kevin has been named a Public Scholar by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and he received his PhD in English from Harvard. His writing has appeared in Harpers, The New York Times Book Review, Slate, and The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

If the person in question is author Tochi Onyebuchi, the answer is yes.\n\nIn this episode, Julie and Eve talk with Tochi about his new novel, Goliath, a sweeping science fiction epic set in a post-apocalyptic America only thirty years from today. They also talk about Tochi\u2019s other new big project: in April Marvel Comics is debuting a new \u201cCaptain America\u201d series, written by Tochi, that stars Sam Wilson as the first Black Captain America. In this wide ranging interview, Julie, Eve, and Tochi discuss everything from how he interwove themes of race, class, gentrification, climate change, and allyship in Goliath to what it was like for Tochi to go from being a Marvel fan to a Marvel author. Tochi describes, too, the array of themes that he is exploring with this new \u201cCaptain America\u201d series: \u201cIf Captain America is a mimesis or even a synecdoche of America, then\u2026what is it gonna look like if Captain America, as embodied in Sam Wilson, is enlisted in an effort at regime change? \u2026 What is that going to mean for Captain America, as is the subtitle of the book, \u2018a symbol of truth\u2019?\u201d\n\nTochi Onyebuchi is the author of the new novel Goliath, which is a New York Times Editor's Choice pick and the most anticipated pick for USA Today, Bustle, Buzzfeed, Goodreads, and Nerdist. He is also the author of the \u201cBeasts Made of Night\u201d series, \u201cThe War Girls\u201d series, Marvel's \u201cBlack Panther Legends\u201d limited series, and Marvel\u2019s upcoming \u201cCaptain America: Symbol of Truth\u201d series. His first novel for adults, Riot Baby, was a finalist for the Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and NAACP Image awards, and winner of the New England Book Award for Fiction, the Ignite Award for Best Novella, and the World Fantasy Award.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

In this week\u2019s episode of Book Dreams, Julie and Eve speak with Dr. Ann Wolbert Burgess, the inspiration for the psychological expert, Wendy Carr, on one of Eve and Julie\u2019s favorite Netflix series, \u201cMindhunter,\u201d as well as her co-author Stephen Matthew Constantine.\n\nIn the 1970s a small team of agents in the FBI\u2019s Behavioral Science Unit decided to interview convicted serial killers in an attempt to begin to understand their motives. However, the agents weren\u2019t trained in research methods or psychology, and there was concern that all they had were recordings of \u201ca bunch of sickos fantasizing about their crimes and not offering much else.\u201d Impressed by Dr. Burgess\u2019s revolutionary research into the offenders and victims of sexual crimes, they sought her advice. Initially the only woman in the unit, she directed their methodology and spent the next two decades helping to develop what became the FBI\u2019s system of criminal profiling.\n\nAnn and Steven discuss her new memoir, which Steven co-authored, A Killer by Design: Murderers, Mindhunters, and My Quest to Decipher the Criminal Mind. They talk about some of the earliest instances\u2013and validating successes\u2013of profiling serial killers like BTK; how the team\u2019s methods allowed them to predict key characteristics of the killers with astonishing detail; and why a focus on the victim often plays a pivotal role. Ann also describes what serial killers are like in person and how she was able to overcome the gruesome nature of the crimes and remain focused on the work.\n\nDr. Ann Wolbert Burgess is a leading forensic and psychiatric nurse who worked with the FBI for over two decades. She's received numerous awards nationally and internationally for her professional work. She's currently a professor at the Boston College Connell School of Nursing, and she lives in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nStephen Constantine is the assistant director of marketing and communications at the Boston College Connell School of Nursing. He holds an MFA from the Bennington College Writing Seminars, and he lives in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

                "summary": "In 2019, a librarian at the Central Library in Bristol, England, uncovered a mystery. Pasted to the bindings of four Renaissance books were scraps of parchment from a medieval manuscript. And on these scraps, written in old French, were two names that have captivated readers for almost a millennium: Merlin and Arthur.\n\nIn this week\u2019s episode, Eve and Julie talk about the origins and the enduring power of the Arthurian legends with Dr. Laura Chuhan Campbell, part of an interdisciplinary team of scholars who worked for two years to decipher the scraps and determine their provenance. What exactly did the scraps say? How did they make their way from a 13th century bookshop in France, where they were written, to inside the bindings of four Renaissance books in England? And could the fragments of this Arthurian legend manuscript\u2013written less than 50 years after the original King Arthur story\u2013change our understanding of Merlin and King Arthur? Laura describes in detail the extensive expertise employed by the team, and she shares why the \u201cBritish national myth\u201d of King Arthur has endured today. Eve also gets to finally put to use her \u201cteeny tiny sliver\u201d of knowledge of early modern demonic texts.\n\nDr. Laura Chuhan Campbell is an Assistant Professor in the School of Modern Languages and Cultures at Durham University and a member of the Institute of Medieval and Modern Studies. Her research interests include medieval French and Italian literature, particularly the area of cultural adaptations of literary texts. Her first book, The Medieval Merlin Tradition in France and Italy: Prophecy, Paradox, and Translation, examines vernacular translations of the story of Merlin in French and Italian medieval literature. Now, along with Professor Leah Tether and Dr. Benjamin Pohl, Laura is a co-author of The Bristol Merlin: Revealing the Secrets of a Medieval Fragment.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

In her conversation with Julie and Eve, Deesha describes the personal journey she took away from the Church and how she began to follow her own desires, just as the characters in her stories do. She discusses, too, why she is \u201cadamant about \u2026 writing in a way where the only gaze is the Black gaze,\u201d and how \u201cwe can write very culturally specific stories that other people who don't share those cultural specifics can still connect with.

Her writing about race, parenting, gender, and culture has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, McSweeney's, The Rumpus, and Harvard Review.

Bryan Doerries\u2013author of many books involving ancient Greek plays and Artistic Director of Theater of War Productions\u2013talks with Julie and Eve about the tragic loss in his life that caused Greek plays to suddenly begin \u201csp[eaking] directly to me as if they've been written for me.\u201d As a director, he has since sought \u201caudience[s] that have experienced the extremities of life\u201d--he\u2019s performed at hospitals, for the military, in prisons, for addicts, and for the survivors of natural disasters. Bryan discusses what it is about ancient Greek plays that make them resonate all these centuries later. He also details why the audience discussions that follow the play can be more meaningful than the performances themselves. Finally, Bryan explains how the protocols of theatergoing today are a \u201ckind of violence.\u201d\n\nBryan Doerries is a writer, director, and translator. His theater company presents dramatic readings of seminal plays and texts to frame community conversations about pressing issues of public health and social justice. He has received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Kenyon College. And he was named Public Artist in Residence for the city of New York. Bryan\u2019s most recent book, which offers a contemporary translation of ancient Greek tragedies, is Oedipus Trilogy: New Versions of Sophocles' Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

Researching and writing her novels, Kaitlyn Greenidge--author of Libertie and We Love You, Charlie Freeman--\u201capproach[es] Black history from a place of abundance, from the idea that Black people have always been multifaceted, have always been fighting for freedom, and have always been coming up with ingenious ways to combat the world around us.\u201d This week on Book Dreams, Kaitlyn discusses with Eve and Julie how society has emphasized exceptionalism in Black history to the detriment of Black people. She searches in unexpected places for evidence of the inner lives of the unexceptional, like Black spirituals. She also examines the difference between Black artists being forgotten and choosing not to be found.\n\nKaitlyn Greenidge is the recipient of fellowships from The Whiting Foundation, The National Endowment for the Arts, The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies, The Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton University, and The Guggenheim Foundation.

Joshua also gives Eve and Julie a peek behind the curtain of his mentorship with the mysterious and nocturnal magic artist Juan Tamariz, whom magic scholars consider the greatest living magician of this century.\n\nJoshua Jay is a former world champion in close-up magic and a Guinness record holder for card tricks. He makes frequent appearances on TV shows like Jimmy Fallon and The Late Late Show with James Corden, and he even fooled Penn & Teller on Fool Us. He's performed in lecture halls all over the world and has authored four books on magic in addition to How Magicians Think.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

This week on Book Dreams, Sanjena Sathian--using the particular stories of two Indian American families in her debut novel Gold Diggers to access a universal story--shares thoughts on these questions and more.\n\n\nSanjena Sathian is a graduate of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, an alumna of the Clarion Writers\u2019 Workshop and a former Paul & Daisy Soros Fellow.

                "summary": "In this episode of Book Dreams, Julie and Eve talk with Charles Person, the youngest and only surviving member of the original Freedom Riders. In May of 1961, thirteen men and women in Washington, D.C. boarded two public buses headed for New Orleans, to test whether states across the South were abiding by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision forbidding segregation in bus depots, waiting areas, restaurants, and restrooms. Charles was only eighteen at the time. Now, six decades later, he recounts the day his fight for racial equity and justice nearly cost him and his fellow Riders their lives.\n\nThe author of the recently released Buses Are a Comin\u2019: Memoir of a Freedom Rider, Charles tells Eve and Julie how his early experiences with systemic racism led him to become active in the civil rights movement and get on board the bus. Charles also gives vivid and vital oral testimony about the murderous attacks on the Freedom Riders by Klansmen and other white supremacists in Alabama. Those Freedom Riders included some of the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement: Congressman John Lewis, Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) Director James Farmer, CORE Field Secretary Genevieve Hughes, Reverend Benjamin Elting Cox, and writer and pacifist James Peck.\n\nAfter the Freedom Ride, Charles joined the Marines and served for twenty years, including nine months in Vietnam. Today, he lives in Atlanta, where he is a sought-after public speaker.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

Jo Ann describes her deeply reflective, painstaking process and shares why so many of the pieces in Festival Days involve life and death moments and the kinds of reminiscences that emerge from thoughts about death. She discusses, too, her most famous essay, \u201cThe Fourth State of Matter\u201d and wonders aloud about herself, \u201cWhy are you talking about this essay that you never talk about?\u201d Published in The New Yorker in 1996, \u201cThe Fourth State of Matter\u201d depicts a mass shooting at the University of Iowa lab where Jo Ann worked. \u201cHow do you take something like that, which is essentially meaningless, and infuse it with meaning?\u201d Jo Ann asks during this Book Dreams episode. And she offers an answer to that heartbreaking question.\n\nJo Ann has received a Whiting Foundation Award and nonfiction fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation and the New York Foundation for the Arts. She\u2019s the author of the groundbreaking collection of autobiographical essays The Boys of My Youth and the novel In Zanesville. Her work has appeared in The New Yorker, Tin House, Best American Essays, and the O. Henry Prize anthologies. She teaches writing at Sarah Lawrence College.\n\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\n\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

We had a little real estate problem.\u201d--Charlie Hill, comedian and member of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin.\nIn this week\u2019s episode, Julie and Eve talk to comedian, writer, and actor Adrianne Chalepah and comedy historian Kliph Nesteroff about Native Americans and comedy. An enrolled member of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma and a member of the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma, Adrianne has been a stand-up comedian for more than a decade. She\u2019s the founder of the indigenous femme comedy troupe, Ladies of Native Comedy, and she plays the role of Shannon Diabo on Peacock\u2019s hit show \u201cRutherford Falls.\u201d Kliph was a stand-up comic for eight years. He\u2019s the author of The Comedians: Drunks, Thieves, Scoundrels, and the History of American Comedy and, most recently, We Had a Little Real Estate Problem: The Unheralded Story of Native Americans & Comedy.\nIn her conversation with Eve and Julie, Adrianne describes how before becoming a professional comedian, she was kicked out of public school for being a class clown and then sent to a U.S. government-run boarding school for Native American children. She also discusses whether the increasing success of Native American comedians like herself and others is indicative of lasting change.\nKliph shares stories about Charlie Hill, the first Native American comedian to appear on network television and how he revolutionized opportunities for Native American comedians.\u00a0\nFind us on Twitter (@bookdreamspod) and Instagram (@bookdreamspodcast), or email us at contact@bookdreamspodcast.com.\nWe encourage you to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter for information about our episodes, guests, and more.\nBook Dreams is a part of Lit Hub Radio and the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.

Dr. Sally Roesch Wagner--founder and executive director of the Matilda Joslyn Gage Foundation and Center for Social Justice Dialogue; a founder of one the first college-level women\u2019s studies programs in the United States; and author of The Women\u2019s Suffrage Movement and Sisters in Spirit--introduces Eve and Julie to Matilda Joslyn Gage, the should-be household name of the suffrage movement whom Gloria Steinem called \u201cthe woman who was ahead of the women who were ahead of their time.\u201d Sally has dedicated her life\u2019s work to restoring Gage to her rightful place in history.
