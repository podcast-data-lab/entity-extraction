    "description": "<p>Journalist and bestselling author Michael Lewis takes a searing look at what&rsquo;s happened to fairness in American life through the lens of people who depend on public trust. After exploring what&rsquo;s happened to referees and coaches, the third season of Against the Rules tackles what&rsquo;s happened to our trust in experts and expertise. An expert has probably saved your life more than once. So why is it so hard to judge who the real experts are? And why, once we&rsquo;ve found them, do we struggle to listen to what experts have to say? In this season, we meet oceanographers and baseball writers, nurses and former gang members &mdash; people who don&rsquo;t have a lot in common but the mixed blessing of their expertise.</p>\r\n<p>iHeartMedia is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries.</p>",

As with all of his books, Lewis is talking with experts to get background context on the world his characters inhabit. For the first time, these interviews will be recorded, on the record.\nIn this special monthly series from Against the Rules, we'll hear Lewis in conversation with experts such as a tech wizard who traces secrets on the blockchain; a scholar of white-collar crime and punishment; a regulator who knows what crypto firms are \u2013 and aren\u2019t \u2013 allowed to do with other people\u2019s billions; and an insider who can follow the influence of crypto on campaign finance. \n\u201cOn Background\u201d from Michael Lewis and Against the Rules drops monthly, starting February 14th, 2023.\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

After exploring what\u2019s happened to referees and coaches, the third season of Against the Rules tackles what\u2019s happened to our trust in experts and expertise. An expert has probably saved your life more than once. So why is it so hard to judge who the real experts are? And why, once we\u2019ve found them, do we struggle to listen to what experts have to say? In this season, we meet oceanographers and baseball writers, nurses and former gang members \u2014 people who don\u2019t have a lot in common but the mixed blessing of their expertise.\r\n\r\niHeartMedia is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries."
