Hannah also takes an in-depth look at the challenges and potential of building artificial general intelligence (AGI) and explores what it takes to ensure AI is built to benefit society.\n\u201cI hope this series gives people a better understanding of AI and a feeling for just how exhilarating an endeavour it is.\u201d \u2013 Demis Hassabis, CEO and Co-Founder of DeepMind\nFor questions or feedback on the series, message us on Twitter @DeepMind or email podcast@deepmind.com.\nCredits\nPresenter: Hannah Fry\nSeries Producer: Dan Hardoon\nProduction support: Jill Achineku\nSounds design: Emma Barnaby\nMusic composition: Eleni Shaw\nSound Engineer: Nigel Appleton\nEditor: David Prest\nCommissioned by DeepMind",
