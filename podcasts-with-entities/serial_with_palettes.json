Then a surgical procedure called egg retrieval caused them excruciating pain.\n\nSome of the patients screamed out in the procedure room. Others called the clinic from home to report pain in the hours that followed. But most of the staff members who fielded the patients\u2019 reports did not know the real reason for the pain, which was that a nurse at the clinic was stealing fentanyl, and replacing it with saline.\n\nFrom Serial Productions and The New York Times, The Retrievals is a five-part narrative series reported by Susan Burton, a veteran staff member at \u201cThis American Life\u201d and author of the memoir \u201cEmpty.\u201d\n\nSusan details the events that unfolded at the clinic, and examines how the patients\u2019 distinct identities informed the way they made sense of what happened to them in the procedure room. The nurse, too, has her own story, about her own pain, that she tells to the court. And then there is the story of how this all could have happened at the Yale clinic in the first place.\n\nThroughout, Burton explores the stories we tell about women\u2019s pain. How do we tolerate, interpret and account for it? What happens when pain is minimized or dismissed?\n\nEpisode 1 of The Retrievals arrives Thursday, June 29th.",
