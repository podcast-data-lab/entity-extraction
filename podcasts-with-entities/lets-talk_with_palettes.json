The people of Israel were tempted to bow down to literal idols, and in many parts of the world, literal idols and effigies are still believed to hold enormous power. But in the post-Christian West, idolatry\u2014though harder to define\u2014is just as prevalent.\nOn this episode of Let's Talk, Jackie Hill Perry, Jasmine Holmes, and Melissa Kruger talk about how and why we are tempted to make idols. Although some may think we slip into idolatry when we want too much, Jackie says that, actually, \u201cIdolatry is wanting too little.\u201d When we make idols, she says, we're looking to something that has been created to deliver us. But we need to look higher, above what is created to our Creator.\nMentioned in this Episode:\nThe Expulsive Power of a New Affection by Thomas Chalmers\nRelated Resources:\n\nSin as Idolatry (essay)\nHow to Expose the Idols in Your Life\nJuan Sanchez on Image, Identity, and Idolatry (podcast)",

And while cancel culture can bring great harm, it's existence points to the fact that not all judgment is bad. Jasmine Holmes says, \"Even in our culture that is not a largely Christian culture, we understand that to judge is to protect. We want to make a judgment about people who are putting others in danger. We want to make a judgment about people who are victimizing others.\"</p><p>In this episode of <a href=\"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/podcasts/lets-talk-podcast/\">Let's Talk</a>, Jasmine Holmes, Jackie Hill Perry, and Melissa Kruger talk about the confusion around a biblical view of judgment. They discuss the questions of when it's right and when it's wrong to judge others, and whether it's possible to make right judgments with the wrong heart attitude. They talk about the difference in judging those inside the church and out. Ultimately, the gospel and our own need for grace must inform how and why we judge other people.</p><p><strong>Related Resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/judge-people-like-jesus-did/\">Judge People!

We may dismiss sins of speech, from gossip to complaining to tearing someone down, as minor. But James compares the damage our words can do to a blazing forest fire lit by just a spark (3:5).</p><p>Jackie points out that Christians often say online what they would not say to someone's face. But if we truly fear God, we would honor him with our online speech. Melissa talks about how gossip breeds false intimacy in the moment, but ultimately destroys trust in a friendship.
