    "description": "I\u2019ve spent over 20 years studying the emotions and experiences that bring meaning and purpose to our lives, and if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s this: We are hardwired for connection, and connecting requires courage, vulnerability, and conversation. I want this to be a podcast that\u2019s real, unpolished, honest, and reflects both the magic and the messiness of what it means to be human. Episodes will include conversations with the people who are teaching me, challenging me, confusing me, or maybe even ticking me off a little. I'll also have direct conversations with you about what I\u2019m learning from new research, and we'll do some episodes dedicated to answering your questions. We don\u2019t have to do life alone. We were never meant to.",

I want this to be a podcast that\u2019s real, unpolished, honest, and reflects both the magic and the messiness of what it means to be human. Episodes will include conversations with the people who are teaching me, challenging me, confusing me, or maybe even ticking me off a little. I'll also have direct conversations with you about what I\u2019m learning from new research, and we'll do some episodes dedicated to answering your questions. We don\u2019t have to do life alone. We were never meant to."
