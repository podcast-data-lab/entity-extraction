They also explore the legendary hackers conference known as DEF CON and hear from technologists campaigning for a global ban on autonomous weapons.\n\nWe close with a conversation between host Al Letson and Fryer-Biggs about the implications of algorithmic warfare and how the U.S. and other leaders in machine learning are resistant to signing treaties that would put limits on machines capable of making battlefield decisions.\u00a0\n\nThis episode originally aired in <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/podcast/weapons-with-minds-of-their-own/\" target=\"_blank\">June 2021</a>.\n\n\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a>\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"http://revealnews.org?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/newsletter</a>\nConnect with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>\n\n      "

            "content": "\n        <p>In this week\u2019s episode, produced in collaboration with the Associated Press, reporters on the front lines take us inside Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and share never-before-heard recordings of Russian soldiers.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The day President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion, Feb. 24, 2022, Russia unleashed a brutal assault on the strategic port city of Mariupol. That same day, a team of AP reporters arrived in the city. Vasilisa Stepanenko, Evgeniy Maloletka and Mstyslav Chernov kept their cameras and tape recorders rolling throughout the onslaught. Together, they captured some of the defining images of the war in Ukraine. Stepanenko and Maloletka talk with guest host Michael Montgomery about risking their lives to document blasted buildings, burned-out cars, enormous bomb craters and the daily life of traumatized civilians. As Russian troops advanced on Mariupol, the journalists managed to escape with hours of their own material and recordings from the body camera of a noted Ukrainian medic, Yuliia Paievska. The powerful footage went viral and showed the world the shocking brutalities of the war, as well as remarkable acts of courage by journalists, doctors and ordinary citizens.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Next, we listen to audio that\u2019s never been publicly shared before: phone calls Russian soldiers made during the first weeks of the invasion, secretly recorded by the Ukrainian government. AP reporter Erika Kinetz obtained more than 2,000 of these calls. Using social media and other tools, she explores the lives of two soldiers whose calls home capture intimate moments with friends and family. The intercepted calls reveal the fear-mongering and patriotism that led some of the men to go from living regular lives as husbands, sons and fathers to talking about killing civilians.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, Russian soldiers left streets strewn with the bodies of civilians killed during their brief occupation. Kinetz shares her experiences visiting Bucha and speaking with survivors soon after Russian troops retreated. In the secret intercepts, Russian soldiers tell their families about being ordered to take no prisoners and speak of \u201ccleansing operations.\u201d One soldier tells his mother: \u201cWe don\u2019t imprison them. We kill them all.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Will Russian soldiers and political leaders be prosecuted for war crimes? Montgomery talks with Oleksandra Matviichuk, a Ukrainian human rights lawyer who received a 2022 Nobel Peace Prize. She runs the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv, which has been gathering evidence of human rights abuses and war crimes in Ukraine since Russia\u2019s first invasion in 2014. Matviichuk says it\u2019s important for war crimes to be handled by Ukrainian courts, but the country\u2019s legal system is overwhelmed and notoriously corrupt.

Gay lives with serious mental illness, and after time in solitary confinement, he began to act out.

But the company also relied on forced prison labor. After US Steel took over Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; Railroad in 1907, the industrial giant used prison labor for at least five more years. During that time, more than 100 men died while working in their massive coal mining operation in Alabama. U.S. Steel has misrepresented this dark chapter of its history. And it has never apologized for its use of forced labor or the lives lost. The reporters push the company to answer questions about its past and engage with communities near the former mines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>This is an update of an episode that originally aired <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/podcast/locked-up-the-prison-labor-that-built-business-empires/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">September 2022</a>.</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Support Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a></em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/newsletter/?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/weekly</a></em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>Connect with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></em></strong></p>\n      ",

We tour a museum of Withers\u2019 photographs with his daughter Roz, who deconstructs his famous \u201cI Am a Man\u201d photo of striking sanitation workers.

Perrusquia gained access to thousands of reports and photos taken for the FBI by Withers. We hear excerpts from several reports and meet the daughter of the agent who recruited Withers. During the 1950s, \u201960s and \u201970s, the bureau recruited thousands of informants as part of a covert program originally created to monitor communists in America but ended up targeting the civil rights movement, as well as other individuals and groups.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We close with reflections on Withers by people who knew him.

                "subtitle": "Photographer Ernest Withers chronicled the civil rights movement. Did he also betray it?",
                "summary": "\n        Some of the most enduring photos of the civil rights movement were taken by Ernest Withers. A native of Memphis, Tennessee, Withers earned the trust of Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders. But as it turns out, he was secretly taking photos for the federal government as well. This week, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Wesley Lowery brings us the story of Withers in an adaptation of the podcast \u201cUnfinished: Ernie\u2019s Secret,\u201d from Scripps News and Stitcher.\n\nLowery starts by explaining how Withers earned his reputation as a chronicler of the civil rights movement. We tour a museum of Withers\u2019 photographs with his daughter Roz, who deconstructs his famous \u201cI Am a Man\u201d photo of striking sanitation workers. Civil rights leader Andrew Young explains that without Withers\u2019 photographs, they wouldn\u2019t have had a movement.\n\nWe then learn that after Withers\u2019 death, a Memphis reporter named Marc Perrusquia followed up on an old lead about the photographer: that he was secretly working for the FBI. Perrusquia gained access to thousands of reports and photos taken for the FBI by Withers. We hear excerpts from several reports and meet the daughter of the agent who recruited Withers. During the 1950s, \u201960s and \u201970s, the bureau recruited thousands of informants as part of a covert program originally created to monitor communists in America but ended up targeting the civil rights movement, as well as other individuals and groups.\u00a0\n\nWe close with reflections on Withers by people who knew him. While some believe Withers betrayed the cause of civil rights, others are more forgiving. They say his actions were part of a larger narrative about the U.S. government\u2019s unchecked power to spy on its own citizens and extinguish ideas and movements it felt were a threat.\u00a0\n\n\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a>\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/newsletter/?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_2022_podcastdescription\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/weekly</a>\nConnect with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>\n\n      "

In this episode, they follow the rumors to defense attorney Andrew Pappas, who subpoenas the prison call log between Nordo and one of his informants. It\u2019s there he finds evidence that something is not right about the way Nordo is conducting his police work.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s Pappas\u2019 findings that prompted the Philadelphia district attorney\u2019s office to launch an investigation into Nordo. The patterns that prosecutors found by reviewing Nordo\u2019s calls and emails with incarcerated men, examining his personnel file, and interviewing men who interacted with him showed shocking coercion and abuse.</p>\n\n<p>Almost 20 years after the first complaint was filed against Nordo, the disgraced detective\u2019s actions became public. He was charged and his case went to trial. Palmer and Melamed analyze the fallout from the scandal, and seek answers from the Philadelphia Police Department on how they addressed Nordo\u2019s misconduct and how he got away with it for so long.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Support Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a></em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/newsletter/?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_2022_podcastdescription\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/weekly</a></em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Connect with us on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></em></p></li>\n</ul>\n      ",

A mostly White jury acquitted George Zimmerman of the teen\u2019s murder, in part because Florida\u2019s stand your ground law permits a person to use deadly force in self-defense \u2013 even if that person could have safely retreated. Nationwide protests after the trial called for stand your ground laws to be repealed and reformed. But instead, stand your ground laws have expanded to 38 states.\nReveal reporter Jonathan Jones talks with Byron Castillo, a maintenance worker in North Carolina who was shot in the chest after mistakenly trying to get into the wrong apartment for a repair. While Castillo wound up out of work and deep in debt, police and prosecutors declined to pursue charges against the shooter, who said he was afraid someone was trying to break into his apartment. Researchers have found that states that enacted stand your ground laws have seen an increase in homicides \u2013 one study estimated that roughly 700 more people die in the U.S. every year because of stand your ground laws.\nOpponents of stand your ground laws call them by a different name: \u201ckill at will\u201d laws. Jones speaks to lawmakers like Stephanie Howse, who fought against stand your ground legislation as an Ohio state representative, saying such laws put Black people's lives at risk. Howse and other Democratic lawmakers faced off against Republican politicians, backed by pro-gun lobbyists, intent on passing a stand your ground bill despite widespread opposition from civil rights groups and law enforcement.\nModern-day stand your ground laws started in Florida. Reveal reporter Nadia Hamdan explores a 2011 road rage incident that wound up leading to an expansion of the law.

                "summary": "\n        Sugar is a big part of Americans\u2019 daily diet, but we rarely ask where that sweet cane comes from.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn November, the United States announced that it will <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/article/us-bans-sugar-imports-dominican-republic-producer/\" target=\"_blank\">block all imports of raw sugar</a> from one of those sources: the cane fields owned by the Central Romana Corp. in the Dominican Republic. U.S. Customs and Border Protection cited labor abuses in its decision. Sugar from Central Romana feeds into the supply chains of major U.S. brands, including Domino and Hershey.\u00a0\n\nThe federal government\u2019s action follows a two-year investigation by Reveal and Mother Jones. Reporters Sandy Tolan and Euclides Cordero Nuel visited Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic who do the backbreaking work of cutting sugarcane for little pay. Central Romana is the Dominican Republic\u2019s largest private employer and has strong links to two powerful Florida businessmen, Alfonso and Pepe Fanjul. The reporters speak to workers who have no access to government pensions, so they\u2019re forced to work in the fields into their 80s for as little as $3 a day. In the 1990s, Tolan reported on human trafficking and child labor in the Dominican sugar industry. Conditions improved following pressure on the government from local activists, human rights groups and the U.S. Labor Department. But major problems have persisted.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAfter Reveal\u2019s story first aired in fall 2021, Congress took action. Fifteen members of the House Ways and Means Committee called on federal agencies to formulate a plan to address what they called the \u201cslave-like conditions\u201d in the Dominican cane fields. Central Romana also took action: It bulldozed one of the worker camps our reporters visited, claiming it was part of an improvement program. Residents say that with very little warning, they were told to pack up their lives. Central Romana denies the U.S. government\u2019s recent findings that its cane cutters are working under forced labor conditions. \n\nThis is an update of an episode that originally aired in September 2021.\u00a0\n\n\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a>\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"http://revealnews.org?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/weekly</a>\n\n\nConnect with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>\n      "

Reveal reporter Ese Olumhense travels to San Luis to report on Fuentes\u2019 case and finds she has gone from being a well-known local politician in her community to the face of right-wing campaigns against voter fraud.\u00a0\n\nFuentes\u2019 arrest and prosecution show the beginnings of an alarming trend shaping the future of how elections are surveilled and policed. Olumhense and Reveal\u2019s Melissa Lewis built a database to track all election-crimes-related bills introduced in the country since the 2020 election. They found a national push to punish what is considered in many states to be typical voting practices. Fueled in part by politicians who falsely claim voter fraud stole the 2020 election from Donald Trump, bills are being introduced that create new election crime investigation agencies, establish criminal penalties for election offenses or empower law enforcement officials to investigate such crimes.\u00a0\n\nWhile there was no proof of anything resembling widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, there is one way in which elections are rigged: gerrymandering. Mother Jones senior reporter Ari Berman delves into how Republicans redrew voting maps in Wisconsin, helping them cement control of the state Legislature. Republicans\u2019 strong hold on power has allowed them to keep in place deeply unpopular laws like an abortion ban that dates back to 1849. But this isn\u2019t about just state politics: It\u2019s also about the next election for president in 2024.\u00a0\n\n\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a>\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"http://revealnews.org?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=\" target=\"_blank\">revealnews.org/weekly</a>\nConnect with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>\n\n      "

Many in the movement have a new target: hormonal birth control. It seems contradictory; doesn\u2019t preventing unwanted pregnancies also prevent abortions? But anti-abortion groups don\u2019t see it that way. They claim that hormonal contraceptives like IUDs and the pill can actually <em>cause</em> abortions.</p>\n\n<p>One prominent group making this claim is Students for Life of America, whose president has said she wants contraceptives like IUDs and birth control pills to be illegal. The fast-growing group has built a social media campaign spreading the false idea that hormonal birth control is an abortifacient.

                "summary": "\n        Picture stepping into a drug rehab. You\u2019re looking for treatment, but instead, you get hard work for no pay. For decades, this type of rehab has quietly spread across the country. How are rehabs allowed to do this?\u00a0\n\nSome organizations argue that participants can work without pay as long as they\u2019re provided with housing and treatment. This issue was raised by a cultish organization that recruited dropouts from the hippie movement and had them sew bedazzled designer jean jackets. The clothes became a Hollywood fashion trend, and the unpaid labor propelled a case all the way to the Supreme Court.\u00a0\n\nThe federal government doesn\u2019t track work-based rehabs, so reporter Shoshana Walter spent a year counting them herself. She learned that work-based rehabs are present across the entire country. And the coronavirus pandemic has made the opioid epidemic even more deadly. As one crisis slams into another, we look at how work-based rehabs are turning participants into unpaid essential workers.\u00a0\n\n\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a>\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"http://revealnews.org?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/newsletter</a>\nConnect with us on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>\n\n      "

                "summary": "\n        There isn\u2019t a single country in the world that recognizes the Taliban as a legitimate government. And neither do many Afghans. One year after the U.S. pulled out of Afghanistan, reporter Najib Aminy checks back in with a teacher from Kabul named Aysha, who fled to the U.K. She was one of the 120,000 people airlifted out of the country as the Taliban took control. Like many other Afghan refugees, she\u2019s frustrated that the Taliban\u2019s leadership has resulted in having to leave her home country behind.\n\nWhile the Biden administration has claimed to welcome refugees from both Afghanistan and Ukraine, the process for people fleeing the two countries has been unequal. To gain temporary entry to the United States, more than 66,000 Afghans applied through a process called humanitarian parole. But the hurdles for Afghans are huge, including monthslong wait times, piles of paperwork and a steep cost ($575 per person). In contrast, after Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States created a special humanitarian parole process for Ukrainians caught in the conflict \u2013 it can be filed online and has no application fee. Government records reveal that only 123 Afghan humanitarian parole applicants have been approved, compared with 68,000 Ukrainian applicants.\n\nGuest host Ike Sriskandarajah and Aminy then head to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where $7 billion in assets belonging to Afghanistan has sat frozen since the Taliban took control of the country last year. Aminy talks with Shah Mehrabi, an economist who sits on the governing board of the Afghan central bank, who says that without access to those assets, the country\u2019s economy is headed toward collapse. The Biden administration is in a complicated position as it considers whether to release the money \u2013 and how to do it without aiding the Taliban.\n\nObaidullah Baheer is a lecturer at the American University of Afghanistan who is trying to bring the Taliban and its critics together to chart a future for the country. For Baheer, Afghan politics is personal \u2013 his grandfather served as prime minister of the country and is accused of committing war crimes that killed thousands of civilians. With that weight of personal history, Baheer is organizing Afghans to figure out how to resolve the conflicts at the heart of the country today.\n\n\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a>\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"http://revealnews.org?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/newsletter</a>\nConnect with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>\n\n      "

After decades of inaction, in 1979, President Jimmy Carter created a special unit within the Department of Justice dedicated to hunting down Nazi war criminals. Decades after passing the first substantive human rights statutes that make it possible to prosecute war criminals for crimes like torture and genocide, the U.S. has successfully prosecuted only one person under the laws. Sriskandrajah talks to experts about why prosecutors often take an \u201cAl Capone\u201d strategy to going after war criminals, pursuing them on lesser charges like immigration violations rather than human rights abuses.\u00a0\n\nWith little action from the government to prosecute war criminals, victims of violence are instead using civil lawsuits to try to seek accountability. Lawyers at the Center for Justice &amp; Accountability have brought two dozen cases against alleged war criminals and human rights violators \u2013 and never lost at trial. But when the lawyers share their evidence with the federal government, it often feels like the information disappears into a black box.\u00a0\n\nThis is a rebroadcast of an episode originally released on April 22, 2022.\n      "

We go beyond the headlines and tell the story of a pardons system that\u2019s completely broken down.\u00a0\nWe begin our show by looking at the rarest of pardons: when the person receiving a pardon is the president. When in office, Trump tweeted that he had the authority to pardon himself, a concept that first was discussed during the Nixon administration. In that case, former President Richard Nixon eventually was pardoned by the next president, Gerald Ford. In this story, we hear some rare archival tape in which Ford explains in his own words why he decided to pardon his predecessor.\nIn the next story, we look at the case of Charles \u201cDuke\u201d Tanner, a boxer who was sentenced to life in federal prison after being convicted of drug trafficking. His arrest came during the war on drugs, which started in the 1980s, disproportionately putting tens of thousands of Black men in prison for decades. Tanner applied for clemency twice; his application was just one among 13,000 others waiting for a decision at the federal Office of the Pardon Attorney when this show first aired in 2019. That number has grown to nearly 17,000 as of today. We end with a heartwarming update in the Tanner story.\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at Revealnews.org/donatenow\n\n\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at Revealnews.org/newsletter\n\n\n\nConnect with us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram",

            "content": "\n        <p>As the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, Florida is a case study in what can happen in states where abortion is easy to access.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Florida is an unexpected safe haven for people seeking abortions in the South. The state has 55 abortion clinics \u2013 more than seven other Southeastern states combined. But Florida is also increasingly an abortion battleground. Reveal found that calls to police from Florida abortion clinics for disturbances, harassment and violence have doubled since 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Reporter Laura C. Morel spent months investigating the anti-abortion movement there and observed what it\u2019s like to be an abortion provider in Jacksonville, where one particular clinic is under siege by a local anti-abortion group that has figured out a way to be near the clinic\u2019s front door. Protesters rented a room in the same office park as A Woman\u2019s Choice and now can legally, without trespassing, hold daily protests and even religious ceremonies on the private driveway that leads to the clinic. \u201cAs abortion providers, we should not have to be harassed going to work every day,\u201d clinic owner Kelly Flynn told Morel. \u201cI mean, no one's picketing the urologist that's doing vasectomies.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>For doctors who perform abortions, threats of violence are not new. In the 1980s and \u201990s, anti-abortion extremists bombed and blockaded clinics and murdered doctors. We hear from David Gunn Jr., whose father performed abortions and was murdered by a fundamentalist Christian in Pensacola in 1993. His death led to the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which makes it illegal to intimidate patients and staff at abortion clinics through force, threat of force or physical obstruction. But Morel found that this federal law, known as the FACE Act, does little to protect against the kind of harassment and intimidation providers face today.

            "contentSnippet": "As the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, Florida is a case study in what can happen in states where abortion is easy to access.\u00a0\nFlorida is an unexpected safe haven for people seeking abortions in the South. The state has 55 abortion clinics \u2013 more than seven other Southeastern states combined. But Florida is also increasingly an abortion battleground. Reveal found that calls to police from Florida abortion clinics for disturbances, harassment and violence have doubled since 2016.\nReporter Laura C. Morel spent months investigating the anti-abortion movement there and observed what it\u2019s like to be an abortion provider in Jacksonville, where one particular clinic is under siege by a local anti-abortion group that has figured out a way to be near the clinic\u2019s front door. Protesters rented a room in the same office park as A Woman\u2019s Choice and now can legally, without trespassing, hold daily protests and even religious ceremonies on the private driveway that leads to the clinic. \u201cAs abortion providers, we should not have to be harassed going to work every day,\u201d clinic owner Kelly Flynn told Morel. \u201cI mean, no one's picketing the urologist that's doing vasectomies.\u201d\u00a0\nFor doctors who perform abortions, threats of violence are not new. In the 1980s and \u201990s, anti-abortion extremists bombed and blockaded clinics and murdered doctors. We hear from David Gunn Jr., whose father performed abortions and was murdered by a fundamentalist Christian in Pensacola in 1993. His death led to the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which makes it illegal to intimidate patients and staff at abortion clinics through force, threat of force or physical obstruction. But Morel found that this federal law, known as the FACE Act, does little to protect against the kind of harassment and intimidation providers face today. At A Woman\u2019s Choice, only one person \u2013 a man who called in a bomb threat \u2013 has been prosecuted under the FACE Act.\u00a0\nWhat qualifies as \u201cintimidation\u201d varies by state. In California, it\u2019s illegal to photograph patients and staff outside abortion clinics. But at A Woman\u2019s Choice, protesters regularly photograph and film videos of patients, which staffers say makes them feel frazzled and afraid. If Roe v. Wade crumbles, abortion rights advocates warn that\u00a0 this kind of anti-abortion activism will spread, especially in places where abortion will remain legal.",

Reporter Byard Duncan talks with the Antrim County clerk, who was flooded with ugly calls and threats after her office accidentally assigned votes meant for Donald Trump to Joe Biden. While the error was quickly fixed, many in the GOP, including Trump, have used the county to sow doubt about the entire election\u2019s results. Duncan reports on the race for secretary of state, Michigan\u2019s top election official, and how the leading GOP candidate has repeatedly referenced Antrim County to question the integrity of elections. The Trump-endorsed candidate has outraised her Republican opponents by at least tenfold.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There was no meaningful election fraud in Michigan in 2020. But some local election officials who voted to certify the election have paid a price. Reporter Trey Bundy tells the story of Wayne County official Monica Palmer, a Republican who was kicked off the local canvassing board after certifying the election. And she\u2019s just one of many: Republicans have now placed new election officials on boards in eight of Michigan\u2019s largest counties. At least half of them have cast doubt on the integrity of the 2020 election.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, looking to the future, Republicans in Michigan are making it harder to vote.

Ukrainians have been living through \u201cthe long war\u201d of a threatened \u2013 and brutally real \u2013 Russian invasion for decades. We hear from 60-year-old Irina Dovgan, who refused to leave her home, with its blooming garden and many pets, when separatist fighters took over her region in 2014. She became an international symbol of the invasion after Russian-backed forces arrested, abused and publicly humiliated her. Now, Dovgan is living through a second invasion.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Reporting from Ukraine, Coda Story\u2019s Glenn Kates explains what it\u2019s been like to live in Kyiv as Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to invade. While many Ukrainians speak Russian and have deep ties to the country, Kates talks to Kyiv residents about how Putin\u2019s threats of invasion and violence have shifted their sense of identity. As the invasion approaches, each person has to weigh the nearly impossible question of what they will do to survive.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To understand what it\u2019s like to be a journalist in Ukraine and Russia right now, host Ike Sriskandarajah speaks with propaganda expert Peter Pomerantsev. Born in Ukraine and now a fellow at Johns Hopkins University and contributing editor at Coda Story, Pomerantsev describes how challenging Putin\u2019s official version of events can land journalists in prison. Under a new law, even calling the invasion an \u201cinvasion\u201d could lead to a 15-year prison sentence.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Reveal\u2019s Elizabeth Shogren takes listeners back to a time when Russia was charting a different course. In 1989, Shogren was a Moscow-based reporter covering the Soviet Union\u2019s first freely elected legislature. She talks with Russian reporter Sergey Parkhomenko about how, since Putin\u2019s election in 2000, the Russian president has consolidated power by systematically squashing dissent inside the country. This month, Parkhomenko\u2019s radio show and the whole independent Echo of Moscow network was taken off the air.

Ukrainians have been living through \u201cthe long war\u201d of a threatened \u2013 and brutally real \u2013 Russian invasion for decades. We hear from 60-year-old Irina Dovgan, who refused to leave her home, with its blooming garden and many pets, when separatist fighters took over her region in 2014. She became an international symbol of the invasion after Russian-backed forces arrested, abused and publicly humiliated her. Now, Dovgan is living through a second invasion.\u00a0\u00a0\nReporting from Ukraine, Coda Story\u2019s Glenn Kates explains what it\u2019s been like to live in Kyiv as Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to invade. While many Ukrainians speak Russian and have deep ties to the country, Kates talks to Kyiv residents about how Putin\u2019s threats of invasion and violence have shifted their sense of identity. As the invasion approaches, each person has to weigh the nearly impossible question of what they will do to survive.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo understand what it\u2019s like to be a journalist in Ukraine and Russia right now, host Ike Sriskandarajah speaks with propaganda expert Peter Pomerantsev. Born in Ukraine and now a fellow at Johns Hopkins University and contributing editor at Coda Story, Pomerantsev describes how challenging Putin\u2019s official version of events can land journalists in prison. Under a new law, even calling the invasion an \u201cinvasion\u201d could lead to a 15-year prison sentence.\u00a0\nFinally, Reveal\u2019s Elizabeth Shogren takes listeners back to a time when Russia was charting a different course. In 1989, Shogren was a Moscow-based reporter covering the Soviet Union\u2019s first freely elected legislature. She talks with Russian reporter Sergey Parkhomenko about how, since Putin\u2019s election in 2000, the Russian president has consolidated power by systematically squashing dissent inside the country. This month, Parkhomenko\u2019s radio show and the whole independent Echo of Moscow network was taken off the air. The Kremlin\u2019s harsh new censorship law, punishable by 15 years in prison, makes it illegal to call the war in Ukraine a \u201cwar.\u201d\u00a0\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at Revealnews.org/donatenow\u00a0\n\n\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at Revealnews.org/newsletter\n\n\nConnect with us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram",

They live in work camps, or \u201cbateyes,\u201d that are part of a vast sugar plantation owned by the Central Romana Corp. The company is the Dominican Republic\u2019s largest private employer and has strong links to two powerful Florida businessmen, Alfonso and Pepe Fanjul. The reporters speak to workers who have no access to government pensions, so they\u2019re forced to work in the fields into their 80s for as little as $3 a day. Through its sugar exports to the U.S. and other businesses, Central Romana generates an estimated $1.5 billion a year \u2013 but some workers are so poor they can\u2019t afford doctors\u2019 visits.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In the 1990s, Tolan reported on human trafficking and child labor in the Dominican sugar industry. Conditions improved following pressure on the government from local activists, human rights groups and the U.S. Labor Department. But major problems persist.

But who harvests some of that sweet cane?\u00a0\u00a0\nReporters Sandy Tolan and Euclides Cordero Nuel visit Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic who do the backbreaking work of cutting sugarcane for little pay. They live in work camps, or \u201cbateyes,\u201d that are part of a vast sugar plantation owned by the Central Romana Corp. The company is the Dominican Republic\u2019s largest private employer and has strong links to two powerful Florida businessmen, Alfonso and Pepe Fanjul. The reporters speak to workers who have no access to government pensions, so they\u2019re forced to work in the fields into their 80s for as little as $3 a day. Through its sugar exports to the U.S. and other businesses, Central Romana generates an estimated $1.5 billion a year \u2013 but some workers are so poor they can\u2019t afford doctors\u2019 visits.\u00a0\nIn the 1990s, Tolan reported on human trafficking and child labor in the Dominican sugar industry. Conditions improved following pressure on the government from local activists, human rights groups and the U.S. Labor Department. But major problems persist.

Reporter and episode host Ike Sriskandarajah unravels the history of the lie that there is a tiny microchip in each vial of the COVID-19 vaccine.\u00a0\nThen reporter Stan Alcorn digs into the origins of \u201cStop the Steal.\u201d In 2016, it was the name of a right-wing activist group that spread the idea that the United States\u2019 democratic institutions were rigged against Donald Trump. In 2020, it re-emerged as a hashtag attached to baseless Republican claims of voter fraud, gained huge audiences on social media and became a rallying cry among the violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol building Jan. 6.\u00a0\nWe close the show with a conversation between a mother and son who are divided over conspiracy theories. Lucy Concepcion is one of roughly 75 million Americans who believe the results of the presidential election were illegitimate. She also believes in QAnon. Her son, BuzzFeed reporter Albert Samaha, believes in facts. Samaha describes what it\u2019s like when someone you love believes in an elaborate series of lies, and we listen in as he and his mom discuss their complicated and loving relationship.",
