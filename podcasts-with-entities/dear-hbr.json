We learned that a great many of us don\u2019t in fact need to be colocated with colleagues on-site to do our jobs. Individuals, teams, entire workforces, can perform well while being entirely distributed\u2014and they have.\u201d\nBook: Time Smart: How to Reclaim Your Time and Live a Happier Life by Ashley Whillans \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s not our fault we\u2019ve ended up like this. Culturally, the inherent value of time has been suppressed. Society teaches us that we should hero-worship people who never leave the office. Moreover, rising income inequality makes us feel as if our world could collapse tomorrow if we don\u2019t spend every moment working, or at least appearing to work.

If you fulfill your end of the bargain, it\u2019s much easier to find positive outcomes when clients behave badly.\u201d\nHBR: Fallon\u2019s Chairman on Getting Clients to Take Creative Risks by Pat Fallon \u2014 \u201cAn idea that may seem risky during a presentation will look less so when it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve thought it through. The client realizes, \u2018These guys understand my business. They understand the flow of money. They are putting my success at the forefront of decisions.\u2019 That creates enough trust for the client to say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to hold my breath, hold my nose, and jump into the water with you.\u2019\u201d\nHBR: Negotiating with Clients You Can\u2019t Afford to Lose by Reed K. Holden \u2014 \u201cEvery supplier knows the drill: You identify your most valuable customers and classify them as \u2018strategic accounts.\u2019 You can\u2019t afford to lose them. Whatever they ask for, you deliver with your best team and best turnaround \u2014 even if it\u2019s unreasonable or unprofitable. The customers know they are a strategic account, so they\u2019ll try everything to wring out cost savings.\u201d\nHBR: Research: Are Clients Loyal to Your Firm, or the People in It? by Joe Raffiee \u2014 \u201cEmployee turnover can be a big challenge for companies. But it creates a unique problem for professional services firms, which have to worry about employees taking clients with them if they leave.\u201d",

But allowing yourself to be lulled into a false sense of security sets you up for shock and disappointment when you are fired or laid off.\u201d\nFirst Round Review: How to Lead and Rally a Company Through a Layoff \u2014 \u201cA layoff shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to leaders, nor to its people. It\u2019s not something that\u00a0happens\u00a0to a company. It\u2019s an act by its leadership when no other\u00a0routes can be pursued. In other words, when a layoff is your way forward, you should implicitly be telling people that you\u2019ve exhausted every other route.\u201d\nHBR: Firing Back: How Great Leaders Rebound After Career Disasters by Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld and Andrew J. Ward \u2014 \u201cNo one can truly define success and failure for us\u2014only we can define that for ourselves. No one can take away our dignity unless we surrender it. No one can take away our hope and pride unless we relinquish them. No one can steal our creativity, imagination, and skills unless we stop thinking. No one can stop us from rebounding unless we give up.\u201d\nHBR: After Layoffs, Help Survivors Be More Effective by Anthony J. Nyberg and\u00a0 Charlie O. Trevor \u2014 \u201cIf your firm has downsized recently, you\u2019re now managing a bunch of survivors\u2014the lucky ones who didn\u2019t get laid off.

Dan and Alison answer your questions with the help of Nicholas Pearce, an associate professor at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. They talk through how to transform a toxic culture, whether you\u2019re a junior employee, a manager, or in charge.\nFrom Alison and Dan\u2019s reading list:\nHBR: Recognizing Employees Is the Simplest Way to Improve Morale by David Novak \u2014 \u201cOne question I loved to ask is, \u2018What would you do if you had my job?\u2019 Maybe the response will be a useful suggestion, in which case you should acknowledge it and implement it if possible, to prove that these conversations aren\u2019t just for show. Even if you don\u2019t get any great ideas, such discussions can still have a huge impact, as long as your staff sees that you really thought about their suggestions.\u201d\nHBR: Changing Company Culture Requires a Movement, Not a Mandate by Bryan Walker and Sarah A. Soule \u2014 \u201cThe dominant culture and structure of today\u2019s organizations are perfectly designed to produce their current behaviors and outcomes, regardless of whether those outcomes are the ones you want. If your hope is for individuals to act differently, it helps to change their surrounding conditions to be more supportive of the new behaviors, particularly when they are antithetical to the dominant culture.\u201d\nHBR: Manage Your Emotional Culture by Sigal Barsade and Olivia A. O\u2019Neill \u2014 \u201cIn our interviews with executives and employees, some people have told us that their organizations lack emotion altogether. But every organization has an emotional culture, even if it\u2019s one of suppression. By not only allowing emotions into the workplace, but also understanding and consciously shaping them, leaders can better motivate their employees.\u201d\nHBR: The Leader\u2019s Guide to Corporate Culture by Boris Groysberg, Jeremiah Lee, Jesse Price, and J. Yo-Jud Cheng \u2014 \u201cMuch like defining a new strategy, creating a new culture should begin with an analysis of the current one, using a framework that can be openly discussed throughout the organization. Leaders must understand what outcomes the culture produces and how it does or doesn\u2019t align with current and anticipated market and business conditions.\u201d",
