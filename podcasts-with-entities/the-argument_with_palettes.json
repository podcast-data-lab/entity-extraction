Yet the results of last week\u2019s midterms and the red wave that wasn\u2019t signaled that perhaps Trump\u2019s hold on the Republican Party isn\u2019t so strong after all.

Yang is a former Democratic candidate for president and a former Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City. Jolly is a former Republican congressman and executive chairman of the Serve America Movement. Together, they joined Jane Coaston live onstage at the Texas Tribune Festival to discuss why they\u2019ve built a party and not a nonprofit, what kinds of candidates they want to see run under their banner and what Democrats are getting wrong in their midterm strategy right now.\n(A full transcript of the episode will be available midday on the Times website.)",

From \u201cStop the Steal\u201d to the storming of the U.S. Capitol and now, the overturn of Roe v. Wade \u2014 Christian nationalist rhetoric has undergirded it all. But given that a majority of Americans identify as Christian, faith also isn\u2019t going anywhere in our politics. So what would a better relationship between church and state look like?</p><p>To discuss, Jane Coaston brings together two people who are at the heart of the Christian nationalism debate. Katherine Stewart is the author of \u201cThe Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism\u201d and has reported on the Christian right for over a decade. Esau McCaulley is a contributing writer for Times Opinion and theologian-in-residence at Progressive Baptist Church in Chicago.</p><p>Stewart feels that the movement is paving the way to something with graver consequence. \u201cThis is a movement that wants to promote theocratic policies,\u201d she says. \u201cBut theocracy is really not the end point. It\u2019s sort of a means to an end, which is authoritarianism.\u201d McCaulley agrees the danger is real.

According to a new New York Times/Siena College poll, 33 percent of Democrats who want a different candidate for president in 2024 pointed to Joe Biden\u2019s age as a motivating factor.

She is joined two conservative writers, David French and Christopher Caldwell.\n\nFrench is a senior editor of \u201cThe Dispatch\u201d and a contributing writer at The Atlantic. Caldwell is a contributing writer for New York Times Opinion. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone disputes that there\u2019s a wide open lane for populist incitement,\u201d French says. \u201cI think the issue with J.D. Vance and the issue with the Republican Party in general is this move that says, we\u2019re going to indulge it. We\u2019re going to stoke it.\u201d"

Vindman was also a key witness at Donald Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial, having listened in on the notorious 2019 call in which Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Vindman says of the Western response to the invasion, \u201cWe need to drop these incremental approaches that are intended for a kind of peacetime environment,\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019re in a new Cold War.\u201d\n\nWhat is your take on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine?

In the coming year, the court will examine whether it\u2019s lawful for college admissions offices to consider a student\u2019s race.\n\nThese cases and others have brought into focus the role affirmative action plays in higher education, and whether it helps or impedes the overall goal of achieving racial equity on college campuses.\n\nSo the question Jane debates this week is: Should we end affirmative action?\n\nOn today\u2019s episode, the Opinion writer Jay Caspian Kang sets the stage by sharing with Jane his view that affirmative action policies merely make for \u201ccosmetically diverse\u201d campuses, rather than contributing to broader social justice initiatives.\n\nJay and Jane\u2019s conversation is followed by a debate between two guests with starkly different views. Ian Rowe, the former chief executive of Public Prep, a nonprofit charter school network, believes that race-based affirmative action needs to be retired in favor of class-based solutions. Natasha Warikoo, a professor of sociology at Tufts University, believes affirmative action is worth saving, and we should find ways to reframe it.\n\nWhat is your take on affirmative action: end it, or keep it? We want to hear from you. Share your thoughts in the comments on this page once you\u2019ve listened to the debate.\n"

But what about the voices from the middle, the independents? Swing voters are arguably one of the most consequential groups for the midterm elections, so we wanted to hear from them about how they view President Biden\u2019s first year and the current state of American democracy.</p><p>So this month the veteran G.O.P pollster Frank Luntz convened <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/opinion/biden-independent-voters.html\" target=\"_blank\">a focus group of 14 self-identified independents and moderates</a> to get their perspectives. And there seems to be a striking theme: They\u2019re exasperated.

People were eager to draw direct connections between the arguments used in court and the inequities that are seen in the country on a daily basis.</p><p>But is looking at the Rittenhouse trial and other high-profile cases really the best way to understand where we are as a nation?</p><p>This is a question that Sherrilyn Ifill has had to contend with during the nearly 10 years she\u2019s led the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Ifill oversaw the LDF as they sued the Trump administration and as the battle over voting rights has escalated over the past four years.</p><p>Jane and Ifill discuss how the LDF has navigated the role of practicing law while advocating political movements in the country.

And overseas, Britain\u2019s competition regulator has already directed Meta to sell one of its companies, the gif-sharing platform Giphy.\n\nMeta reaches 3.6 billion monthly active users across platforms, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook itself. Amid a growing techlash, how to fix Meta is a big question.\n\nIn today\u2019s episode, Jane Coaston explores two opposing views on whether breaking up the company might help. Sarah Miller, the director of the American Economic Liberties Project, argues Meta engaged in anticompetitive practices by buying its rivals. And Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, is a champion of big business who lauds Meta as an \u201cantimonopoly\u201d engine.\n\n(A full transcript of the episode will be available midday on the Times website.)"

But this Sunday, we\u2019ll be back to Standard Time. Which is nice for bright mornings. But it means it\u2019s dark before dinner. The clock change is cumbersome and confusing, and only about <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/24473/countries-changing-clock-daylight-savings/\" target=\"_blank\">70 countries</a> in the world follow it. Even in the United States there\u2019s no cohesion around Daylight Time; Arizona and Hawaii don\u2019t make the switch.</p><p>And it\u2019s something politicians of all parties can agree on.

                "summary": "More than 19 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus and upward of 665 million vaccine doses have been administered worldwide. As these numbers continue to rise, countries have begun issuing or considering \u201cvaccine passports.\u201d\n\nVaccine passports \u2014 proof through a phone app or on a piece of paper that you\u2019ve had your shots \u2014 are a potential ticket to freedom for millions of vaccinated people around the world. Israel already has them. The European Union and China have also announced a version of them. In the United States, there\u2019s talk about what such a certification might look like.\n\nBut vaccine passports also raise huge ethical questions, with 85 percent of shots worldwide having been administered in wealthier countries. And with private tech companies working on creating these passports in the United States, there\u2019s worry about the risks of sharing health records with third-party apps. Both Texas and Florida have prohibited government-mandated vaccine passports.\n\nOn today\u2019s episode, our guests debate the concept of a vaccine passport and discuss the ethical and privacy considerations that come along with them.

What counts as a cancellation? Who gets to decide?</p><p>On today\u2019s episode, we argue over what being canceled means and if it\u2019s time to get rid of the idea entirely.

You'll also get a daily bonus episode of the board's deliberations after the candidate leaves the room, and go deeper into a different key issue in the 2020 race. In our series finale, you'll hear the board debate all the candidates and make their final decision. Host Katie Kingsbury will join the columnists on \"The Argument\" next Thursday to make the case for the candidate the board endorses. Until then, tune in to \"The Choice\" to help you make your own.
