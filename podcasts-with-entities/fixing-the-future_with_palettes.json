The sign said, \u201cRebranding, to serve you better.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re a bit guilty of that here at Spectrum. This is the 30th episode of IEEE Spectrum\u2019s relaunched podcast series, but the first under a new name, \u201cFixing the Future.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve changed the name partly for marketing and searchability reasons. But it also signals our intention to focus more intently on ways that technology is being deployed to improve our lives, specifically in three\u2014to be sure overlapping\u2014areas: climate change; machine learning and other smart technologies; and the effects of automation on the nature of work and the future of jobs.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m hard-pressed to imagine a more on-point guest to help me usher in this change than Myriam Sbeiti. She\u2019s the CEO and co-founder of Sunthetics, a startup that\u2019s reinventing the industrial processes by which we make nylon by replacing a thermal operation with an electrical one, and has both grown that business and pivoted toward other industrial processes as well. \nFixing the Future is sponsored by COMSOL, makers of mathematical modeling software and a longtime supporter of IEEE Spectrum as a way to connect and communicate with engineers.",

In three-quarters of the state-level elections, the winning margin was more than 20 percentage points\u2014in other words, landslides\u2014even though statewide, the margins between the two main political parties is razor-thin\u2014at the presidential level, Trump beat Biden by less than 2 percent, and a Democrat won the 2020 governor\u2019s race. That\u2019s gerrymandering, the process by which a state is divided up in such a way as to maximize the number of electoral seats one particular party is likely to win.\nThere are two ways to gerrymander. In one, you concentrate your opposition\u2019s likely voters into a single district, giving that one away but winning all or most of the surrounding areas. In the other, you divide a concentration of likely voters into two or more districts in such a way that they\u2019ll fall short of a majority.\nGerrymandering is obviously unfair, but creating fair districts is harder than it looks. So political operatives and consultants draw up various maps, maximizing this or that, but mostly their party\u2019s interests.\nIf this seems instead like a job for computer-aided statistical analysis, it is. Several years ago, researchers in North Carolina got the idea of generating thousands\u2014even tens of thousands\u2014of maps, and creating algorithms that maximize the desired variables to the extent possible.\nJonathan Mattingly is a Professor of Statistical Science, and a Professor of Mathematics at Duke University He leads a group at Duke that conducts non-partisan research to understand and quantify gerrymandering.\nA @RadioSpectrum1 conversation with Duke University Professor of Mathematics Jonathan Mattingly.

            "contentSnippet": "The Federal Communications Commission's very first cellular spectrum allocation was a messy affair. The U.S. was divided up into 120 cellular markets, with two licenses each, and in some cases, hundreds of bidders. By 1984, the FCC had switched over to a lottery system. Unsurprisingly, people gamed the system. The barriers to enter the lottery were low, and many of the 37,000 applications\u2014yes, 37,000 applications\u2014simply wanted to flip the spectrum for a profit if they won.\nThe FCC would soon move to an auction system. Overnight, the barrier to entry went from very low to very high. One observer noted that these auctions were not \u201cfor the weak of heart or those with shallow pockets.\u201d\nCellular adoption grew at a pace no one could anticipate.

By one estimate, a billion people still do without it. Even in a modern city like Mumbai, generators are commonplace, because of an uncertain electrical grid. This year, California once again saw rolling blackouts, and with our contemporary climate producing heat waves that can stretch from the Pacific Coast to the Rocky Mountains, they won\u2019t be the last.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nElectricity is hard to store and hard to move, and electrical grids are complex, creaky, and expensive to change. In the early 20teens, Europe began merging its distinct grids into a continent-wide supergrid, an algorithm-based project that IEEE Spectrum wrote about in 2014. The need for a continent-wide supergrid in the U.S. has been almost as great, and by 2018 the planning of one was pretty far long\u2014until it hit a roadblock that, two years later, still stymies any progress. The problem is not the technology, and not even the cost. The problem is political. That\u2019s the conclusion of an extensively reported investigation jointly conducted by The Atlantic magazine and InvestigateWest, a watchdog nonprofit that was founded in 2009 after the one of Seattle\u2019s daily newspapers stopped publishing. The resulting article, with the heading, \u201cWho Killed the Supergrid?\u201d, was written by Peter Fairley, who has been a longtime contributing editor for IEEE Spectrum.",
