Nikesh came over, before a kids birthday party, for a spot of Lennie\u2019s ultimate\u2026.vegan cuisine. Whilst eating a stew, we talked about his mum\u2019s fabulous Gujarati food and her famous yellow Dahl, falling in love, bleaching his hair at school, Eminem and everything else in between. And now we all need to go to Kensal Green for Malaysian food. It was a pretty gorgeous Sunday afternoon. Thanks for coming down to hang out Nikesh.

Mum didn't get to be in the episode we recorded in LA years ago so it felt only right to chat to Benny again! He talks about his new album Friends Keep Secrets 2, working with Gracie Abrams, his 2 cooking shows about eating (hence why Ben and I get on so well) and being the king of slow cooked meat. We manage to finish off his last supper meal (last time I think the devils lettuce may have interfered with that) and you all get to hear his greatest hit yet, the ambient pioneering sound of Benny weeing whilst talking to us on zoom.&nbsp;Enjoy!

Straight out of A&amp;E and onto the podcast, Joe chatted to us about his lockdown routine, his newly appointed teaching assistant (his wife!), his gin collection, nothing beating a burger and chips, his brand new book \u2018Wean In 15\u2019 &amp; we discuss our shared mutual respect for the Moana soundtrack. And I reinvent the pronunciation of Quarantine as I've obviously been having too many Quarantinis !!!!&nbsp;To top it all off, he even serenaded us with his guitar! This is a good one, enjoy!
