And when the fall deepened and the leaves fell, it seemed to be extending some sort of goodness toward me. Like notes scattered at its roots asking me to pay attention. Each large and many-colored leaf was like a new contract with possibility. A small doorway where I might enter the world again. Enter the world through attention.</p>\n<p>To me, that is what poetry does. It offers no advice, no breaking news, no wisdom, no \u201cand the moral of the story.\u201d Instead, it offers connection and reciprocity. The inner and outer world colliding for one brief instant so that it\u2019s not about having answers, being right or being wrong, but recommitting ourselves again to the mystery, silence, and awe of the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope The Slowdown can be that type of unexpected goodness for its listeners.

At dinner she alone\nwill spoon out their eyes with her fingers,\n\nsuck down each pair as we watch. <em>See, this is why the three of you\ncould never hide anything from me</em>\u2014as though these organs\nbrought her sight to be soaked through the tongue.\nWhen I tell her that I have tried to make this stew from memory,\n\nshe warns, <em>Don\u2019t waste what should be eaten. </em>Reminds me\nof every delicate gift we have thrown away: tilapia stomach\nbest soured with vinegar, milkfish liver to melt\nagainst the dome of the mouth. That after church,\n\na bucket of chicken soon became a blessing of wing gristle\nand skin, dark meat no one else wanted to save.

Grandmother\n\t\tshrugs and repeats the same\n\nconclusion. Never have children, she says, \n\tthough her expression is hidden \n\t\tby the steam now rising from the pot.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple recipe: boil until the meat\n\tfalls from the bones, easy, like a girl\n\t\tshedding a summer dress.\n\nLast night, I cooked for friends.\n\tAfter dinner, my friend handed me \n\t\this one-month son, who only\n\nblinked when I nudged my thumb\n\tinto his fist. Earlier, washing the pale\n\t\tbird, I struggled to keep the body\n\nfrom slipping through my hands: I held\n           its small-fleshed form under cold water,\n\t\t      pulled the giblets out the round hollow\n\nbetween its ribs and was surprised\n\tto be surprised when it didn\u2019t\n\t\tmake a sound. \n\"Lesson: Chicken Soup\" by Christine Kitano, from SKY COUNTRY by Christine Kitano, copyright \u00a9 2017 Christine Kitano.
