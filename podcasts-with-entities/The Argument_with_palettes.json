It\u2019s become what the Times reporters Adam Satariano and Sheera Frenkel <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/technology/ukraine-russia-social-media.html\" target=\"_blank\">described</a> as a \u201cdefining geopolitical moment for some of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies.\u201d Spotify decided last Friday to suspend its services in Russia because of recently enacted Russian legislation that restricts access to news. Apple Pay also suspended services for Russia\u2019s Mir cards, the country\u2019s largest card payment system.</p><p>It\u2019s clear Big Tech companies hold big power. But should they?

Are they simply the anti-Trump party? Or are they the party of progress? Who are the voters they need to turn out in November? Should they excite the base by building a coalition united against white supremacy, or should they moderate their message to win over Republican-defectors?</p><p>This week on \u201cThe Argument,\u201d Jane Coaston brings together two voices that represent the factions in the Democratic Party\u2019s existential struggle. Lanae Erickson is the senior vice president of social policy, education and politics at the center-left think tank <a href=\"https://www.thirdway.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Third Way</a>. She argues that Democrats need to make their platform as broadly popular as possible in order to bring more voters under the party\u2019s big tent. That\u2019s the way to win, and <i>then</i> enact progressive policies.</p><p>Steve Phillips disagrees. He\u2019s the founder of the political media organization <a href=\"https://democracyincolor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Democracy in Color</a> and author of the book \u201cBrown Is the New White: How the Demographic Revolution Has Created a New American Majority.\u201d He counterargues that the Democrats must run and win as the party united around a vision of a multiracial, just society, unapologetically calling out racism on the other side of the ticket.<br /><br />The two political strategists strongly disagree on what the party needs to do to win in November, but they agree on one thing: Democrats are afraid and need to answer the question of who they are, fast.</p><p><strong>Mentioned in this episode:</strong></p><ul><li>\u201cThe Argument\u201d episode debating the future of the Republican Party: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/opinion/gop-trump-big-lie.html\" target=\"_blank\">Can the G.O.P.

But which side is ultimately the future of the party?</p><p>That\u2019s the question Jane Coaston poses to Charlie Sykes, a founder and editor at large of The Bulwark, and Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review.</p><p>Sykes and Lowry discuss what the G.O.P. has learned from Donald Trump\u2019s tenure as president and what Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial victory in Virginia might mean for the Republican midterms playbook. They also debate whether it\u2019s Representative Liz Cheney or Marjorie Taylor Greene who\u2019s a harbinger of the party to come.</p><p>Also, if you\u2019re a Republican, we want to hear from you. What do you think of the party right now and where it should go next? Would you be excited to vote for Trump in 2024? Or if you\u2019re a former Republican, why did you leave the party? And who would you rather vote for instead?

                "summary": "Last month, Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted on all charges related to the shooting of two people at a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wisc. Before, during and after the trial, journalists and pundits broke down the most sensational moments on the stand, and many tried to discern what Rittenhouse\u2019s not-guilty decision meant about the country at large. People were eager to draw direct connections between the arguments used in court and the inequities that are seen in the country on a daily basis.\n\nBut is looking at the Rittenhouse trial and other high-profile cases really the best way to understand where we are as a nation?\n\nThis is a question that Sherrilyn Ifill has had to contend with during the nearly 10 years she\u2019s led the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Ifill oversaw the LDF as they sued the Trump administration and as the battle over voting rights has escalated over the past four years.\n\nJane and Ifill discuss how the LDF has navigated the role of practicing law while advocating political movements in the country.

                "summary": "On Nov. 7, most of us will fall back an hour and restart the decades-old discussion of why we shift time twice a year.\n\nA quick reminder: In spring, we \u201cspring forward\u201d to Daylight Time, giving us daylight well into the evening. But this Sunday, we\u2019ll be back to Standard Time. Which is nice for bright mornings. But it means it\u2019s dark before dinner. The clock change is cumbersome and confusing, and only about 70 countries in the world follow it. Even in the United States there\u2019s no cohesion around Daylight Time; Arizona and Hawaii don\u2019t make the switch.\n\nAnd it\u2019s something politicians of all parties can agree on.

                "summary": "Whether it\u2019s Mr. Potato Head, Dr. Seuss or Roseanne, allegations of cancel culture seem to have a regular spot among the trending topics of the internet. Almost every other week, someone\u2019s cancellation becomes the subject of prominent discussion on Twitter, Substack and cable news. Yet its exact meaning is up for debate. What counts as a cancellation? Who gets to decide?\n\nOn today\u2019s episode, we argue over what being canceled means and if it\u2019s time to get rid of the idea entirely. Robby Soave, a senior editor for Reason, has been sounding the alarm about cancel culture. And he wrote a piece about our other guest, Will Wilkinson, titled \u201cCancel Culture Comes for Will Wilkinson.\u201d Wilkinson was arguably canceled after he wrote a tweet that led to his firing from the Niskanen Center, where he was the vice president for research. But he thinks the label of cancel culture is misleading, even when it\u2019s used in his defense.\n\nReferenced in this episode:\n\nRead Will Wilkinson\u2019s \u201cUndefined Cancel Game\u201d at his Substack.\nRobby Soave in Reason: \u201cCancel Culture Comes for Will Wilkinson\u201d\n\nShare your arguments with us: We want to hear what you\u2019re arguing about with your family, your friends and your frenemies.

Ross asks Michelle if she\u2019d concede that court packing would be a significant escalation in the \u201cjudicial wars,\u201d and Michelle asks Ross what happens to the anti-choice movement if and when Roe is overturned.\n\nThen, the hosts listen to the show\u2019s voice mails and dig into the inbox to answer some listener questions. They respond to your questions about the open Supreme Court seat, who the heck is still undecided, Republicanism\u2019s evolution to Trumpism, and whether \u201cWAP\u201d is a feminist anthem. Finally, both hosts suggest you dive into the Nxivm cult\u2019s backstory through HBO\u2019s new documentary series, \u201cThe Vow.\u201d\n\nFor background reading on this episode, visit nytimes.com/theargument."
