    "description": "A History of Coffee is the story of how a tiny psychoactive seed changed the world and shapes our lives today. <br /><br />Across six episodes, documentary maker James Harper and professional historian Jonathan Morris narrate how humans race coffee across oceans to keep up with demand for this addictive drink. <br /><br />Coffee creates enormous fortunes for some, and misery for others. Sometimes the environment benefits, but more often it is plundered. <br /><br />If we want to make coffee a more equitable industry that\u2019s also kinder to the environment, a place to start is understanding the stories and systems that put the coffee into your cup this morning. <br /><br />Press the Subscribe button so you don\u2019t miss future episodes!<br /><br />Follow Jonathan Morris @coffeehistoryjm and James Harper @filterstoriespodcast. <br /><br />Read full transcripts at <a href=\"http://www.historyofcoffee.org\" rel=\"noopener\">www.historyofcoffee.org</a>.",
