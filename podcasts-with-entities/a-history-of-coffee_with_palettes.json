    "description": "A History of Coffee is the story of how a tiny psychoactive seed changed the world and shapes our lives today. <br /><br />Across six episodes, documentary maker James Harper and professional historian Jonathan Morris narrate how humans race coffee across oceans to keep up with demand for this addictive drink. <br /><br />Coffee creates enormous fortunes for some, and misery for others. Sometimes the environment benefits, but more often it is plundered. <br /><br />If we want to make coffee a more equitable industry that\u2019s also kinder to the environment, a place to start is understanding the stories and systems that put the coffee into your cup this morning. <br /><br />Press the Subscribe button so you don\u2019t miss future episodes!<br /><br />Follow Jonathan Morris @coffeehistoryjm and James Harper @filterstoriespodcast. <br /><br />Read full transcripts at <a href=\"http://www.historyofcoffee.org\" rel=\"noopener\">www.historyofcoffee.org</a>.",

But it\u2019s basically impossible to find, and we\u2019re going to bet you\u2019ve never drank it. <br /><br />But that's really odd, because Sri Lanka has the perfect climate to grow coffee, and was once one of the biggest coffee growing countries in the world. <br /><br />But Sri Lanka was the victim of an ecological ticking time bomb. And this bomb is still ticking, and is going to explode again. <br /><br />In this episode of Adventures in Coffee, producer James Harper takes co-hosts Scott and Jools on an adventure back in time, across Ethiopia, Yemen, Sri Lanka to trace the origins of this ticking bomb, and what it\u2019s going to take to defuse it. <br /><br />\u2014<br /><br />Subscribe to Adventures in Coffee here: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/300V4jS\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/300V4jS</a><br /><br />Listen to Jonathan's guest appearance on negative coffee advertising here: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uOXYc0\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3uOXYc0</a><br /><br />Read Stuart McCook\u2019s excellent book, Coffee Is Not Forever: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3320rob\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3320rob</a><br /><br />Listen to James\u2019 stories about El Salvador on his Filter Stories channel: <a href=\"https://spoti.fi/3Lcnuhg\" rel=\"noopener\">https://spoti.fi/3Lcnuhg</a> <br /><br />Help other people find the show by leaving a rating on Spotify: <a href=\"https://spoti.fi/3JYduHY\" rel=\"noopener\">https://spoti.fi/3JYduHY</a> <br /><br />Help others find the show by creating a screengrab of this episode on your podcast player and sharing it on your Instagram stories.
