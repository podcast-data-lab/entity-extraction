She's in the news all the time now when hackers make headlines and she's done some of my favorite work on Anonymous and Internet culture.<br />\nGabriella Coleman began her academic career in the Bay Area, researching the Free Software movement. This research is the basis of her book Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking. <br />\nGabriella showed up on the scene,  just around the time the Free Software movement was rebranding itself as \"Open Source.\" It turns out that there are too many meanings of the word free in the English language: free beer... free speech... But when the government started using the DMCA to crack down on coding, Hackers bonded together around a very specific definition of the word. <br />\nThis installment marks the first appearance of someone I have been recording for years: my friend \"Chris\" He is always up to something amazing, but I am always suspicious that he may be pulling my ear-leg. This time he gives us the \"truth\" about the alleged hack of the New York Times by the Chinese. <br />\nAlso,  your host wonders if it might be possible to hire a hacker to break into George RR Martin's computer so that he can read the rest of the Game of Thrones story without having to wait 10 years like everyone else.\n      "

                "summary": "\n        The torture scenes in Zero Dark Thirty were extremely controversial. Supposedly, they even cost the film an Oscar, Argo, the CIA\u2019s other propaganda effort for 2012, trounced ZDT at the Academy Awards. <br />\nThere is no factual evidence that connects any intelligence gleaned from torture with the successful operation that took out Osama Bin Laden but this movie uses the magic of Hollywood to cement the two together forever. Recently I decided to watch these torture scenes with Joshua Phillips, a journalist who spent years researching the effects of torture on detainees and interrogators. He is the author of None of Us Were Like this Before: American Soldiers and Torture.  At Joshua's apartment we recorded a torture commentary track for our imaginary Criterion edition of the film. <br />\nWe will probably never learn the truth about how we found Osama Bin Laden. But there is one thing I know for certain. We didn\u2019t get the information from Umarov Muhibullah.<br />\nJournalist McKenzie Funk ran into Umarov, one of the first men to be released from Guantanamo, while hiking in Tajikistan. Umarov told Mackenzie that the US held him for two years before letting him go. He was never told why we had been detained nor was he compensated in any fashion.  This was a scoop, but Mackenzie was young and he couldn\u2019t get any major media interested in the story. It did run in  Mother Jones. In 2010 Wikileaks released a number of Guantanamo related files, including documents that attested to the innocence of Umarov and others.  <br />\nMackenzie and I put this story together two years ago. The week US forces killed Osama Bin Laden. For a brief second I thought this might be when we come to our senses and close Guantanamo once and for all. But it is still open. Today 100 inamates are on hunger strike. I believe they have finally learned the truth about Guantanamo: it will never close.\n      "

They have been studying the connections between the digital and the material for years in their museum shows, design work and collaborative projects.<br />\nI spoke with them about their essay \u201cCaptives of the Clouds\u201d serialized in the journal e-flux.. They use the story of Wikileaks to expose the infrastructure of the cloud. I now believe November 30th, 2010 just might be the actual birthday of the cloud, a day almost in the middle of our Bieber timeline (from episode one) <br />\nThe BBC's Paul Mason has done some serious reporting on Rare Earth but he told me that on the last night of a trip he made in late 2009 he realized he would have a much easier time getting the story right in a novel. I read a lot about Rare Earth for this radio series and this novel was by far the most enlightening (and the most fun). <br />\nOn my last night in China I met up with an old friend who used to run a Chinese blog business. In 2007 he came through New York and told me he was determined to do something tangible, something more real. Now he uses the cloud to power his very successful online mail order business that connects customers with Chinese factories. He takes me to a bar (very much like one described in Paul Mason's novel) where I finally get some... clarity? All thanks to a pile of iPhones.\n      "

                "summary": "\n        In many ways the cloud is just another Internet Buzz Word: Interactive, Web 2.0, Social Media, the cloud. But we now spend most of our time living and working in the cloud, and most of us have no idea how it works, what it does, what's different, or what it all means. This was really bringing me down. So I decided to make a radio show. <br />\nWe start off with Britt Selvitelle (Twitter employee #7).  He tells us what happened when Justin Bieber joined Twitter in 2009 and how everything had changed by the time the Bieb joined Instagram in 2011. What makes these two stories different is that the popular photo sharing application instagram built its platform using Amazon Web Services, the cloud.  Matt Wood, Amazon\u2019s principal data scientist, explains how individuals and businesses are using the cloud and how it is changing our relationship with technology.<br />\nAmazon officially launched its product in 2006, but at some date in between these two events,  the cloud comes into its own. The exact date doesn't actually matter - what's important  is that most of us, including technologists like Britt Selvitelle, didn't even notice.<br />\n Harper Reed, was the CTO for Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign, and he is one of the smartest technologists I know. <br />\nHe tells me how the campaign used Amazon Web Services and why Cloud infrastructure is awesome.<br />\nI recently saw a Cloud Ad on the subway.  It wasn't an Ad for Amazon but one of their competitors, it was kind of like the one above. It was a picture of a man climbing up a mountain with his bare hands, this man didn't have a shirt on, and you could tell he worked out at an expensive gym, perhaps with a personal trainer. There was an ipad or a tablet tucked into the back of his shorts, apparently he was so good at climbing - he didn't have to worry about it falling out. In the sky written in big white fluffy letters was a sentence that read: Experience the mobility and freedom of working in the cloud. There is a lot of Hype about the cloud, the recruitment Ads for cloud companies are just as nutty as the cloud product Ads. <br />\nI went to San Francisco to talk to someone who works in the Cloud. I found Charity Majors  <br />\nCharity works at Parse. Parse is a Back-end-as-a-Service company. <br />\nBut as hard as I tried, I could not get into the cloud itself.\n      "
