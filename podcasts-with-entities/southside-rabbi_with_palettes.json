This is Part 2 of our series engaging CRT to the glory of God, featuring our brother Bradly Mason, who has actually spoken with and studied several of the founders of CRT, and will prayerfully bring some clarity to this big mess of a \"culture war\" out here in the streets. Here we discuss much about Voddie Baucham's recent book 'Fault Lines', as well as the many misconceptions equating those thinking and talking about 'social holiness', with walking away from faith in Christ. Bradly also shares an exclusive story about how Ameen helped shape his own change of heart towards these issues years ago! Buckle up!"
