It\u2019s Violet\u2019s scene with Brian, Kari\u2019s current boyfriend, Violet\u2019s ex. Violet was Brian\u2019s big love and Kari is nothing like her.",

            "contentSnippet": "It\u2019s fun to try to be beautiful when people are giving you positive attention for it. It hurts if you\u2019re not meeting that standard and people treat you like you aren\u2019t even there. You watch the people who are getting a lot of positive attention for being that certain kind of beautiful and you are made to feel invisible.\nOr worse, people go out of their way to make you feel bad.\nIt\u2019s hard to be a woman, yes. It\u2019s a lot harder to be a woman who\u2019s hairier, wider, bigger, taller, square instead of round, straight up and down instead of curvy, big hands, big feet, no vagina and maybe no breasts either. A woman who isn\u2019t quite looking like what some people think a woman should look like. But who is finding her way.\nTo these women, the world can be downright cruel. More than cruel, violent. Harassment often escalates into assault, and more often than you would like to hear, escalates into full on homicide.\nFor these women, being womanly in the way we are told we have to is sometimes about more than beauty.
