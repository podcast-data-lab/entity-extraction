    "description": "The 11th is a podcast that publishes an entirely new issue on the 11th of every month. Inspired by the experience of opening a magazine you love every month and not knowing exactly what you will get, but trusting that something engaging and true will be there waiting for you. Many stories aren\u2019t meant to be a 10-part series and don\u2019t fit the format of a weekly show. The 11th is a home for those in-between ideas. Made up of reported series and personal journeys, fiction and musicals, deep investigative journalism and intimate conversations. Each issue, a different voice. Every month, something new.",

Writers Resham Mantri and Carvell Wallace let us in on the most intimate details of their long distance relationship as they figure out how they want to love and be loved. Through a collage of essays, audio diaries, and interviews the two share their approach to practicing love: deliberately. No promises of forever, no promises of monogamy, but an openness to discover new ways to love, new ways to connect.

Many stories aren\u2019t meant to be a 10-part series and don\u2019t fit the format of a weekly show. The 11th is a home for those in-between ideas. Made up of reported series and personal journeys, fiction and musicals, deep investigative journalism and intimate conversations. Each issue, a different voice. Every month, something new."
