Joining Chris and Lauren will be this week&rsquo;s top trending guest(s) - maybe a talked-about player from&nbsp;<em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Love is Blind Season 2</em> or even some fan-faves from&nbsp;<em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Too Hot To Handle</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Must-see-TV is taken to the next level through prompts, games, conversations, segments, and immersive audience engagement that foster unpredictable moments and shocking reveals.
