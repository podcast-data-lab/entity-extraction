But on More or Less we still keep an eye on them because that\u2019s how we roll.\n\nA recent article estimated that 129 billion single-use face masks are used every day around the world. It sounds wrong, but how wrong is it? And how did it get so wrong?\n\nMaking up the shortfall from the \u00a320 weekly cut in the universal credit benefit means working an extra two hours a week - or an extra nine, depending on who you listen to. We run the numbers.\n\nPlus, has the number of periods women have in a lifetime increased fourfold? And how many holes does a drinking straw have?"

But one US stat seemed particularly stark: the number of young men having no sex at all in the past year has tripled in a decade. But is it true? \n\nNo coal power for a week\nThere were many reports in the newspapers this week saying the UK has set a new record for the number of consecutive days generating energy without burning any coal. So where is our electricity coming from? \n\nMissing people\nSome listeners got in touch to say they were surprised to hear that a person is reported missing in the UK every 90 seconds. Dr Karen Shalev Greene of the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons joins us to explore the numbers.\n\nIn Mice\nOne scientist is correcting headlines on Twitter by adding one key two-word caveat \u2013 the fact that the research cited has only been carried out \"in mice\". We ask him why he\u2019s doing it."

                "summary": "Was it a surprise that Easter Monday was so hot?\n\nA heatwave struck the UK over Easter \u2013 and in fact Easter Monday was declared the hottest on record in the UK. But listeners asked - is it that surprising that it was the warmest when the date fell so late in April? We crunch the numbers supplied by the Met Office.\n\nInsectageddon\n\nInsects live all around us and if a recent scientific review is anything to go by, then they are on the path to extinction. The analysis found that more than 40% of insect species are decreasing and that a decline rate of 2.5% a year suggests they could disappear in 100 years. And as some headlines in February warned of the catastrophic collapse of nature, some More or Less listeners questioned the findings. Is insect life really in trouble?\n\nCollecting income tax from the 1%\n\nRecently Lord Sugar said in a Tweet \u201cThe fact is if you taxed everyone earning over \u00a3150k at a rate of 70% it would not raise enough to pay for 5% of the NHS.\u201d Is that true? Helen Miller, Deputy Director and head of tax at the Institute for Fiscal Studies looks at how much such a policy might raise from the 1% of tax payers who earn over \u00a3150,000.\n\nWhere is Scotland\u2019s highest village?\n\nA battle is brewing in the Southern Scottish uplands between two rival villages. How can statistics help determine which village should take the crown? Wanlockhead and Leadhills both lay claim to the title of Scotland\u2019s highest village but there can only be one winner. More or Less attempts to settle the age old dispute once and for all.\n\nImage: A man and woman sitting on deckchairs on the beach\nCredit: Getty Images"
