    "description": "Award-winning broadcaster and educator Alvin Hall hits the road alongside activist and social justice trainer Jan\u00e9e Woods Weber. They drive from Detroit to New Orleans, collecting powerful, personal testimony about how Black Americans used the historic travel guide The Negro Motorist's Green Book during the height of segregation as a vital resource to quell fears, find safe havens, and travel with dignity. As he drives the Green Book, Alvin unearths both inspiring and heartbreaking tales that tell a different story from what Hollywood would have you believe. Driving the Green Book is a living history podcast that preserves a powerful legacy and honors the stories of those who lived through the era, supported and uplifted each other, and fought for equality. Please be sure to explore the Green Book on our exclusive Apple Maps Guide at apple.co/explorethegreenbook, listen to the show's Apple Music Playlist at apple.co/listentothegreenbook, and find recommended reading in Apple Books at apple.co/alvinhallcollection.",

They drive from Detroit to New Orleans, collecting powerful, personal testimony about how Black Americans used the historic travel guide The Negro Motorist's Green Book during the height of segregation as a vital resource to quell fears, find safe havens, and travel with dignity. As he drives the Green Book, Alvin unearths both inspiring and heartbreaking tales that tell a different story from what Hollywood would have you believe. Driving the Green Book is a living history podcast that preserves a powerful legacy and honors the stories of those who lived through the era, supported and uplifted each other, and fought for equality. Please be sure to explore the Green Book on our exclusive Apple Maps Guide at apple.co/explorethegreenbook, listen to the show's Apple Music Playlist at apple.co/listentothegreenbook, and find recommended reading in Apple Books at apple.co/alvinhallcollection."
