You\u2019ll hear from people who lived this story, experiencing the triumphs and losses of Mars Hill, knowing it as both an amazing, life-transforming work of God and as a dangerous, abusive environment. The issues that plague Mars Hill and its founder, Mark Driscoll \u2014 dangers like money, celebrity, youth, scandal, and power\u2014aren\u2019t unique, and only by looking closely at what happened in Seattle will we be able to see ourselves.",

Most of the church\u2019s founding members thought Christian contemporary music was too saccharine and polished for their tastes, and what evolved at Mars Hill reflected the gritty and dark sounds of the city around them. But like many other facets of the Mars Hill story, there was much behind the music. Often selected for their charisma and talent, Mars Hill bands found that few cared about the condition of their souls or the posture of their spirits.\u00a0\nChad Gardner became a worship leader later in the church\u2019s history, having grown up listening to the church\u2019s music. His eventual decision to leave would mean sacrificing community and intellectual property rights over his band\u2019s contributions to the ministry.

                "summary": "As success grew at Mars Hill, Mark Driscoll\u2019s ministry dreams expanded. With the advent of the multi-site church and advances in technology, a leader could move beyond the mundanity of local place and community to spread his message far afield, fulfilling his own great commission literally to the ends of the earth. With a talented team and generous budget at his fingertips, Mark dreamed big. 50,000 church members. A New York Times bestseller. The most prominent media distribution channel on the Internet.\nBut when you undermine the foundations of a church, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when the building comes tumbling down around you. When technology removes the limits to access, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when it also sings the alluring call of worldly success. When you call others to deep sacrifice for your own ambitions, you begin to count the bodies under the bus.\nIn this episode of The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill, host Mike Cosper explores Mars Hill\u2019s \u201cmission accomplished\u201d cultural moment when Mark shifted his gaze from Seattle to cities and success benchmarks beyond. With incisive journalism and compassionate engagement, Cosper paints the picture of a wounded church\u2014sheep dispersed and isolated by technology, expendable to the mission of a shepherd gone wayward. And he asks us to consider whether our adoption of gospel-amplifying tactics has clouded our vision of its good, true and beautiful message.\n\u201cThe Rise and Fall of Mars Hill\u201d is a production of Christianity Today\nExecutive Producer: Erik Petrik\nProduced, written, edited, and hosted by: Mike Cosper\nAdditional editing by Resonate Recordings and Matt Linder\nAssociate produced by Joy Beth Smith\nMusic, sound design, and mixing: Kate Siefker\nTheme song: \u201cSticks and Stones\u201d by King\u2019s Kaleidescope\nClosing song: \u201cThe Bridge\u201d by\u00a0Taylor Leonhardt\nGraphic Design: Bryan Todd\nSocial Media: Nicole Shanks\nEditorial consulting: Andrea Palpant Dilley, Online Managing Editor\nChristianity Today Editor in Chief: Timothy Dalrymple\nLearn more about your ad choices.

The book sold millions and made him, in Collin Hansen\u2019s terms, an \u201cevangelical boy wonder.\u201dAt 29 years old he became the lead pastor of a Maryland megachurch and a rising star in Sovereign Grace Ministries. But when that movement was torn apart by controversy, conflict, and accusations of a systemic cover-up of child abuse, he found himself reeling, unsure of his calling and convictions. He left ministry in 2015, and in 2019, announced that he no longer identified as a Christian.\nIn this bonus episode of The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill, we\u2019ll explore Josh\u2019s story as a contemporary of Mark Driscoll, someone who was his polar opposite in temperament, and who\u2019s struggles in ministry led to a divergent outcome. We\u2019ll talk about faith, doubt, and celebrity, and discuss how Christians might think about their own doubts and deconstruction, recognizing them as a normal part of the Christian life.\nSubscriptions to CT are one of the best ways to support this kind of journalism.
