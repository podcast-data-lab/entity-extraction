And while some artists are happy to jump into this new space, others have been surprised \u2014 or furious \u2014 to find that strangers beat them to owning and selling NFTs of their work. Just last week, several musical artists publicly complained after the website HitPiece temporarily listed NFTs for their songs or albums without the artists&#8217; permission. But does selling someone else&#8217;s art as an NFT break the law? Aram Sinnreich is a professor and chair of the communication studies division at American University. He said this gets into a gray area, at least when it comes to existing copyright law.</p>\n"

And Pak says without international standards, switching between brands or locations can be a headache.</p>\n<p>New Investors Week:\u00a0Your first donation to Marketplace goes\u00a0TWICE as far with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Investors Challenge Fund! <a href=\"https://support.marketplace.org/tech-sn\">Give Now</a>.</p>\n"
