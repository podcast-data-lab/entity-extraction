                "summary": "By 1981, Pakistani-born immigrant Tariq Mehmood had endured years of violent racism in Britain. When he heard that gangs of white skinheads \u2013 with a history of attacking Asians \u2013 were coming to his home in Bradford, Tariq and his neighbours took desperate measures to defend their community. Underpinning their actions was the principle, \u201cself-defence is no offence.\u201d Tariq would end up being arrested, charged with conspiracy to make explosives, and facing life imprisonment. What followed was the landmark legal case of the Bradford 12.\n\nHand on the Sun, the novel that Tariq wrote in prison over 40 years ago, has been re-released with a new update.\n\nPresenter: Mobeen Azhar\nProducers: Maryam Maruf and Lina Chang\nEditor: Munazza Khan"

That moment would shape the rest of her life. These men, acting at the invitation of the Danish colonial government were rounding up the brightest Inuit children and sending them to live in Denmark to be re-educated as model Danish citizens or \u2018little Danes\u2019. Helene suffered terribly from being separated from her mother and siblings and it would take her many decades to discover the horrible truth behind it all: she was part of an experiment. Of the 22 children that were taken, Helene is now one of the few survivors.\n\nPresenter: Mobeen Azhar\nProducer: Edgar Maddicott\nTranslator: Alette Rye Scales\nVoice: Julia Holden"

Born into an abusive household, her early days were difficult and it wasn't long before she and her sister Sonya were taken into care by social services. This was the 1970s, and there was a widespread policy of taking indigenous children and putting them up for adoption with white families, removing them from their culture in the process. Nakuset was adopted, her sister wasn't. It was a painful process for Nakuset, but her eventual reunion with Sonya as an adult helped her get in touch with her heritage. The two sisters became close, but sadly their respective childhood experiences had left them scarred, and the reunion didn't have a fairy-tale ending.\n\nPresenter: Jo Fidgen\nProducer: Harry Graham\nEditor Munazza Khan\n\nIf you've been affected by any of the issues relating to mental health in this programme, help is available at Befrienders.org or at bbc.co.uk/actionline."
