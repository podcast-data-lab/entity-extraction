But her part in this story hasn\u2019t been well documented. Our editor Kim Huang recounts how difficult it was to get details of her story. And Vahe Peroomian explains how important it is to get these histories told to inspire the next generation to take on moonshot projects."

But that\u2019s how Dr. Clarence Ellis started his career of invention\u2014which would ultimately lead to reimagining how we all worked with computers and each other. \n\nMartez Mott describes the \u201cMother of all Demos\u201d that would inspire a generation of builders. Gary Nutt recounts working with Dr. Clarence Ellis at Xerox PARC, and the atmosphere at the coveted research lab. Chengzheng Sun and Paul Curzon explain how Operational Transformation\u2014the project to which Dr. Ellis devoted so much time and effort\u2014laid the foundation for the collaborative tools many of us use every day. And Delilah DeMers shares how humble her father was, and how he loved teaching people that technology can be a force for good."

Season 4 features many of the devices he\u2019s designed, built, worked on, and been inspired by. But for Woz, what\u2019s most important isn\u2019t necessarily the devices he\u2019s created\u2014it\u2019s how he built them.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Woz recounts how his early tinkering led to a lifelong passion for engineering. He started learning about computers on a GE 225 in high school. Soon enough, he was designing improvements to computers he wanted to buy\u2014eventually defining his mantra for simplicity in design. That philosophy helped him finish the Apple I after seeing the Altair 8800 at the Homebrew Computer Club, and to create the floppy drive for the Apple II.
