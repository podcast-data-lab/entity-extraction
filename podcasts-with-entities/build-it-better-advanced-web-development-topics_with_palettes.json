This project spans both server-side and client-side development, showcasing their full-stack prowess.</p>\n<p>What's even more exciting is Netflix's transition to GraphQL, the industry-standard query language for APIs. This move not only streamlines their development process but also empowers clients to take charge of a part of the backend layer, making it more efficient and consistent.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges that come with adopting new technology like GraphQL, Jay believes it's the right choice for Netflix. It offers a standardized approach, aligning with industry best practices.

The podcast discusses the benefits of having a spec document for ensuring best practices and avoiding carrying over bad behavior when re-architecting. They also discuss how to avoid over-engineering and the importance of understanding the best approach for a particular project and using the right tools for the job.\nThe episode delves into what should be included in an architectural spec document, which may vary depending on the project, but could cover things like the project goals, requirements, constraints, high-level design, data modeling, and more.\nPanelTracy Lee- @ladyleet\u00a0Ben Lesh- @BenLesh\u00a0Jay Phelps- @_jayphelps\nBuild IT Better is presented by This Dot: https://www.thisdot.co/Follow This Dot Labs on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ThisDotLabsFollow This Dot Media on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ThisDotMedia"
