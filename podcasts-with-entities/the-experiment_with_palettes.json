                "summary": "<p><a href=\"http://www.ashleycford.net/\">Ashley C. Ford</a> was just a baby when her father was sentenced to 30 years behind bars. Prison phone calls\u2014a $1.4 billion industry in the United States\u2014were often prohibitively expensive for her family, so Ford maintained a fragmentary relationship with him through handwritten letters and short visits, while her loved ones tried to shield her from her father\u2019s past. With limited contact and unanswered questions, Ford filled in the blanks with fantasies of her father as the perfect man.

Freeman \u00a0 A piece of my flesh torn away. A piece of my bone broken off. A piece of my soul remade. A piece of my thought set free. \u00a0 In her thin hands the lines of time grow long. In her black eyes float the truths of stone tablets. Round her slender neck a dusky hair lies knotted. On her dark skin the map of fruit is drawn. \u00a0 She is a raindrop on my cheek, translucent as the future I can\u2019t see. \u00a0 She is a knot that need not to be untied like the formula my blood traced from the sky, an omen trickling from history. \u00a0 She kisses the stone on my grave that holds down my corpse and entrusts me to it. \u00a0 She is a luckless spell who made me a creator and carried on my creation. \u00a0 She is my daughter.",

                "summary": "<p>In June, the Supreme Court issued a narrow ruling on college sports: Student athletes will now be able to receive educational benefits such as free laptops and paid internships. The decision may have seemed relatively small, but in this episode of the<em> Experiment </em>podcast, the <em>Atlantic</em> staff writer Adam Harris explains how it could change the way we think about college athletes.</p>\n<p>College sports rake in billions of dollars a year for schools. But athletes themselves have historically been barred from making money by the NCAA in order to preserve their amateur status. \u201cAmateurism\u201d has long been a central idea of college athletics: Student athletes play for the love of the game and an education, never for compensation. The myth (and marketing) of the \u201cstudent athlete\u201d have grown over the past century, but starting in 2010, a scandal gradually shifted how the country saw college sports.</p>\n<p>This week on <em>The Experiment:</em> The <em>Atlantic</em> staff writer and former college-basketball player Adam Harris explains how the myth of the amateur athlete was created, and why it may finally be on its way out.</p>\n<p>This episode\u2019s guests include <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/adam-harris/\">Adam Harris</a>, a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arthomason?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Andy Thomason</a>, an assistant managing editor at <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> and the author of <a href=\"https://www.press.umich.edu/10171336/discredited\"><em>Discredited</em></a>; Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA football player and the executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.ncpanow.org/\">National College Players Association</a>; Mary Willingham, a former student-athlete academic adviser and whistleblower at the University of North Carolina.</p>\n<p><em>Further reading:</em> \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/10/the-shame-of-college-sports/308643/\">The Shame of College Sports</a>,\u201d by Taylor Branch</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/07/ncaa-supreme-court-ruling-student-athlete-exploitation/619571/\">A transcript of this episode is available.\u00a0</a></p>\n\n<p>Be part of <em>The Experiment</em>.

As a Black college student, he found a sense of belonging in Bible study. His mentors and community were predominantly white and very conservative, but that didn\u2019t really bother him. He found success as an artist and built a career in the white evangelical world.</p>\n<p>Over time, though, he began to notice how much politics influenced his church culture. He was inspired by Barack Obama\u2019s election, but felt unable to share that with his evangelical audiences. He was disturbed by the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, but faced backlash on social media for saying so. He started writing lyrics about race and the hypocrisy he saw among Christians, who he felt paid lip service to diversity but didn\u2019t form substantive relationships with other communities. When he saw how strongly the evangelical world was going to champion Donald Trump, he decided to speak out. He lost money and fans, friends and mentors. And he almost lost his faith.</p>\n<p>White evangelicals have arguably never been more powerful as a political force in America than they are now, but political victory has a human cost. People of all kinds of backgrounds have felt gutted by Christian support for Trump.

So, Julia, </span><em><span>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </span></em><span>is a wildly popular show on TLC. It\u2019s about couples who are international\u2014like, it\u2019s usually one person lives in America, and the other person lives somewhere overseas\u2014and I want to begin your </span><em><span>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </span></em><span>journey with one couple in particular: Colt and Larissa.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>Okay. I\u2019m gonna\u2014do I hit play?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Yes. Hit play!</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Colt: </em></strong><em><span>My name is Colt. I\u2019m 33 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>We are in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we\u2019re at the airport, and we\u2019re meeting Colt and Larissa. Colt is a white guy in his 30s. He lives in Las Vegas.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Larissa: </em></strong><em><span>I am Larissa, 31 years old, from Minas Gerais, Brazil.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>And Larissa is from Brazil. She is also in her 30s. And they met online. They went on vacation together\u2014to Cancun, I think\u2014and after five days of this vacation together, Colt asked Larissa to marry him. And so she said yes.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>After one date they decided to get married?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Yes, effectively one date. So what we\u2019re doing right now is that we\u2019re meeting Larissa for the first time. She\u2019s just flown into Las Vegas, and this scene is basically her first impressions.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>First impressions of Las Vegas, right?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Yes.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Larissa: </em></strong><em><span>Here is hot.\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Colt: </em></strong><em><span>I don\u2019t have air-conditioning.

[</span><em><span>Longoria chuckles.</span></em><span>] It\u2019s not the same sort of warmth in Brazil. I\u2019ve been to Brazil; I know the difference between desert heat and beach heat, [</span><em><span>Both laugh.</span></em><span>] and I know which one I vastly prefer.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Larissa: </em></strong><em><span>My first goal in America is marry. Second, apply for the green card. And third, buy a car with air conditioner. [Laughs.]</span></em></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>A beat.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Larissa: </em></strong><em><span>I thought that was more big, you know.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Colt: </em></strong><em><span>It\u2019s pretty big.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Larissa: </em></strong><em><span>Like New York.</span></em></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>Up-tempo, jazzy, big-city ambience plays.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Las Vegas is also this thing that\u2019s exported to the rest of the world through our movies and television shows\u2014</span><em><span>Ocean\u2019s 11</span></em><span>. Like, you get this idea that it\u2019s this glamorous, glitzy, big city, you know, \u201cAmerican dreams.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria:</strong><span> Totally.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Blah, blah, blah.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>Totally. Tall buildings, big lights.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>Like, casinos.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Exactly.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Larissa: </em></strong><em><span>My first impressions of Las Vegas? Not a city I expected. I confused Las Vegas with Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York. It\u2019s not like the\u2014the movies.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>And so you see her, like, get out of the car. She\u2019s still very hot. She\u2019s still very uncomfortable. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, here\u2019s the sign!\u201d And this is the world-famous Las Vegas sign. It\u2019s on postcards, it\u2019s on magnets, it\u2019s everywhere. And it was actually surprising to me, \u2019cause I also didn\u2019t realize it was that small. (</span><em><span>Laughs.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Colt: </em></strong><em><span>Are you going back to Brazil? (Chuckles.)</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Larissa: </em></strong><em><span>No, no! I\u2019m sorry.

I think that there\u2019s just a lot more going on here other than just, like, a disappointed woman coming from Brazil. I think it\u2019s, like, way bigger than that.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>A musical descent pulls us into a dreamlike tapestry of synthesizers and percussion.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>Okay, back me up for a second. Why is the show called </span><em><span>90 Day Fianc\u00e9?</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Well, it\u2019s called </span><em><span>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </span></em><span>because, if you\u2019re an American person who wants to marry somebody from another country and you want to bring them to the United States, you can bring them to the United States on something called a K-1 visa, or a fianc\u00e9 visa. And that gives that person permission to come to the United States to get married, but they have to do it within 90 days.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>And so\u2014at least, how it functions in the world of the TV show; I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for a lot of couples\u2014you\u2019re going to spend those 90 days not only planning a wedding, but just, like, getting to know each other better, and figuring out whether or not you </span><em><span>could</span></em><span> actually live together, and whether or not this is what you want to go through with.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>So what you\u2019re saying, like, </span><em><span>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </span></em><span>is a TV show based around this one piece\u2014or, really, like, this one clause\u2014in U.S. immigration policy?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Yes.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>I\u2014I did not realize that. [Hunte laughs.] Like, I guess I\u2019ve always \u2026 The thing I don\u2019t like about reality shows is that, like, they\u2019re sort of contrived. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, 90 days to fall in love.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way the world works.\u201d But, in this case, it is. [</span><em><span>Both laugh.</span></em><span>] It literally is how the world works. Like, the U.S. government came up with this premise.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Yes! Yes. And, Julia, because you haven\u2019t been watching reality TV, you\u2019ve been missing a very important lesson about U.S. immigration policy. [</span><em><span>Both laugh.</span></em><span>] And I think this show is also, like, a really good textbook example of Americans\u2019 relationship with the world, and how the world sees Americans.</span></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>Tonal shift: The music loops over the same few notes, hovering.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>This week, correspondent Tracie Hunte, our resident reality-TV expert, watches one of the biggest shows on television and tells the story of how love got written into U.S. immigration law.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>I\u2019m Julia Longoria.

She\u2019s 23.</span></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>Whimsical, reality-TV-show-style music plays, ostensibly to play up the comedy of the circumstances.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Rose Vega: </em></strong><em><span>My name is Rose, and I am 23 years old. I\u2019m live in Caloocan City, Philippines.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>They met on Facebook, and they\u2019ve had their relationship just on Facebook, and, like, texting and calling. And he\u2019s traveling to the Philippines to meet her and her family\u2014and hopefully fall ever more deeply in love with her, and ask her to marry him.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>Yeah, okay. (</span><em><span>Laughs.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Big Ed: </em></strong><em><span>I spent the night at Rose\u2019s home.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>And in this scene, Big Ed is waking up after spending the night in Rose\u2019s house.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Big Ed: </em></strong><em><span>And this was one of the worst nights of my life. I\u2019m completely drained. I haven\u2019t slept. The mattress that I slept in was soaking wet. This was the first night I\u2019ve ever spent without access to air-conditioning. And I hated it. And I feel broken.</span></em></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>Music fades out.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>(</span><em><span>As Hunte giggles.</span></em><span>) This is just so, so deeply uncomfortable to watch.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>So, like, a lot of this show is cringe. I should just say.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>Yeah. So walk me through what\u2019s happening here.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>So, throughout the time that he\u2019s in the Philippines, there\u2019s, like, a scene where he\u2019s asking her to shave her legs, because he doesn\u2019t find her feminine enough for him. Or he makes a comment about her breath and gives her toothpaste and a toothbrush, but then it comes out that she actually has had an ulcer for many years, and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing her breath, and she\u2019s actually self-conscious about it, and she brushes her teeth all the time. But, on top of all that, Ed travels to the Philippines from San Diego\u2014something like six, seven thousand miles. And he goes because he\u2019s gonna rescue Rose from this situation, this poverty that she\u2019s in. And he\u2019s already been doing that. He\u2019s been, like, sending money to her and her family to help them out. But, from the second that he\u2019s in the Philippines, he\u2019s </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> completely helpless, and </span><em><span>she\u2019s</span></em><span> the one that ends up having to rescue </span><em><span>him</span></em><span> this entire trip.</span></p>\n<p><span>Why I find this so interesting is just, you know, to see this kind of power dynamic play out. And, also, like, it\u2019s just also really interesting to see the disconnect between how Americans see themselves and how the rest of the world sees Americans.</span></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>Soft, lo-fi music plays.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>And so on this show, you see men like Big Ed. They say they lost hope that they could ever find a partner in the U.S., so they turned to international dating. And this is not just, like, some bizarre reality-TV show setup. Like, there\u2019s a whole industry built around this kind of relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>Music out.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Marriage is one of those ways in which women have\u2014for many, many generations and decades\u2014used marriage to get ahead.\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer is a professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race Studies at UC Santa Cruz.

Um \u2026</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hunte: </em></strong><em><span>Wait, what\u2019s a \u201cvacation romance tour\u201d? (Schaeffer chuckles lightly while Hunte laughs outright.)</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>So, that is, um, these sort of big social parties that different companies host so that men from the United States and Canada can travel to Latin American countries and meet women in a big social event.</span></em></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>Lightly bouncy music plays.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>So here\u2019s what Felicity discovered. Say you\u2019re a woman in a foreign country interested in marrying an American man. You might contact one of these international dating sites, and they\u2019ll get some photos of you and include some of your stats.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Their weight, how tall they are\u2014all kinds of personal information\u2014and then their contact.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>The company then compiles these packages filled with these photos and contact info for all these women into these digital catalogs, and American men can look through them. And if they see someone they like, they could email them.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>And then, usually, they\u2019ll all come together for these big sort of social parties.

And they think that they\u2019re gonna find something very different in Russia, Latin America\u2014you know, wherever it is\u2014Asia. And so they often are surprised that women, um, are very strong, have strong personalities, they need certain things, and that they don\u2019t want to usually live in rural areas.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hunte: </em></strong><em><span>Did you peer into the dark heart of American masculinity?</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Yes.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hunte: </em></strong><em><span>What\u2019d you see when you looked\u2014when you peered it into it?

Here\u2019s Colt, the guy who lives in Las Vegas.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Colt:</em></strong><em><span> (Over the funky music again.) After having struck out a few times online with American girls, I thought maybe I could search outside the country, maybe find a girl. (The music fades out.)</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>But, as Americans put themselves on the international marriage market hoping to find someone more beautiful, more loyal, more grateful, if that love turns out not to be true, they also have the power to take that American dream away \u2026 Which brings me to one couple I think about a lot: Ashley and Jay.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Ashley:</em></strong><em><span> (Over soft-rock acoustic guitar.) My name is Ashley. I\u2019m 31 years old, and I\u2019m from Mechanicsburg,</span></em> <em><span>Pennsylvania.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Ashley is in her 30s. She\u2019s white, blond, pretty, and a mother of two from Mechanicsburg, a town in Pennsylvania where more than 90 percent of the residents are white.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>While vacationing in Jamaica, she meets Jay, a Black, 20-year-old tattoo artist.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Ashley: </em></strong><em><span>(Over lightly techno music.) I went to Jamaica with a group of friends and family to a big wedding. And, um, one night we decided to go out to a bar, and that\u2019s where I met Jay.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Ashley says she\u2019s been cheated on before, and Jay more or less admits that being faithful is hard for him. But when he proposes, she says yes. They file for the K-1 visa, and soon he\u2019s on a plane, traveling to live with her in America.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>But Ashley admits that she hasn\u2019t really thought about what that might mean for Jay, to live in a mostly white suburb.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Ashley:</em></strong><em><span> (Over slightly tense music.) I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t have to deal with any racial issues, but I\u2019m also very naive to all of this.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Ashley and Jay get married, but shortly after the wedding, she finds out he had sex with another woman. So she calls him on the phone to confront him.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Ashley: </em></strong><em><span>(The tense music continues, adding drama with each expletive.)</span></em> <em><span>If you show up at my house, the police will be waiting to deport your ass.

But this particular drama of the 90 days and the K-1 visa started way before reality TV.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hunte: </em></strong><em><span>For one thing, I, you know, I just kind of looked at the Wikipedia history of the K-1 visa, and I was kind of surprised to see that [Chuckles.] the Vietnam War had something to do with it.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.

As much as it\u2019s a story about love across borders, it\u2019s also a mini-drama about who we think is worthy of marriage and citizenship, and who has the power to decide. Felicity Amaya Schaeffer\u2014she\u2019s the professor at UC Santa Cruz who did research on so-called romance tours\u2014told us that one of the earliest immigration laws ever passed in the U.S. was about romance, or, at least, sex.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race.\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>The law was called the Page Act, passed in 1875. It restricted the migration of Asian laborers to the United States for, quote, \u201cimmoral purposes.\u201d And it was primarily enforced against Chinese immigrants\u2014but, more specifically, Chinese women.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>If you were the wife of a wealthy Chinese merchant, you could come to the United States. But, if you were a lower-class woman, you could not come. And this has to do with trying to prevent laborers from migrating and bringing women that they thought would destroy the values of the United States.\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>U.S. lawmakers assumed that poor Chinese women coming to the United States were coming here to be sex workers.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>This created some of the legislation that women had to have medical examinations before migrating.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hunte: </em></strong><em><span>Why were they having them do medical exams?</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Chinese women were assumed to spread venereal diseases because they were assumed to be prostitutes. Women had to have that kind of medical exam before they were allowed entry.</span></em></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>Light, ringing synthesizer music seems to travel back in time.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>The law was eventually changed to allow more foreign women into the United States, but that\u2019s because American men demanded it. Starting with the Philippines War in the late 1800s, American men were going all over the world, fighting wars and colonizing\u2014and, in the meantime, meeting women they wanted to bring back to the U.S. and marry.</span></p>\n<p><span>After World War II, thousands of American men wanted to bring women back from Europe and Asia, but couldn\u2019t, because of immigration quotas. So Congress passed the War Brides Act.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>This was a kind of pathway for men to bring back wives. And there was, like, 300,000 women that came.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>It made it easier to bring the spouses of American military members back to the U.S. But the War Brides Act was only in effect for about three years\u20141945 to 1948. And as the Vietnam War began to wind down, American soldiers\u2014who, once again, wanted to bring more foreign wives back to the U.S.\u2014started demanding a more permanent solution.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>So 1970 was when the K-1 process was actually finalized.\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>But the relatively clear, simple, and quick path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship offered by the K-1 visa has alarmed American politicians over the years, and led to panics about marriage fraud.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>There were all kinds of media accounts about these sort of marriage-ring frauds that were allowing people to come in from Havana, and all these subversive types that were using marriage as a way to sort of skirt the usual immigration structures and enter into the country. And I think during the wars, it was a more clear understanding of how people met, and the conditions through which people met.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hunte: </em></strong><em><span>So the soldiers were going overseas, falling in love, bringing women back. Now, when in the absence of that, it\u2019s like, \u201cWait, why are these women coming here?\u201d</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Mhm, mhm! [Hunte laughs.] Yeah! Yeah. \u201cWhat is their motivation for coming here?\u201d I think that\u2019s the next big phase, is already the presumption of fraud after the Vietnam War.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Senator Alan Simpson: </em></strong><em><span>We\u2019re going to examine this issue of immigration marriage fraud.\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Resulting in things like this: a Senate committee hearing on marriage fraud in 1985. Here\u2019s Senator Alan Simpson.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Simpson: </em></strong><em><span>We\u2019re going to inquire into the nature and extent of this situation, determine whether we see but another way of gimmicking our generous\u2014very generous\u2014legal immigration laws.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>And this led to a new immigration law. It made the green card immigrants got after they got married conditional. You didn\u2019t get a permanent green card until after you\u2019d been married for at least two years.</span></p>\n<p><span>Suspicion of immigrants continued well into the \u201990s, but the narrative changed to one where immigrants were now an economic liability.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Because, you know, that\u2019s always the language about immigrants, right? That they\u2019re a drain on the economy, that they\u2019re always taking from and, you know, using these precious resources that should go to citizens.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>So the K-1 visa changed again. In 1996, President Clinton signed a new rule into law. Starting now, Americans who brought a spouse to the U.S. on the K-1 visa were now legally responsible for that person for 10 years.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Even if they divorce, he is taking up responsibility to make sure that she can live\u2014even without a job\u2014for the remainder of 10 years while in this country, if she decides to stay.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hunte: </em></strong><em><span>Wow. Yeah, that is\u2014that is a huge shift.\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah!</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hunte: </em></strong><em><span>That\u2019s huge.\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hunte: </em></strong><em><span>It sounds like it\u2019s to discourage people from doing this, is what it sounds like.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Yes. That is an </span></em><span>entirely</span><em><span> huge shift, and men came to me complaining about that [Laughs.] over and over again.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>As part of her research, Felicity spent a lot of time on listservs for men interested in marrying foreign women. When this rule was put into place, she watched as they began to freak out, asking each other about potential red flags.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>It was everything from, you know, \u201dShe doesn\u2019t want to have sex \u2019til we get married. Is this a red flag?\u201d \u201cIs she affectionate enough?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIs she, uh, hot and sexy in bed?\u201d Like, \u201cDoes she ask for money?\u201d </span></em><span>That</span><em><span> was a big one that would come up.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span>And so, then, women, you know, didn\u2019t have the benefit of this kind of community, but would often talk to me, like, \u201cI feel, really, like I can\u2019t ask him for things that I need, because he seems so suspicious of me.\u201d\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hunte: </em></strong><em><span>Mmm.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>So, you know, it really did affect, um, what they could say to each other, how they would read each other\u2019s actions.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Felicity says the threat of financial consequences for a bad marriage with a foreign spouse may have made these kinds of relationships even more tense.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>And so I think that part of that shift in the K-1 visa structure led to, actually\u2014or maybe facilitated\u2014more abusive relationships, because the men were so skeptical and sort of adopting the view of the state.</span></em></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>A heavy synthesizer whistle plays over a windswept musical landscape.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>In 2000, Anastasia King, a 19-year-old originally from Kyrgyzstan, was murdered by her American husband after she was brought to the U.S. on the K-1 visa. It\u2019s impossible to say for certain whether the pressure and suspicion that increased after changes to the K-1 visa increased the level of violence in these kinds of relationships. But, in response to this abuse, Congress realized it also had to protect immigrant spouses. So it passed the International Marriage Brokerage Regulation Act, or IMBRA, in 2005.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Schaeffer: </em></strong><em><span>Where men have to provide criminal records, and women have to have their rights.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>I spoke to a couple of immigration attorneys who told me immigrant women are still afraid that, if they report their American husbands for abuse, they\u2019ll be deported\u2014though there are provisions within IMBRA and the Violence Against Women Act to protect them. Even still, women in the U.S. on the K-1 visa, separated from family and community and unable to legally work, are often left vulnerable.</span></p>\n<p><span>(</span><em><span>A beat.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Today, as part of the K-1 application process, the foreign fianc\u00e9 has to sit for an interview with an American consular official who\u2019s trying to find out whether your relationship is real or a scam. You\u2019re asked about your American partner\u2019s birthday, education, family\u2014but you\u2019re also asked to maybe describe your engagement, or whether you\u2019re planning to go on a honeymoon, or what kind of wedding you\u2019re going to have.

The word </span></em><span>Lovesick</span><em><span> repeats periodically, like a whisper.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>So, Julia, what do you think?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>I mean, [</span><em><span>Laughs</span></em><span>.] this is, like, what\u2019s so appealing and repulsing about reality TV, right? Watching this desperation on all sides play out like a car accident, you know? Are they here for the right reasons? Will they actually be truly in love?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>You know, there are, like, some couples on the show where it\u2019s kind of obvious that the foreign fianc\u00e9 is, like, only here for that person, and it kind of plays out in these funny ways. Like, I\u2019m thinking about this one couple from the most recent season\u2014Jovi and Yara\u2014and Yara is from the Ukraine, and Jovi is an American guy from New Orleans. And they\u2019re having a fight on the street, and, at one point, Jovi says, \u201cOh, what? You\u2019re just going to go back to the Ukraine?\u201d and she just looks at him and says, \u201cYeah! I\u2019ll go back. I had a really nice life there!\u201d And you can see that she\u2019s, like, not here on a lark. She\u2019s not here because she thinks that the United States is better than the Ukraine. She actually, you know\u2014and she knows there\u2019s a stereotype about eastern European women, and she\u2019s rejecting that. She\u2019s just literally here to be with this guy. So I just also like this show because it\u2019s always questioning your assumptions about people and what their motivations might be.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>Yeah! And it kind of raises the question, like, what are the \u201cright reasons\u201d to be in this kind of relationship\u2014</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>Yeah!</span></p>\n<p><strong>Longoria: </strong><span>\u2014or, really, any, right? (</span><em><span>Chuckles.</span></em><span>)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hunte: </strong><span>And why does the American government even care that much? [</span><em><span>Both laugh.</span></em><span>] You know, if people are scamming, let them scam each other and fall in love. That\u2019s all I have to say!

It\u2019s a little bit long\u2014it\u2019s like seven minutes or so\u2014\u2019cause this is your first time watching <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em>, anything having to do with <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em>, right?</p>\n<p>Julia Longoria: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p>Hunte: Okay, okay.</p>\n<p>Longoria: I\u2019m just curious, like, <em>why</em> are you interested in this? Like, why should someone care?</p>\n<p>Hunte: (<em>Insistently.</em>) Watch the clip, Julia! (<em>Laughs, and Longoria joins in.</em>)</p>\n<p>(<em>Music shifts into long, sustained notes to build drama.</em>)</p>\n<p>Longoria: We start today with correspondent Tracie Hunte guiding me into the unknown: the world of reality TV.</p>\n<p>(<em>A dramatic but upbeat musical flourish plays, like the intro to a theme song, before moving back to the plucky, quirky music.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Okay. So, Julia, <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </em>is a wildly popular show on TLC. It\u2019s about couples who are international\u2014like, it\u2019s usually one person lives in America, and the other person lives somewhere overseas\u2014and I want to begin your <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </em>journey with one couple in particular: Colt and Larissa.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Okay. I\u2019m gonna\u2014do I hit play?</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yes. Hit play!</p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>My name is Colt. I\u2019m 33 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: We are in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we\u2019re at the airport, and we\u2019re meeting Colt and Larissa. Colt is a white guy in his 30s. He lives in Las Vegas.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I am Larissa, 31 years old, from Minas Gerais, Brazil.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And Larissa is from Brazil. She is also in her 30s. And they met online. They went on vacation together\u2014to Cancun, I think\u2014and after five days of this vacation together, Colt asked Larissa to marry him. And so she said yes.</p>\n<p>Longoria: After one date they decided to get married?</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yes, effectively one date. So what we\u2019re doing right now is that we\u2019re meeting Larissa for the first time. She\u2019s just flown into Las Vegas, and this scene is basically her first impressions.</p>\n<p>Longoria: First impressions of Las Vegas, right?</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yes.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Here is hot.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>I don\u2019t have air-conditioning. [A chuckle.] It\u2019s going to get a little hotter too.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Oh my. I can feel the hot, warm.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: First of all, she\u2019s hot. [<em>Longoria chuckles.</em>] It\u2019s not the same sort of warmth in Brazil. I\u2019ve been to Brazil; I know the difference between desert heat and beach heat, [<em>Both laugh.</em>] and I know which one I vastly prefer.</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>My first goal in America is marry. Second, apply for the green card. And third, buy a car with air conditioner. [Laughs.]</em></p>\n<p>(<em>A beat.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I thought that was more big, you know.</em></p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>It\u2019s pretty big.</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Like New York.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Up-tempo, jazzy, big-city ambience plays.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Las Vegas is also this thing that\u2019s exported to the rest of the world through our movies and television shows\u2014<em>Ocean\u2019s 11</em>. Like, you get this idea that it\u2019s this glamorous, glitzy, big city, you know, \u201cAmerican dreams.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Longoria: Totally.</p>\n<p>Hunte: Blah, blah, blah.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Totally. Tall buildings, big lights.</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Like, casinos.</p>\n<p>Hunte: Exactly.</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>My first impressions of Las Vegas? Not a city I expected. I confused Las Vegas with Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York. It\u2019s not like the\u2014the movies.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And so you see her, like, get out of the car. She\u2019s still very hot. She\u2019s still very uncomfortable. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, here\u2019s the sign!\u201d And this is the world-famous Las Vegas sign. It\u2019s on postcards, it\u2019s on magnets, it\u2019s everywhere. And it was actually surprising to me, \u2019cause I also didn\u2019t realize it was that small. (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>Are you going back to Brazil? (Chuckles.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>No, no! I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s\u2014here\u2019s so warm.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>Yeah?</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>(Sighs.) Not in my American dream.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>This is America.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Melodramatic, heavy piano music plays for a moment.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: So yeah. I think that there\u2019s just a lot more going on here other than just, like, a disappointed woman coming from Brazil. I think it\u2019s, like, way bigger than that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(<em>A musical descent pulls us into a dreamlike tapestry of synthesizers and percussion.</em>)</p>\n<p>Longoria: Okay, back me up for a second. Why is the show called <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9?</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Well, it\u2019s called <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </em>because, if you\u2019re an American person who wants to marry somebody from another country and you want to bring them to the United States, you can bring them to the United States on something called a K-1 visa, or a fianc\u00e9 visa. And that gives that person permission to come to the United States to get married, but they have to do it within 90 days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so\u2014at least, how it functions in the world of the TV show; I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for a lot of couples\u2014you\u2019re going to spend those 90 days not only planning a wedding, but just, like, getting to know each other better, and figuring out whether or not you <em>could</em> actually live together, and whether or not this is what you want to go through with.</p>\n<p>Longoria: So what you\u2019re saying, like, <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </em>is a TV show based around this one piece\u2014or, really, like, this one clause\u2014in U.S. immigration policy?</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yes.</p>\n<p>Longoria: I\u2014I did not realize that. [Hunte laughs.] Like, I guess I\u2019ve always \u2026 The thing I don\u2019t like about reality shows is that, like, they\u2019re sort of contrived. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, 90 days to fall in love.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way the world works.\u201d But, in this case, it is. [<em>Both laugh.</em>] It literally is how the world works. Like, the U.S. government came up with this premise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yes! Yes. And, Julia, because you haven\u2019t been watching reality TV, you\u2019ve been missing a very important lesson about U.S. immigration policy. [<em>Both laugh.</em>] And I think this show is also, like, a really good textbook example of Americans\u2019 relationship with the world, and how the world sees Americans.</p>\n<p>(<em>Tonal shift: The music loops over the same few notes, hovering.</em>)</p>\n<p>Longoria: This week, correspondent Tracie Hunte, our resident reality-TV expert, watches one of the biggest shows on television and tells the story of how love got written into U.S. immigration law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u2019m Julia Longoria. This is <em>The Experiment</em>.</p>\n<p>(<em>The notes hover for a moment more before cutting out.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Okay. So, new couple. This is Big Ed.</p>\n<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>I\u2019m Ed. I\u2019m 54 years old. People know me as \u201cBig Ed.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Fast-paced plucky guitar music plays.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>I\u2019m from San Diego, California. [A camera shutter clicks.] And I am a professional photographer.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Big Ed, American white man in his 50s. He actually gave himself the name \u201cBig Ed.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>It\u2019s funny because I\u2019m not tall. I am actually 4\u201911.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And then there\u2019s Rose, who is much younger. She\u2019s 23.</p>\n<p>(<em>Whimsical, reality-TV-show-style music plays, ostensibly to play up the comedy of the circumstances.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Rose Vega: </em><em>My name is Rose, and I am 23 years old. I\u2019m live in Caloocan City, Philippines.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: They met on Facebook, and they\u2019ve had their relationship just on Facebook, and, like, texting and calling. And he\u2019s traveling to the Philippines to meet her and her family\u2014and hopefully fall ever more deeply in love with her, and ask her to marry him.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Yeah, okay. (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>I spent the night at Rose\u2019s home.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And in this scene, Big Ed is waking up after spending the night in Rose\u2019s house.</p>\n<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>And this was one of the worst nights of my life. I\u2019m completely drained. I haven\u2019t slept. The mattress that I slept in was soaking wet. This was the first night I\u2019ve ever spent without access to air-conditioning. And I hated it. And I feel broken.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Music fades out.</em>)</p>\n<p>Longoria: (<em>As Hunte giggles.</em>) This is just so, so deeply uncomfortable to watch.</p>\n<p>Hunte: So, like, a lot of this show is cringe. I should just say.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Yeah. So walk me through what\u2019s happening here.</p>\n<p>Hunte: So, throughout the time that he\u2019s in the Philippines, there\u2019s, like, a scene where he\u2019s asking her to shave her legs, because he doesn\u2019t find her feminine enough for him. Or he makes a comment about her breath and gives her toothpaste and a toothbrush, but then it comes out that she actually has had an ulcer for many years, and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing her breath, and she\u2019s actually self-conscious about it, and she brushes her teeth all the time. But, on top of all that, Ed travels to the Philippines from San Diego\u2014something like six, seven thousand miles. And he goes because he\u2019s gonna rescue Rose from this situation, this poverty that she\u2019s in. And he\u2019s already been doing that. He\u2019s been, like, sending money to her and her family to help them out. But, from the second that he\u2019s in the Philippines, he\u2019s <em>so</em> completely helpless, and <em>she\u2019s</em> the one that ends up having to rescue <em>him</em> this entire trip.</p>\n<p>Why I find this so interesting is just, you know, to see this kind of power dynamic play out. And, also, like, it\u2019s just also really interesting to see the disconnect between how Americans see themselves and how the rest of the world sees Americans.</p>\n<p>(<em>Soft, lo-fi music plays.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: And so on this show, you see men like Big Ed. They say they lost hope that they could ever find a partner in the U.S., so they turned to international dating. And this is not just, like, some bizarre reality-TV show setup. Like, there\u2019s a whole industry built around this kind of relationship.</p>\n<p>(<em>Music out.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer: </em><em>Marriage is one of those ways in which women have\u2014for many, many generations and decades\u2014used marriage to get ahead.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Felicity Amaya Schaeffer is a professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race Studies at UC Santa Cruz. She\u2019s also the author of the book <em>Love and Empire. </em>Way before<em> 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, </em>Felicity became interested in how immigrants were using marriage to cross the border into the U.S. Over three years, she talked to dozens of men and women who were interested in these kinds of relationships.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>I ended up in Colombia and Mexico, interviewing women and men at these vacation romance tours about why they were interested in dating someone. Um \u2026</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Wait, what\u2019s a \u201cvacation romance tour\u201d? (Schaeffer chuckles lightly while Hunte laughs outright.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So, that is, um, these sort of big social parties that different companies host so that men from the United States and Canada can travel to Latin American countries and meet women in a big social event.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Lightly bouncy music plays.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: So here\u2019s what Felicity discovered. Say you\u2019re a woman in a foreign country interested in marrying an American man. You might contact one of these international dating sites, and they\u2019ll get some photos of you and include some of your stats.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Their weight, how tall they are\u2014all kinds of personal information\u2014and then their contact.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: The company then compiles these packages filled with these photos and contact info for all these women into these digital catalogs, and American men can look through them. And if they see someone they like, they could email them.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And then, usually, they\u2019ll all come together for these big sort of social parties. And it\u2019s a quick way to meet lots of women and for the women to be introduced to lots of men, all in one place.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Which is where Felicity would show up, asking questions.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Part of this that I\u2019m also interested in is the fantasies that foreign women usually have of life in the United States, and vice versa.</em></p>\n<p><em>You know, men sort of think that U.S. women are much too feminist and too modern and too independent. And they think that they\u2019re gonna find something very different in Russia, Latin America\u2014you know, wherever it is\u2014Asia. And so they often are surprised that women, um, are very strong, have strong personalities, they need certain things, and that they don\u2019t want to usually live in rural areas.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Did you peer into the dark heart of American masculinity?</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>What\u2019d you see when you looked\u2014when you peered it into it? (Laughs.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Oh my God, I mean, so many insecurities! Given the way in which desire is so entwined with status and money, you know, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a sad structure, that sort of capitalist context in which certain people become no one if you don\u2019t have some game.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>I have this amazing interview with a guy who said to me something that really clarified things. He said, \u201cYou know, in the United States, I\u2019m just the average Joe. But when I cross the border, I become Tom Cruise.\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>It was hard, in some ways, and I felt really creepy. And then it was also sad, you know, to see that there\u2019s so many lonely people that are just sort of in the shadows, um, that can\u2019t meet anyone and just, like, really want to connect.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Hmm.</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And these women are just desperate to come to the United States. And that the men, in some ways, broker their ticket to getting here.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Have you ever watched </em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9,<em> or heard about it?</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes. I have watched some of the episodes, of course! (Laughs.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>You watched it. Okay.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>It\u2019s hard to watch too many.</em></p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>(Over funky music.) I never thought I would get married. All my previous relationships have ended with me getting a broken heart. (The funky music continues under Hunte\u2019s narration.)</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Watching <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em>, I got this feeling that, for a lot of the cast, they might actually believe that a shot at the American dream is all they have to offer in exchange for love. Here\u2019s Colt, the guy who lives in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p><em>Colt:</em><em> (Over the funky music again.) After having struck out a few times online with American girls, I thought maybe I could search outside the country, maybe find a girl. (The music fades out.)</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: But, as Americans put themselves on the international marriage market hoping to find someone more beautiful, more loyal, more grateful, if that love turns out not to be true, they also have the power to take that American dream away \u2026 Which brings me to one couple I think about a lot: Ashley and Jay.</p>\n<p><em>Ashley:</em><em> (Over soft-rock acoustic guitar.) My name is Ashley. I\u2019m 31 years old, and I\u2019m from Mechanicsburg,</em> <em>Pennsylvania.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Ashley is in her 30s. She\u2019s white, blond, pretty, and a mother of two from Mechanicsburg, a town in Pennsylvania where more than 90 percent of the residents are white.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While vacationing in Jamaica, she meets Jay, a Black, 20-year-old tattoo artist.</p>\n<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>(Over lightly techno music.) I went to Jamaica with a group of friends and family to a big wedding. And, um, one night we decided to go out to a bar, and that\u2019s where I met Jay.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Ashley says she\u2019s been cheated on before, and Jay more or less admits that being faithful is hard for him. But when he proposes, she says yes. They file for the K-1 visa, and soon he\u2019s on a plane, traveling to live with her in America.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Ashley admits that she hasn\u2019t really thought about what that might mean for Jay, to live in a mostly white suburb.</p>\n<p><em>Ashley:</em><em> (Over slightly tense music.) I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t have to deal with any racial issues, but I\u2019m also very naive to all of this.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Ashley and Jay get married, but shortly after the wedding, she finds out he had sex with another woman. So she calls him on the phone to confront him.</p>\n<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>(The tense music continues, adding drama with each expletive.)</em> <em>If you show up at my house, the police will be waiting to deport your ass. I don\u2019t give a f***. I do not give a f***. He has to sit and rot in jail until they deport his ass. I don\u2019t give a f***.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And, just like that, Ashley goes from being this naive white woman who doesn\u2019t understand race in America to a white woman asking the police to remove her disappointing Black, immigrant husband from her life, and from <em>her</em> country.</p>\n<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>I don\u2019t want him near me. I don\u2019t even want him in this country. He\u2019s here illegally. He needs to go back to Jamaica.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Low percussive music plays.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Some of this ugliness\u2014this icky gender and racial dynamics, the heartbreak\u2014this is just classic reality-TV-show stuff. But this particular drama of the 90 days and the K-1 visa started way before reality TV.</p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>For one thing, I, you know, I just kind of looked at the Wikipedia history of the K-1 visa, and I was kind of surprised to see that [Chuckles.] the Vietnam War had something to do with it.</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah. I mean, it actually has a lot longer history, I would say, than the Vietnam War.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: After the break, how love got turned into a visa application.</p>\n<p>(<em>A moment of synthesizer melody plays above the percussive music, followed by the break.</em>)</p>\n<p>(<em>A quick, goofy musical flourish.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: The journey to <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em> is a long and winding one. As much as it\u2019s a story about love across borders, it\u2019s also a mini-drama about who we think is worthy of marriage and citizenship, and who has the power to decide. Felicity Amaya Schaeffer\u2014she\u2019s the professor at UC Santa Cruz who did research on so-called romance tours\u2014told us that one of the earliest immigration laws ever passed in the U.S. was about romance, or, at least, sex.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: The law was called the Page Act, passed in 1875. It restricted the migration of Asian laborers to the United States for, quote, \u201cimmoral purposes.\u201d And it was primarily enforced against Chinese immigrants\u2014but, more specifically, Chinese women.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>If you were the wife of a wealthy Chinese merchant, you could come to the United States. But, if you were a lower-class woman, you could not come. And this has to do with trying to prevent laborers from migrating and bringing women that they thought would destroy the values of the United States.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: U.S. lawmakers assumed that poor Chinese women coming to the United States were coming here to be sex workers.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>This created some of the legislation that women had to have medical examinations before migrating.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Why were they having them do medical exams?</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Chinese women were assumed to spread venereal diseases because they were assumed to be prostitutes. Women had to have that kind of medical exam before they were allowed entry.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Light, ringing synthesizer music seems to travel back in time.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: The law was eventually changed to allow more foreign women into the United States, but that\u2019s because American men demanded it. Starting with the Philippines War in the late 1800s, American men were going all over the world, fighting wars and colonizing\u2014and, in the meantime, meeting women they wanted to bring back to the U.S. and marry.</p>\n<p>After World War II, thousands of American men wanted to bring women back from Europe and Asia, but couldn\u2019t, because of immigration quotas. So Congress passed the War Brides Act.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>This was a kind of pathway for men to bring back wives. And there was, like, 300,000 women that came.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: It made it easier to bring the spouses of American military members back to the U.S. But the War Brides Act was only in effect for about three years\u20141945 to 1948. And as the Vietnam War began to wind down, American soldiers\u2014who, once again, wanted to bring more foreign wives back to the U.S.\u2014started demanding a more permanent solution.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So 1970 was when the K-1 process was actually finalized.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: But the relatively clear, simple, and quick path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship offered by the K-1 visa has alarmed American politicians over the years, and led to panics about marriage fraud.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>There were all kinds of media accounts about these sort of marriage-ring frauds that were allowing people to come in from Havana, and all these subversive types that were using marriage as a way to sort of skirt the usual immigration structures and enter into the country. And I think during the wars, it was a more clear understanding of how people met, and the conditions through which people met.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>So the soldiers were going overseas, falling in love, bringing women back. Now, when in the absence of that, it\u2019s like, \u201cWait, why are these women coming here?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Mhm, mhm! [Hunte laughs.] Yeah! Yeah. \u201cWhat is their motivation for coming here?\u201d I think that\u2019s the next big phase, is already the presumption of fraud after the Vietnam War.</em></p>\n<p><em>Senator Alan Simpson: </em><em>We\u2019re going to examine this issue of immigration marriage fraud.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Resulting in things like this: a Senate committee hearing on marriage fraud in 1985. Here\u2019s Senator Alan Simpson.</p>\n<p><em>Simpson: </em><em>We\u2019re going to inquire into the nature and extent of this situation, determine whether we see but another way of gimmicking our generous\u2014very generous\u2014legal immigration laws.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And this led to a new immigration law. It made the green card immigrants got after they got married conditional. You didn\u2019t get a permanent green card until after you\u2019d been married for at least two years.</p>\n<p>Suspicion of immigrants continued well into the \u201990s, but the narrative changed to one where immigrants were now an economic liability.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Because, you know, that\u2019s always the language about immigrants, right? That they\u2019re a drain on the economy, that they\u2019re always taking from and, you know, using these precious resources that should go to citizens.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: So the K-1 visa changed again. In 1996, President Clinton signed a new rule into law. Starting now, Americans who brought a spouse to the U.S. on the K-1 visa were now legally responsible for that person for 10 years.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Even if they divorce, he is taking up responsibility to make sure that she can live\u2014even without a job\u2014for the remainder of 10 years while in this country, if she decides to stay.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Wow. Yeah, that is\u2014that is a huge shift.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah!</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>That\u2019s huge.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>It sounds like it\u2019s to discourage people from doing this, is what it sounds like.</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes. That is an </em>entirely<em> huge shift, and men came to me complaining about that [Laughs.] over and over again.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: As part of her research, Felicity spent a lot of time on listservs for men interested in marrying foreign women. When this rule was put into place, she watched as they began to freak out, asking each other about potential red flags.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>It was everything from, you know, \u201dShe doesn\u2019t want to have sex \u2019til we get married. Is this a red flag?\u201d \u201cIs she affectionate enough?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIs she, uh, hot and sexy in bed?\u201d Like, \u201cDoes she ask for money?\u201d </em>That<em> was a big one that would come up.</em></p>\n<p><em>And so, then, women, you know, didn\u2019t have the benefit of this kind of community, but would often talk to me, like, \u201cI feel, really, like I can\u2019t ask him for things that I need, because he seems so suspicious of me.\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Mmm.</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So, you know, it really did affect, um, what they could say to each other, how they would read each other\u2019s actions.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Felicity says the threat of financial consequences for a bad marriage with a foreign spouse may have made these kinds of relationships even more tense.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And so I think that part of that shift in the K-1 visa structure led to, actually\u2014or maybe facilitated\u2014more abusive relationships, because the men were so skeptical and sort of adopting the view of the state.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>A heavy synthesizer whistle plays over a windswept musical landscape.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: In 2000, Anastasia King, a 19-year-old originally from Kyrgyzstan, was murdered by her American husband after she was brought to the U.S. on the K-1 visa. It\u2019s impossible to say for certain whether the pressure and suspicion that increased after changes to the K-1 visa increased the level of violence in these kinds of relationships. But, in response to this abuse, Congress realized it also had to protect immigrant spouses. So it passed the International Marriage Brokerage Regulation Act, or IMBRA, in 2005.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Where men have to provide criminal records, and women have to have their rights.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: I spoke to a couple of immigration attorneys who told me immigrant women are still afraid that, if they report their American husbands for abuse, they\u2019ll be deported\u2014though there are provisions within IMBRA and the Violence Against Women Act to protect them. Even still, women in the U.S. on the K-1 visa, separated from family and community and unable to legally work, are often left vulnerable.</p>\n<p>(<em>A beat.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Today, as part of the K-1 application process, the foreign fianc\u00e9 has to sit for an interview with an American consular official who\u2019s trying to find out whether your relationship is real or a scam. You\u2019re asked about your American partner\u2019s birthday, education, family\u2014but you\u2019re also asked to maybe describe your engagement, or whether you\u2019re planning to go on a honeymoon, or what kind of wedding you\u2019re going to have. In other words, are you here for the right reasons? Do you really love this person?</p>\n<p>(<em>Heavy music plays.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>John, Colt\u2019s cousin: </em><em>How do you express your love to Colt?</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>To show love? For me, it\u2019s clean the house.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>The music continues under the narration.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Those interviews with consular officials are never caught on camera. But you can kind of get an idea of how they might go, watching friends and family on <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em> question the would-be foreign spouse. Here\u2019s Colt\u2019s cousin, John, asking Larissa to prove she loves Colt.</p>\n<p>(<em>The heavy music continues.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>John: </em><em>You\u2019re not just coming over here to marry my man for a green card, are ya?</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I\u2019m with him because I love him.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>The music changes tone, like an investigative journalist intro on a late-night news show.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>(In a confessional interview.) Honestly, John was acting like he\u2019s policy or immigration officer. He was really rude to me.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>The news-show music fades out.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>The United States is about choice and equality and democracy. So it\u2019s interesting to think about how romance sort of sits in for all of these other values of a democracy. Like, are you capable of consenting to this? Or, if you come from a poor background, are you forced into this because you have no other recourse? That you really choose this person because you love them, and not for any other reasons. So it\u2019s this sort of divorcing of economic questions from romantic ones.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Soft, pensive electric guitar plays over lo-fi electronica. The word </em>Lovesick<em> repeats periodically, like a whisper.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: So, Julia, what do you think?</p>\n<p>Longoria: I mean, [<em>Laughs</em>.] this is, like, what\u2019s so appealing and repulsing about reality TV, right? Watching this desperation on all sides play out like a car accident, you know? Are they here for the right reasons? Will they actually be truly in love?</p>\n<p>Hunte: You know, there are, like, some couples on the show where it\u2019s kind of obvious that the foreign fianc\u00e9 is, like, only here for that person, and it kind of plays out in these funny ways. Like, I\u2019m thinking about this one couple from the most recent season\u2014Jovi and Yara\u2014and Yara is from the Ukraine, and Jovi is an American guy from New Orleans. And they\u2019re having a fight on the street, and, at one point, Jovi says, \u201cOh, what? You\u2019re just going to go back to the Ukraine?\u201d and she just looks at him and says, \u201cYeah! I\u2019ll go back. I had a really nice life there!\u201d And you can see that she\u2019s, like, not here on a lark. She\u2019s not here because she thinks that the United States is better than the Ukraine. She actually, you know\u2014and she knows there\u2019s a stereotype about eastern European women, and she\u2019s rejecting that. She\u2019s just literally here to be with this guy. So I just also like this show because it\u2019s always questioning your assumptions about people and what their motivations might be.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Yeah! And it kind of raises the question, like, what are the \u201cright reasons\u201d to be in this kind of relationship\u2014</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yeah!</p>\n<p>Longoria: \u2014or, really, any, right? (<em>Chuckles.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: And why does the American government even care that much? [<em>Both laugh.</em>] You know, if people are scamming, let them scam each other and fall in love. That\u2019s all I have to say! (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>\n<p>(<em>Upbeat, bubblegum techno music plays up.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: I already think I know the answer to this question, but, Julia, do you think you will watch <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em>? (<em>Bursts out laughing, and Longoria laughs too.</em>)</p>\n<p>Longoria: I mean, you watched it so I don\u2019t have to!</p>\n<p>Hunte: Alright! Fair enough, fair enough.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Dating shows often push contestants to extreme measures in pursuit of love. Reality-show producers will impose fake deadlines, physical obstacles, and manufactured drama to create the juiciest spectacle. But on TLC\u2019s 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, a high-stakes and wildly popular reality show, the producers didn\u2019t need to dream up a deadline: It\u2019s a requirement of the rigorous U.S. visa-application process.\u00a0\nThe show follows real-life couples pursuing a K-1 visa\u2014the \u201cfianc\u00e9 visa\u201d\u2014which allows a U.S. citizen\u2019s foreign partner to enter the U.S. legally, but only for 90 days, the deadline by which they must get married. The show documents the complications of those emotionally charged 90 days, when two people from different countries, cultures, and sometimes races have to decide whether their relationship is real.\n\u201cFrom the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race as it\u2019s intersecting with class and sexuality,\u201d says Felicity Amaya Schaeffer, a professor of feminist studies and critical race studies at UC Santa Cruz.\nBe part of The Experiment.

It\u2019s a little bit long\u2014it\u2019s like seven minutes or so\u2014\u2019cause this is your first time watching 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, anything having to do with 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, right?\nJulia Longoria: That\u2019s correct.\nHunte: Okay, okay.\nLongoria: I\u2019m just curious, like, why are you interested in this? Like, why should someone care?\nHunte: (Insistently.) Watch the clip, Julia! (Laughs, and Longoria joins in.)\n(Music shifts into long, sustained notes to build drama.)\nLongoria: We start today with correspondent Tracie Hunte guiding me into the unknown: the world of reality TV.\n(A dramatic but upbeat musical flourish plays, like the intro to a theme song, before moving back to the plucky, quirky music.)\nHunte: Okay. So, Julia, 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 is a wildly popular show on TLC. It\u2019s about couples who are international\u2014like, it\u2019s usually one person lives in America, and the other person lives somewhere overseas\u2014and I want to begin your 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 journey with one couple in particular: Colt and Larissa.\nLongoria: Okay. I\u2019m gonna\u2014do I hit play?\nHunte: Yes. Hit play!\nColt: My name is Colt. I\u2019m 33 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nHunte: We are in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we\u2019re at the airport, and we\u2019re meeting Colt and Larissa. Colt is a white guy in his 30s. He lives in Las Vegas.\u00a0\nLarissa: I am Larissa, 31 years old, from Minas Gerais, Brazil.\nHunte: And Larissa is from Brazil. She is also in her 30s. And they met online. They went on vacation together\u2014to Cancun, I think\u2014and after five days of this vacation together, Colt asked Larissa to marry him. And so she said yes.\nLongoria: After one date they decided to get married?\nHunte: Yes, effectively one date. So what we\u2019re doing right now is that we\u2019re meeting Larissa for the first time. She\u2019s just flown into Las Vegas, and this scene is basically her first impressions.\nLongoria: First impressions of Las Vegas, right?\nHunte: Yes.\u00a0\nLarissa: Here is hot.\u00a0\nColt: I don\u2019t have air-conditioning. [A chuckle.] It\u2019s going to get a little hotter too.\u00a0\nLarissa: Oh my. I can feel the hot, warm.\nHunte: First of all, she\u2019s hot. [Longoria chuckles.] It\u2019s not the same sort of warmth in Brazil. I\u2019ve been to Brazil; I know the difference between desert heat and beach heat, [Both laugh.] and I know which one I vastly prefer.\nLarissa: My first goal in America is marry. Second, apply for the green card. And third, buy a car with air conditioner. [Laughs.]\n(A beat.)\nLarissa: I thought that was more big, you know.\nColt: It\u2019s pretty big.\nLarissa: Like New York.\n(Up-tempo, jazzy, big-city ambience plays.)\nHunte: Las Vegas is also this thing that\u2019s exported to the rest of the world through our movies and television shows\u2014Ocean\u2019s 11. Like, you get this idea that it\u2019s this glamorous, glitzy, big city, you know, \u201cAmerican dreams.\u201d\u00a0\nLongoria: Totally.\nHunte: Blah, blah, blah.\nLongoria: Totally. Tall buildings, big lights.\nHunte: Yeah.\nLongoria: Like, casinos.\nHunte: Exactly.\nLarissa: My first impressions of Las Vegas? Not a city I expected. I confused Las Vegas with Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York. It\u2019s not like the\u2014the movies.\nHunte: And so you see her, like, get out of the car. She\u2019s still very hot. She\u2019s still very uncomfortable. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, here\u2019s the sign!\u201d And this is the world-famous Las Vegas sign. It\u2019s on postcards, it\u2019s on magnets, it\u2019s everywhere. And it was actually surprising to me, \u2019cause I also didn\u2019t realize it was that small. (Laughs.)\nColt: Are you going back to Brazil? (Chuckles.)\nLarissa: No, no! I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s\u2014here\u2019s so warm.\u00a0\nColt: Yeah?\nLarissa: (Sighs.) Not in my American dream.\u00a0\nColt: This is America.\n(Melodramatic, heavy piano music plays for a moment.)\nHunte: So yeah. I think that there\u2019s just a lot more going on here other than just, like, a disappointed woman coming from Brazil. I think it\u2019s, like, way bigger than that.\u00a0\n(A musical descent pulls us into a dreamlike tapestry of synthesizers and percussion.)\nLongoria: Okay, back me up for a second. Why is the show called 90 Day Fianc\u00e9?\nHunte: Well, it\u2019s called 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 because, if you\u2019re an American person who wants to marry somebody from another country and you want to bring them to the United States, you can bring them to the United States on something called a K-1 visa, or a fianc\u00e9 visa. And that gives that person permission to come to the United States to get married, but they have to do it within 90 days.\u00a0\nAnd so\u2014at least, how it functions in the world of the TV show; I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for a lot of couples\u2014you\u2019re going to spend those 90 days not only planning a wedding, but just, like, getting to know each other better, and figuring out whether or not you could actually live together, and whether or not this is what you want to go through with.\nLongoria: So what you\u2019re saying, like, 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 is a TV show based around this one piece\u2014or, really, like, this one clause\u2014in U.S. immigration policy?\nHunte: Yes.\nLongoria: I\u2014I did not realize that. [Hunte laughs.] Like, I guess I\u2019ve always \u2026 The thing I don\u2019t like about reality shows is that, like, they\u2019re sort of contrived. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, 90 days to fall in love.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way the world works.\u201d But, in this case, it is. [Both laugh.] It literally is how the world works. Like, the U.S. government came up with this premise.\u00a0\nHunte: Yes! Yes. And, Julia, because you haven\u2019t been watching reality TV, you\u2019ve been missing a very important lesson about U.S. immigration policy. [Both laugh.] And I think this show is also, like, a really good textbook example of Americans\u2019 relationship with the world, and how the world sees Americans.\n(Tonal shift: The music loops over the same few notes, hovering.)\nLongoria: This week, correspondent Tracie Hunte, our resident reality-TV expert, watches one of the biggest shows on television and tells the story of how love got written into U.S. immigration law.\u00a0\nI\u2019m Julia Longoria. This is The Experiment.\n(The notes hover for a moment more before cutting out.)\nHunte: Okay. So, new couple. This is Big Ed.\nBig Ed: I\u2019m Ed. I\u2019m 54 years old. People know me as \u201cBig Ed.\u201d\n(Fast-paced plucky guitar music plays.)\nBig Ed: I\u2019m from San Diego, California. [A camera shutter clicks.] And I am a professional photographer.\nHunte: Big Ed, American white man in his 50s. He actually gave himself the name \u201cBig Ed.\u201d\nBig Ed: It\u2019s funny because I\u2019m not tall. I am actually 4\u201911.\nHunte: And then there\u2019s Rose, who is much younger. She\u2019s 23.\n(Whimsical, reality-TV-show-style music plays, ostensibly to play up the comedy of the circumstances.)\nRose Vega: My name is Rose, and I am 23 years old. I\u2019m live in Caloocan City, Philippines.\nHunte: They met on Facebook, and they\u2019ve had their relationship just on Facebook, and, like, texting and calling. And he\u2019s traveling to the Philippines to meet her and her family\u2014and hopefully fall ever more deeply in love with her, and ask her to marry him.\nLongoria: Yeah, okay. (Laughs.)\nBig Ed: I spent the night at Rose\u2019s home.\nHunte: And in this scene, Big Ed is waking up after spending the night in Rose\u2019s house.\nBig Ed: And this was one of the worst nights of my life. I\u2019m completely drained. I haven\u2019t slept. The mattress that I slept in was soaking wet. This was the first night I\u2019ve ever spent without access to air-conditioning. And I hated it. And I feel broken.\n(Music fades out.)\nLongoria: (As Hunte giggles.) This is just so, so deeply uncomfortable to watch.\nHunte: So, like, a lot of this show is cringe. I should just say.\nLongoria: Yeah. So walk me through what\u2019s happening here.\nHunte: So, throughout the time that he\u2019s in the Philippines, there\u2019s, like, a scene where he\u2019s asking her to shave her legs, because he doesn\u2019t find her feminine enough for him. Or he makes a comment about her breath and gives her toothpaste and a toothbrush, but then it comes out that she actually has had an ulcer for many years, and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing her breath, and she\u2019s actually self-conscious about it, and she brushes her teeth all the time. But, on top of all that, Ed travels to the Philippines from San Diego\u2014something like six, seven thousand miles. And he goes because he\u2019s gonna rescue Rose from this situation, this poverty that she\u2019s in. And he\u2019s already been doing that. He\u2019s been, like, sending money to her and her family to help them out. But, from the second that he\u2019s in the Philippines, he\u2019s so completely helpless, and she\u2019s the one that ends up having to rescue him this entire trip.\nWhy I find this so interesting is just, you know, to see this kind of power dynamic play out. And, also, like, it\u2019s just also really interesting to see the disconnect between how Americans see themselves and how the rest of the world sees Americans.\n(Soft, lo-fi music plays.)\nHunte: And so on this show, you see men like Big Ed. They say they lost hope that they could ever find a partner in the U.S., so they turned to international dating. And this is not just, like, some bizarre reality-TV show setup. Like, there\u2019s a whole industry built around this kind of relationship.\n(Music out.)\nFelicity Amaya Schaeffer: Marriage is one of those ways in which women have\u2014for many, many generations and decades\u2014used marriage to get ahead.\u00a0\nHunte: Felicity Amaya Schaeffer is a professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race Studies at UC Santa Cruz. She\u2019s also the author of the book Love and Empire. Way before 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, Felicity became interested in how immigrants were using marriage to cross the border into the U.S. Over three years, she talked to dozens of men and women who were interested in these kinds of relationships.\nSchaeffer: I ended up in Colombia and Mexico, interviewing women and men at these vacation romance tours about why they were interested in dating someone. Um \u2026\nHunte: Wait, what\u2019s a \u201cvacation romance tour\u201d? (Schaeffer chuckles lightly while Hunte laughs outright.)\nSchaeffer: So, that is, um, these sort of big social parties that different companies host so that men from the United States and Canada can travel to Latin American countries and meet women in a big social event.\n(Lightly bouncy music plays.)\nHunte: So here\u2019s what Felicity discovered. Say you\u2019re a woman in a foreign country interested in marrying an American man. You might contact one of these international dating sites, and they\u2019ll get some photos of you and include some of your stats.\nSchaeffer: Their weight, how tall they are\u2014all kinds of personal information\u2014and then their contact.\nHunte: The company then compiles these packages filled with these photos and contact info for all these women into these digital catalogs, and American men can look through them. And if they see someone they like, they could email them.\nSchaeffer: And then, usually, they\u2019ll all come together for these big sort of social parties. And it\u2019s a quick way to meet lots of women and for the women to be introduced to lots of men, all in one place.\u00a0\nHunte: Which is where Felicity would show up, asking questions.\nSchaeffer: Part of this that I\u2019m also interested in is the fantasies that foreign women usually have of life in the United States, and vice versa.\nYou know, men sort of think that U.S. women are much too feminist and too modern and too independent. And they think that they\u2019re gonna find something very different in Russia, Latin America\u2014you know, wherever it is\u2014Asia. And so they often are surprised that women, um, are very strong, have strong personalities, they need certain things, and that they don\u2019t want to usually live in rural areas.\nHunte: Did you peer into the dark heart of American masculinity?\nSchaeffer: Yes.\nHunte: What\u2019d you see when you looked\u2014when you peered it into it? (Laughs.)\nSchaeffer: Oh my God, I mean, so many insecurities! Given the way in which desire is so entwined with status and money, you know, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a sad structure, that sort of capitalist context in which certain people become no one if you don\u2019t have some game.\u00a0\nI have this amazing interview with a guy who said to me something that really clarified things. He said, \u201cYou know, in the United States, I\u2019m just the average Joe. But when I cross the border, I become Tom Cruise.\u201d\u00a0\nIt was hard, in some ways, and I felt really creepy. And then it was also sad, you know, to see that there\u2019s so many lonely people that are just sort of in the shadows, um, that can\u2019t meet anyone and just, like, really want to connect.\nHunte: Hmm.\nSchaeffer: And these women are just desperate to come to the United States. And that the men, in some ways, broker their ticket to getting here.\u00a0\nHunte: Have you ever watched 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, or heard about it?\nSchaeffer: Yes. I have watched some of the episodes, of course! (Laughs.)\nHunte: You watched it. Okay.\u00a0\nSchaeffer: It\u2019s hard to watch too many.\nColt: (Over funky music.) I never thought I would get married. All my previous relationships have ended with me getting a broken heart. (The funky music continues under Hunte\u2019s narration.)\nHunte: Watching 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, I got this feeling that, for a lot of the cast, they might actually believe that a shot at the American dream is all they have to offer in exchange for love. Here\u2019s Colt, the guy who lives in Las Vegas.\nColt: (Over the funky music again.) After having struck out a few times online with American girls, I thought maybe I could search outside the country, maybe find a girl. (The music fades out.)\nHunte: But, as Americans put themselves on the international marriage market hoping to find someone more beautiful, more loyal, more grateful, if that love turns out not to be true, they also have the power to take that American dream away \u2026 Which brings me to one couple I think about a lot: Ashley and Jay.\nAshley: (Over soft-rock acoustic guitar.) My name is Ashley. I\u2019m 31 years old, and I\u2019m from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.\nHunte: Ashley is in her 30s. She\u2019s white, blond, pretty, and a mother of two from Mechanicsburg, a town in Pennsylvania where more than 90 percent of the residents are white.\u00a0\nWhile vacationing in Jamaica, she meets Jay, a Black, 20-year-old tattoo artist.\nAshley: (Over lightly techno music.) I went to Jamaica with a group of friends and family to a big wedding. And, um, one night we decided to go out to a bar, and that\u2019s where I met Jay.\nHunte: Ashley says she\u2019s been cheated on before, and Jay more or less admits that being faithful is hard for him. But when he proposes, she says yes. They file for the K-1 visa, and soon he\u2019s on a plane, traveling to live with her in America.\u00a0\nBut Ashley admits that she hasn\u2019t really thought about what that might mean for Jay, to live in a mostly white suburb.\nAshley: (Over slightly tense music.) I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t have to deal with any racial issues, but I\u2019m also very naive to all of this.\nHunte: Ashley and Jay get married, but shortly after the wedding, she finds out he had sex with another woman. So she calls him on the phone to confront him.\nAshley: (The tense music continues, adding drama with each expletive.) If you show up at my house, the police will be waiting to deport your ass. I don\u2019t give a f***. I do not give a f***. He has to sit and rot in jail until they deport his ass. I don\u2019t give a f***.\nHunte: And, just like that, Ashley goes from being this naive white woman who doesn\u2019t understand race in America to a white woman asking the police to remove her disappointing Black, immigrant husband from her life, and from her country.\nAshley: I don\u2019t want him near me. I don\u2019t even want him in this country. He\u2019s here illegally. He needs to go back to Jamaica.\n(Low percussive music plays.)\nHunte: Some of this ugliness\u2014this icky gender and racial dynamics, the heartbreak\u2014this is just classic reality-TV-show stuff. But this particular drama of the 90 days and the K-1 visa started way before reality TV.\nHunte: For one thing, I, you know, I just kind of looked at the Wikipedia history of the K-1 visa, and I was kind of surprised to see that [Chuckles.] the Vietnam War had something to do with it.\nSchaeffer: Yeah. I mean, it actually has a lot longer history, I would say, than the Vietnam War.\nHunte: After the break, how love got turned into a visa application.\n(A moment of synthesizer melody plays above the percussive music, followed by the break.)\n(A quick, goofy musical flourish.)\nHunte: The journey to 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 is a long and winding one. As much as it\u2019s a story about love across borders, it\u2019s also a mini-drama about who we think is worthy of marriage and citizenship, and who has the power to decide. Felicity Amaya Schaeffer\u2014she\u2019s the professor at UC Santa Cruz who did research on so-called romance tours\u2014told us that one of the earliest immigration laws ever passed in the U.S. was about romance, or, at least, sex.\nSchaeffer: From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race.\u00a0\nHunte: The law was called the Page Act, passed in 1875. It restricted the migration of Asian laborers to the United States for, quote, \u201cimmoral purposes.\u201d And it was primarily enforced against Chinese immigrants\u2014but, more specifically, Chinese women.\nSchaeffer: If you were the wife of a wealthy Chinese merchant, you could come to the United States. But, if you were a lower-class woman, you could not come. And this has to do with trying to prevent laborers from migrating and bringing women that they thought would destroy the values of the United States.\u00a0\nHunte: U.S. lawmakers assumed that poor Chinese women coming to the United States were coming here to be sex workers.\nSchaeffer: This created some of the legislation that women had to have medical examinations before migrating.\nHunte: Why were they having them do medical exams?\nSchaeffer: Chinese women were assumed to spread venereal diseases because they were assumed to be prostitutes. Women had to have that kind of medical exam before they were allowed entry.\n(Light, ringing synthesizer music seems to travel back in time.)\nHunte: The law was eventually changed to allow more foreign women into the United States, but that\u2019s because American men demanded it. Starting with the Philippines War in the late 1800s, American men were going all over the world, fighting wars and colonizing\u2014and, in the meantime, meeting women they wanted to bring back to the U.S. and marry.\nAfter World War II, thousands of American men wanted to bring women back from Europe and Asia, but couldn\u2019t, because of immigration quotas. So Congress passed the War Brides Act.\nSchaeffer: This was a kind of pathway for men to bring back wives. And there was, like, 300,000 women that came.\nHunte: It made it easier to bring the spouses of American military members back to the U.S. But the War Brides Act was only in effect for about three years\u20141945 to 1948. And as the Vietnam War began to wind down, American soldiers\u2014who, once again, wanted to bring more foreign wives back to the U.S.\u2014started demanding a more permanent solution.\nSchaeffer: So 1970 was when the K-1 process was actually finalized.\u00a0\nHunte: But the relatively clear, simple, and quick path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship offered by the K-1 visa has alarmed American politicians over the years, and led to panics about marriage fraud.\nSchaeffer: There were all kinds of media accounts about these sort of marriage-ring frauds that were allowing people to come in from Havana, and all these subversive types that were using marriage as a way to sort of skirt the usual immigration structures and enter into the country. And I think during the wars, it was a more clear understanding of how people met, and the conditions through which people met.\nHunte: So the soldiers were going overseas, falling in love, bringing women back. Now, when in the absence of that, it\u2019s like, \u201cWait, why are these women coming here?\u201d\nSchaeffer: Mhm, mhm! [Hunte laughs.] Yeah! Yeah. \u201cWhat is their motivation for coming here?\u201d I think that\u2019s the next big phase, is already the presumption of fraud after the Vietnam War.\nSenator Alan Simpson: We\u2019re going to examine this issue of immigration marriage fraud.\u00a0\nHunte: Resulting in things like this: a Senate committee hearing on marriage fraud in 1985. Here\u2019s Senator Alan Simpson.\nSimpson: We\u2019re going to inquire into the nature and extent of this situation, determine whether we see but another way of gimmicking our generous\u2014very generous\u2014legal immigration laws.\nHunte: And this led to a new immigration law. It made the green card immigrants got after they got married conditional. You didn\u2019t get a permanent green card until after you\u2019d been married for at least two years.\nSuspicion of immigrants continued well into the \u201990s, but the narrative changed to one where immigrants were now an economic liability.\nSchaeffer: Because, you know, that\u2019s always the language about immigrants, right? That they\u2019re a drain on the economy, that they\u2019re always taking from and, you know, using these precious resources that should go to citizens.\nHunte: So the K-1 visa changed again. In 1996, President Clinton signed a new rule into law. Starting now, Americans who brought a spouse to the U.S. on the K-1 visa were now legally responsible for that person for 10 years.\nSchaeffer: Even if they divorce, he is taking up responsibility to make sure that she can live\u2014even without a job\u2014for the remainder of 10 years while in this country, if she decides to stay.\nHunte: Wow. Yeah, that is\u2014that is a huge shift.\u00a0\nSchaeffer: Yeah!\nHunte: That\u2019s huge.\u00a0\nSchaeffer: Yeah.\nHunte: It sounds like it\u2019s to discourage people from doing this, is what it sounds like.\nSchaeffer: Yes. That is an entirely huge shift, and men came to me complaining about that [Laughs.] over and over again.\nHunte: As part of her research, Felicity spent a lot of time on listservs for men interested in marrying foreign women. When this rule was put into place, she watched as they began to freak out, asking each other about potential red flags.\nSchaeffer: It was everything from, you know, \u201dShe doesn\u2019t want to have sex \u2019til we get married. Is this a red flag?\u201d \u201cIs she affectionate enough?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIs she, uh, hot and sexy in bed?\u201d Like, \u201cDoes she ask for money?\u201d That was a big one that would come up.\nAnd so, then, women, you know, didn\u2019t have the benefit of this kind of community, but would often talk to me, like, \u201cI feel, really, like I can\u2019t ask him for things that I need, because he seems so suspicious of me.\u201d\u00a0\nHunte: Mmm.\nSchaeffer: So, you know, it really did affect, um, what they could say to each other, how they would read each other\u2019s actions.\nHunte: Felicity says the threat of financial consequences for a bad marriage with a foreign spouse may have made these kinds of relationships even more tense.\nSchaeffer: And so I think that part of that shift in the K-1 visa structure led to, actually\u2014or maybe facilitated\u2014more abusive relationships, because the men were so skeptical and sort of adopting the view of the state.\n(A heavy synthesizer whistle plays over a windswept musical landscape.)\nHunte: In 2000, Anastasia King, a 19-year-old originally from Kyrgyzstan, was murdered by her American husband after she was brought to the U.S. on the K-1 visa. It\u2019s impossible to say for certain whether the pressure and suspicion that increased after changes to the K-1 visa increased the level of violence in these kinds of relationships. But, in response to this abuse, Congress realized it also had to protect immigrant spouses. So it passed the International Marriage Brokerage Regulation Act, or IMBRA, in 2005.\nSchaeffer: Where men have to provide criminal records, and women have to have their rights.\nHunte: I spoke to a couple of immigration attorneys who told me immigrant women are still afraid that, if they report their American husbands for abuse, they\u2019ll be deported\u2014though there are provisions within IMBRA and the Violence Against Women Act to protect them. Even still, women in the U.S. on the K-1 visa, separated from family and community and unable to legally work, are often left vulnerable.\n(A beat.)\nHunte: Today, as part of the K-1 application process, the foreign fianc\u00e9 has to sit for an interview with an American consular official who\u2019s trying to find out whether your relationship is real or a scam. You\u2019re asked about your American partner\u2019s birthday, education, family\u2014but you\u2019re also asked to maybe describe your engagement, or whether you\u2019re planning to go on a honeymoon, or what kind of wedding you\u2019re going to have. In other words, are you here for the right reasons? Do you really love this person?\n(Heavy music plays.)\nJohn, Colt\u2019s cousin: How do you express your love to Colt?\nLarissa: To show love? For me, it\u2019s clean the house.\n(The music continues under the narration.)\nHunte: Those interviews with consular officials are never caught on camera. But you can kind of get an idea of how they might go, watching friends and family on 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 question the would-be foreign spouse. Here\u2019s Colt\u2019s cousin, John, asking Larissa to prove she loves Colt.\n(The heavy music continues.)\nJohn: You\u2019re not just coming over here to marry my man for a green card, are ya?\nLarissa: I\u2019m with him because I love him.\n(The music changes tone, like an investigative journalist intro on a late-night news show.)\nLarissa: (In a confessional interview.) Honestly, John was acting like he\u2019s policy or immigration officer. He was really rude to me.\n(The news-show music fades out.)\nSchaeffer: The United States is about choice and equality and democracy. So it\u2019s interesting to think about how romance sort of sits in for all of these other values of a democracy. Like, are you capable of consenting to this? Or, if you come from a poor background, are you forced into this because you have no other recourse? That you really choose this person because you love them, and not for any other reasons. So it\u2019s this sort of divorcing of economic questions from romantic ones.\n(Soft, pensive electric guitar plays over lo-fi electronica. The word Lovesick repeats periodically, like a whisper.)\nHunte: So, Julia, what do you think?\nLongoria: I mean, [Laughs.] this is, like, what\u2019s so appealing and repulsing about reality TV, right? Watching this desperation on all sides play out like a car accident, you know? Are they here for the right reasons? Will they actually be truly in love?\nHunte: You know, there are, like, some couples on the show where it\u2019s kind of obvious that the foreign fianc\u00e9 is, like, only here for that person, and it kind of plays out in these funny ways. Like, I\u2019m thinking about this one couple from the most recent season\u2014Jovi and Yara\u2014and Yara is from the Ukraine, and Jovi is an American guy from New Orleans. And they\u2019re having a fight on the street, and, at one point, Jovi says, \u201cOh, what? You\u2019re just going to go back to the Ukraine?\u201d and she just looks at him and says, \u201cYeah! I\u2019ll go back. I had a really nice life there!\u201d And you can see that she\u2019s, like, not here on a lark. She\u2019s not here because she thinks that the United States is better than the Ukraine. She actually, you know\u2014and she knows there\u2019s a stereotype about eastern European women, and she\u2019s rejecting that. She\u2019s just literally here to be with this guy. So I just also like this show because it\u2019s always questioning your assumptions about people and what their motivations might be.\nLongoria: Yeah! And it kind of raises the question, like, what are the \u201cright reasons\u201d to be in this kind of relationship\u2014\nHunte: Yeah!\nLongoria: \u2014or, really, any, right? (Chuckles.)\nHunte: And why does the American government even care that much? [Both laugh.] You know, if people are scamming, let them scam each other and fall in love. That\u2019s all I have to say! (Laughs.)\n(Upbeat, bubblegum techno music plays up.)\nHunte: I already think I know the answer to this question, but, Julia, do you think you will watch 90 Day Fianc\u00e9? (Bursts out laughing, and Longoria laughs too.)\nLongoria: I mean, you watched it so I don\u2019t have to!\nHunte: Alright! Fair enough, fair enough.

            "contentSnippet": "Dating shows often push contestants to extreme measures in pursuit of love. Reality-show producers will impose fake deadlines, physical obstacles, and manufactured drama to create the juiciest spectacle. But on TLC\u2019s 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, a high-stakes and wildly popular reality show, the producers didn\u2019t need to dream up a deadline: It\u2019s a requirement of the rigorous U.S. visa-application process.\u00a0\nThe show follows real-life couples pursuing a K-1 visa\u2014the \u201cfianc\u00e9 visa\u201d\u2014which allows a U.S. citizen\u2019s foreign partner to enter the U.S. legally, but only for 90 days, the deadline by which they must get married. The show documents the complications of those emotionally charged 90 days, when two people from different countries, cultures, and sometimes races have to decide whether their relationship is real.\n\u201cFrom the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race as it\u2019s intersecting with class and sexuality,\u201d says Felicity Amaya Schaeffer, a professor of feminist studies and critical race studies at UC Santa Cruz.\nBe part of The Experiment.

It\u2019s a little bit long\u2014it\u2019s like seven minutes or so\u2014\u2019cause this is your first time watching 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, anything having to do with 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, right?\nJulia Longoria: That\u2019s correct.\nHunte: Okay, okay.\nLongoria: I\u2019m just curious, like, why are you interested in this? Like, why should someone care?\nHunte: (Insistently.) Watch the clip, Julia! (Laughs, and Longoria joins in.)\n(Music shifts into long, sustained notes to build drama.)\nLongoria: We start today with correspondent Tracie Hunte guiding me into the unknown: the world of reality TV.\n(A dramatic but upbeat musical flourish plays, like the intro to a theme song, before moving back to the plucky, quirky music.)\nHunte: Okay. So, Julia, 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 is a wildly popular show on TLC. It\u2019s about couples who are international\u2014like, it\u2019s usually one person lives in America, and the other person lives somewhere overseas\u2014and I want to begin your 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 journey with one couple in particular: Colt and Larissa.\nLongoria: Okay. I\u2019m gonna\u2014do I hit play?\nHunte: Yes. Hit play!\nColt: My name is Colt. I\u2019m 33 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nHunte: We are in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we\u2019re at the airport, and we\u2019re meeting Colt and Larissa. Colt is a white guy in his 30s. He lives in Las Vegas.\u00a0\nLarissa: I am Larissa, 31 years old, from Minas Gerais, Brazil.\nHunte: And Larissa is from Brazil. She is also in her 30s. And they met online. They went on vacation together\u2014to Cancun, I think\u2014and after five days of this vacation together, Colt asked Larissa to marry him. And so she said yes.\nLongoria: After one date they decided to get married?\nHunte: Yes, effectively one date. So what we\u2019re doing right now is that we\u2019re meeting Larissa for the first time. She\u2019s just flown into Las Vegas, and this scene is basically her first impressions.\nLongoria: First impressions of Las Vegas, right?\nHunte: Yes.\u00a0\nLarissa: Here is hot.\u00a0\nColt: I don\u2019t have air-conditioning. [A chuckle.] It\u2019s going to get a little hotter too.\u00a0\nLarissa: Oh my. I can feel the hot, warm.\nHunte: First of all, she\u2019s hot. [Longoria chuckles.] It\u2019s not the same sort of warmth in Brazil. I\u2019ve been to Brazil; I know the difference between desert heat and beach heat, [Both laugh.] and I know which one I vastly prefer.\nLarissa: My first goal in America is marry. Second, apply for the green card. And third, buy a car with air conditioner. [Laughs.]\n(A beat.)\nLarissa: I thought that was more big, you know.\nColt: It\u2019s pretty big.\nLarissa: Like New York.\n(Up-tempo, jazzy, big-city ambience plays.)\nHunte: Las Vegas is also this thing that\u2019s exported to the rest of the world through our movies and television shows\u2014Ocean\u2019s 11. Like, you get this idea that it\u2019s this glamorous, glitzy, big city, you know, \u201cAmerican dreams.\u201d\u00a0\nLongoria: Totally.\nHunte: Blah, blah, blah.\nLongoria: Totally. Tall buildings, big lights.\nHunte: Yeah.\nLongoria: Like, casinos.\nHunte: Exactly.\nLarissa: My first impressions of Las Vegas? Not a city I expected. I confused Las Vegas with Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York. It\u2019s not like the\u2014the movies.\nHunte: And so you see her, like, get out of the car. She\u2019s still very hot. She\u2019s still very uncomfortable. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, here\u2019s the sign!\u201d And this is the world-famous Las Vegas sign. It\u2019s on postcards, it\u2019s on magnets, it\u2019s everywhere. And it was actually surprising to me, \u2019cause I also didn\u2019t realize it was that small. (Laughs.)\nColt: Are you going back to Brazil? (Chuckles.)\nLarissa: No, no! I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s\u2014here\u2019s so warm.\u00a0\nColt: Yeah?\nLarissa: (Sighs.) Not in my American dream.\u00a0\nColt: This is America.\n(Melodramatic, heavy piano music plays for a moment.)\nHunte: So yeah. I think that there\u2019s just a lot more going on here other than just, like, a disappointed woman coming from Brazil. I think it\u2019s, like, way bigger than that.\u00a0\n(A musical descent pulls us into a dreamlike tapestry of synthesizers and percussion.)\nLongoria: Okay, back me up for a second. Why is the show called 90 Day Fianc\u00e9?\nHunte: Well, it\u2019s called 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 because, if you\u2019re an American person who wants to marry somebody from another country and you want to bring them to the United States, you can bring them to the United States on something called a K-1 visa, or a fianc\u00e9 visa. And that gives that person permission to come to the United States to get married, but they have to do it within 90 days.\u00a0\nAnd so\u2014at least, how it functions in the world of the TV show; I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for a lot of couples\u2014you\u2019re going to spend those 90 days not only planning a wedding, but just, like, getting to know each other better, and figuring out whether or not you could actually live together, and whether or not this is what you want to go through with.\nLongoria: So what you\u2019re saying, like, 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 is a TV show based around this one piece\u2014or, really, like, this one clause\u2014in U.S. immigration policy?\nHunte: Yes.\nLongoria: I\u2014I did not realize that. [Hunte laughs.] Like, I guess I\u2019ve always \u2026 The thing I don\u2019t like about reality shows is that, like, they\u2019re sort of contrived. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, 90 days to fall in love.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way the world works.\u201d But, in this case, it is. [Both laugh.] It literally is how the world works. Like, the U.S. government came up with this premise.\u00a0\nHunte: Yes! Yes. And, Julia, because you haven\u2019t been watching reality TV, you\u2019ve been missing a very important lesson about U.S. immigration policy. [Both laugh.] And I think this show is also, like, a really good textbook example of Americans\u2019 relationship with the world, and how the world sees Americans.\n(Tonal shift: The music loops over the same few notes, hovering.)\nLongoria: This week, correspondent Tracie Hunte, our resident reality-TV expert, watches one of the biggest shows on television and tells the story of how love got written into U.S. immigration law.\u00a0\nI\u2019m Julia Longoria. This is The Experiment.\n(The notes hover for a moment more before cutting out.)\nHunte: Okay. So, new couple. This is Big Ed.\nBig Ed: I\u2019m Ed. I\u2019m 54 years old. People know me as \u201cBig Ed.\u201d\n(Fast-paced plucky guitar music plays.)\nBig Ed: I\u2019m from San Diego, California. [A camera shutter clicks.] And I am a professional photographer.\nHunte: Big Ed, American white man in his 50s. He actually gave himself the name \u201cBig Ed.\u201d\nBig Ed: It\u2019s funny because I\u2019m not tall. I am actually 4\u201911.\nHunte: And then there\u2019s Rose, who is much younger. She\u2019s 23.\n(Whimsical, reality-TV-show-style music plays, ostensibly to play up the comedy of the circumstances.)\nRose Vega: My name is Rose, and I am 23 years old. I\u2019m live in Caloocan City, Philippines.\nHunte: They met on Facebook, and they\u2019ve had their relationship just on Facebook, and, like, texting and calling. And he\u2019s traveling to the Philippines to meet her and her family\u2014and hopefully fall ever more deeply in love with her, and ask her to marry him.\nLongoria: Yeah, okay. (Laughs.)\nBig Ed: I spent the night at Rose\u2019s home.\nHunte: And in this scene, Big Ed is waking up after spending the night in Rose\u2019s house.\nBig Ed: And this was one of the worst nights of my life. I\u2019m completely drained. I haven\u2019t slept. The mattress that I slept in was soaking wet. This was the first night I\u2019ve ever spent without access to air-conditioning. And I hated it. And I feel broken.\n(Music fades out.)\nLongoria: (As Hunte giggles.) This is just so, so deeply uncomfortable to watch.\nHunte: So, like, a lot of this show is cringe. I should just say.\nLongoria: Yeah. So walk me through what\u2019s happening here.\nHunte: So, throughout the time that he\u2019s in the Philippines, there\u2019s, like, a scene where he\u2019s asking her to shave her legs, because he doesn\u2019t find her feminine enough for him. Or he makes a comment about her breath and gives her toothpaste and a toothbrush, but then it comes out that she actually has had an ulcer for many years, and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing her breath, and she\u2019s actually self-conscious about it, and she brushes her teeth all the time. But, on top of all that, Ed travels to the Philippines from San Diego\u2014something like six, seven thousand miles. And he goes because he\u2019s gonna rescue Rose from this situation, this poverty that she\u2019s in. And he\u2019s already been doing that. He\u2019s been, like, sending money to her and her family to help them out. But, from the second that he\u2019s in the Philippines, he\u2019s so completely helpless, and she\u2019s the one that ends up having to rescue him this entire trip.\nWhy I find this so interesting is just, you know, to see this kind of power dynamic play out. And, also, like, it\u2019s just also really interesting to see the disconnect between how Americans see themselves and how the rest of the world sees Americans.\n(Soft, lo-fi music plays.)\nHunte: And so on this show, you see men like Big Ed. They say they lost hope that they could ever find a partner in the U.S., so they turned to international dating. And this is not just, like, some bizarre reality-TV show setup. Like, there\u2019s a whole industry built around this kind of relationship.\n(Music out.)\nFelicity Amaya Schaeffer: Marriage is one of those ways in which women have\u2014for many, many generations and decades\u2014used marriage to get ahead.\u00a0\nHunte: Felicity Amaya Schaeffer is a professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race Studies at UC Santa Cruz. She\u2019s also the author of the book Love and Empire. Way before 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, Felicity became interested in how immigrants were using marriage to cross the border into the U.S. Over three years, she talked to dozens of men and women who were interested in these kinds of relationships.\nSchaeffer: I ended up in Colombia and Mexico, interviewing women and men at these vacation romance tours about why they were interested in dating someone. Um \u2026\nHunte: Wait, what\u2019s a \u201cvacation romance tour\u201d? (Schaeffer chuckles lightly while Hunte laughs outright.)\nSchaeffer: So, that is, um, these sort of big social parties that different companies host so that men from the United States and Canada can travel to Latin American countries and meet women in a big social event.\n(Lightly bouncy music plays.)\nHunte: So here\u2019s what Felicity discovered. Say you\u2019re a woman in a foreign country interested in marrying an American man. You might contact one of these international dating sites, and they\u2019ll get some photos of you and include some of your stats.\nSchaeffer: Their weight, how tall they are\u2014all kinds of personal information\u2014and then their contact.\nHunte: The company then compiles these packages filled with these photos and contact info for all these women into these digital catalogs, and American men can look through them. And if they see someone they like, they could email them.\nSchaeffer: And then, usually, they\u2019ll all come together for these big sort of social parties. And it\u2019s a quick way to meet lots of women and for the women to be introduced to lots of men, all in one place.\u00a0\nHunte: Which is where Felicity would show up, asking questions.\nSchaeffer: Part of this that I\u2019m also interested in is the fantasies that foreign women usually have of life in the United States, and vice versa.\nYou know, men sort of think that U.S. women are much too feminist and too modern and too independent. And they think that they\u2019re gonna find something very different in Russia, Latin America\u2014you know, wherever it is\u2014Asia. And so they often are surprised that women, um, are very strong, have strong personalities, they need certain things, and that they don\u2019t want to usually live in rural areas.\nHunte: Did you peer into the dark heart of American masculinity?\nSchaeffer: Yes.\nHunte: What\u2019d you see when you looked\u2014when you peered it into it? (Laughs.)\nSchaeffer: Oh my God, I mean, so many insecurities! Given the way in which desire is so entwined with status and money, you know, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a sad structure, that sort of capitalist context in which certain people become no one if you don\u2019t have some game.\u00a0\nI have this amazing interview with a guy who said to me something that really clarified things. He said, \u201cYou know, in the United States, I\u2019m just the average Joe. But when I cross the border, I become Tom Cruise.\u201d\u00a0\nIt was hard, in some ways, and I felt really creepy. And then it was also sad, you know, to see that there\u2019s so many lonely people that are just sort of in the shadows, um, that can\u2019t meet anyone and just, like, really want to connect.\nHunte: Hmm.\nSchaeffer: And these women are just desperate to come to the United States. And that the men, in some ways, broker their ticket to getting here.\u00a0\nHunte: Have you ever watched 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, or heard about it?\nSchaeffer: Yes. I have watched some of the episodes, of course! (Laughs.)\nHunte: You watched it. Okay.\u00a0\nSchaeffer: It\u2019s hard to watch too many.\nColt: (Over funky music.) I never thought I would get married. All my previous relationships have ended with me getting a broken heart. (The funky music continues under Hunte\u2019s narration.)\nHunte: Watching 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, I got this feeling that, for a lot of the cast, they might actually believe that a shot at the American dream is all they have to offer in exchange for love. Here\u2019s Colt, the guy who lives in Las Vegas.\nColt: (Over the funky music again.) After having struck out a few times online with American girls, I thought maybe I could search outside the country, maybe find a girl. (The music fades out.)\nHunte: But, as Americans put themselves on the international marriage market hoping to find someone more beautiful, more loyal, more grateful, if that love turns out not to be true, they also have the power to take that American dream away \u2026 Which brings me to one couple I think about a lot: Ashley and Jay.\nAshley: (Over soft-rock acoustic guitar.) My name is Ashley. I\u2019m 31 years old, and I\u2019m from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.\nHunte: Ashley is in her 30s. She\u2019s white, blond, pretty, and a mother of two from Mechanicsburg, a town in Pennsylvania where more than 90 percent of the residents are white.\u00a0\nWhile vacationing in Jamaica, she meets Jay, a Black, 20-year-old tattoo artist.\nAshley: (Over lightly techno music.) I went to Jamaica with a group of friends and family to a big wedding. And, um, one night we decided to go out to a bar, and that\u2019s where I met Jay.\nHunte: Ashley says she\u2019s been cheated on before, and Jay more or less admits that being faithful is hard for him. But when he proposes, she says yes. They file for the K-1 visa, and soon he\u2019s on a plane, traveling to live with her in America.\u00a0\nBut Ashley admits that she hasn\u2019t really thought about what that might mean for Jay, to live in a mostly white suburb.\nAshley: (Over slightly tense music.) I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t have to deal with any racial issues, but I\u2019m also very naive to all of this.\nHunte: Ashley and Jay get married, but shortly after the wedding, she finds out he had sex with another woman. So she calls him on the phone to confront him.\nAshley: (The tense music continues, adding drama with each expletive.) If you show up at my house, the police will be waiting to deport your ass. I don\u2019t give a f***. I do not give a f***. He has to sit and rot in jail until they deport his ass. I don\u2019t give a f***.\nHunte: And, just like that, Ashley goes from being this naive white woman who doesn\u2019t understand race in America to a white woman asking the police to remove her disappointing Black, immigrant husband from her life, and from her country.\nAshley: I don\u2019t want him near me. I don\u2019t even want him in this country. He\u2019s here illegally. He needs to go back to Jamaica.\n(Low percussive music plays.)\nHunte: Some of this ugliness\u2014this icky gender and racial dynamics, the heartbreak\u2014this is just classic reality-TV-show stuff. But this particular drama of the 90 days and the K-1 visa started way before reality TV.\nHunte: For one thing, I, you know, I just kind of looked at the Wikipedia history of the K-1 visa, and I was kind of surprised to see that [Chuckles.] the Vietnam War had something to do with it.\nSchaeffer: Yeah. I mean, it actually has a lot longer history, I would say, than the Vietnam War.\nHunte: After the break, how love got turned into a visa application.\n(A moment of synthesizer melody plays above the percussive music, followed by the break.)\n(A quick, goofy musical flourish.)\nHunte: The journey to 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 is a long and winding one. As much as it\u2019s a story about love across borders, it\u2019s also a mini-drama about who we think is worthy of marriage and citizenship, and who has the power to decide. Felicity Amaya Schaeffer\u2014she\u2019s the professor at UC Santa Cruz who did research on so-called romance tours\u2014told us that one of the earliest immigration laws ever passed in the U.S. was about romance, or, at least, sex.\nSchaeffer: From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race.\u00a0\nHunte: The law was called the Page Act, passed in 1875. It restricted the migration of Asian laborers to the United States for, quote, \u201cimmoral purposes.\u201d And it was primarily enforced against Chinese immigrants\u2014but, more specifically, Chinese women.\nSchaeffer: If you were the wife of a wealthy Chinese merchant, you could come to the United States. But, if you were a lower-class woman, you could not come. And this has to do with trying to prevent laborers from migrating and bringing women that they thought would destroy the values of the United States.\u00a0\nHunte: U.S. lawmakers assumed that poor Chinese women coming to the United States were coming here to be sex workers.\nSchaeffer: This created some of the legislation that women had to have medical examinations before migrating.\nHunte: Why were they having them do medical exams?\nSchaeffer: Chinese women were assumed to spread venereal diseases because they were assumed to be prostitutes. Women had to have that kind of medical exam before they were allowed entry.\n(Light, ringing synthesizer music seems to travel back in time.)\nHunte: The law was eventually changed to allow more foreign women into the United States, but that\u2019s because American men demanded it. Starting with the Philippines War in the late 1800s, American men were going all over the world, fighting wars and colonizing\u2014and, in the meantime, meeting women they wanted to bring back to the U.S. and marry.\nAfter World War II, thousands of American men wanted to bring women back from Europe and Asia, but couldn\u2019t, because of immigration quotas. So Congress passed the War Brides Act.\nSchaeffer: This was a kind of pathway for men to bring back wives. And there was, like, 300,000 women that came.\nHunte: It made it easier to bring the spouses of American military members back to the U.S. But the War Brides Act was only in effect for about three years\u20141945 to 1948. And as the Vietnam War began to wind down, American soldiers\u2014who, once again, wanted to bring more foreign wives back to the U.S.\u2014started demanding a more permanent solution.\nSchaeffer: So 1970 was when the K-1 process was actually finalized.\u00a0\nHunte: But the relatively clear, simple, and quick path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship offered by the K-1 visa has alarmed American politicians over the years, and led to panics about marriage fraud.\nSchaeffer: There were all kinds of media accounts about these sort of marriage-ring frauds that were allowing people to come in from Havana, and all these subversive types that were using marriage as a way to sort of skirt the usual immigration structures and enter into the country. And I think during the wars, it was a more clear understanding of how people met, and the conditions through which people met.\nHunte: So the soldiers were going overseas, falling in love, bringing women back. Now, when in the absence of that, it\u2019s like, \u201cWait, why are these women coming here?\u201d\nSchaeffer: Mhm, mhm! [Hunte laughs.] Yeah! Yeah. \u201cWhat is their motivation for coming here?\u201d I think that\u2019s the next big phase, is already the presumption of fraud after the Vietnam War.\nSenator Alan Simpson: We\u2019re going to examine this issue of immigration marriage fraud.\u00a0\nHunte: Resulting in things like this: a Senate committee hearing on marriage fraud in 1985. Here\u2019s Senator Alan Simpson.\nSimpson: We\u2019re going to inquire into the nature and extent of this situation, determine whether we see but another way of gimmicking our generous\u2014very generous\u2014legal immigration laws.\nHunte: And this led to a new immigration law. It made the green card immigrants got after they got married conditional. You didn\u2019t get a permanent green card until after you\u2019d been married for at least two years.\nSuspicion of immigrants continued well into the \u201990s, but the narrative changed to one where immigrants were now an economic liability.\nSchaeffer: Because, you know, that\u2019s always the language about immigrants, right? That they\u2019re a drain on the economy, that they\u2019re always taking from and, you know, using these precious resources that should go to citizens.\nHunte: So the K-1 visa changed again. In 1996, President Clinton signed a new rule into law. Starting now, Americans who brought a spouse to the U.S. on the K-1 visa were now legally responsible for that person for 10 years.\nSchaeffer: Even if they divorce, he is taking up responsibility to make sure that she can live\u2014even without a job\u2014for the remainder of 10 years while in this country, if she decides to stay.\nHunte: Wow. Yeah, that is\u2014that is a huge shift.\u00a0\nSchaeffer: Yeah!\nHunte: That\u2019s huge.\u00a0\nSchaeffer: Yeah.\nHunte: It sounds like it\u2019s to discourage people from doing this, is what it sounds like.\nSchaeffer: Yes. That is an entirely huge shift, and men came to me complaining about that [Laughs.] over and over again.\nHunte: As part of her research, Felicity spent a lot of time on listservs for men interested in marrying foreign women. When this rule was put into place, she watched as they began to freak out, asking each other about potential red flags.\nSchaeffer: It was everything from, you know, \u201dShe doesn\u2019t want to have sex \u2019til we get married. Is this a red flag?\u201d \u201cIs she affectionate enough?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIs she, uh, hot and sexy in bed?\u201d Like, \u201cDoes she ask for money?\u201d That was a big one that would come up.\nAnd so, then, women, you know, didn\u2019t have the benefit of this kind of community, but would often talk to me, like, \u201cI feel, really, like I can\u2019t ask him for things that I need, because he seems so suspicious of me.\u201d\u00a0\nHunte: Mmm.\nSchaeffer: So, you know, it really did affect, um, what they could say to each other, how they would read each other\u2019s actions.\nHunte: Felicity says the threat of financial consequences for a bad marriage with a foreign spouse may have made these kinds of relationships even more tense.\nSchaeffer: And so I think that part of that shift in the K-1 visa structure led to, actually\u2014or maybe facilitated\u2014more abusive relationships, because the men were so skeptical and sort of adopting the view of the state.\n(A heavy synthesizer whistle plays over a windswept musical landscape.)\nHunte: In 2000, Anastasia King, a 19-year-old originally from Kyrgyzstan, was murdered by her American husband after she was brought to the U.S. on the K-1 visa. It\u2019s impossible to say for certain whether the pressure and suspicion that increased after changes to the K-1 visa increased the level of violence in these kinds of relationships. But, in response to this abuse, Congress realized it also had to protect immigrant spouses. So it passed the International Marriage Brokerage Regulation Act, or IMBRA, in 2005.\nSchaeffer: Where men have to provide criminal records, and women have to have their rights.\nHunte: I spoke to a couple of immigration attorneys who told me immigrant women are still afraid that, if they report their American husbands for abuse, they\u2019ll be deported\u2014though there are provisions within IMBRA and the Violence Against Women Act to protect them. Even still, women in the U.S. on the K-1 visa, separated from family and community and unable to legally work, are often left vulnerable.\n(A beat.)\nHunte: Today, as part of the K-1 application process, the foreign fianc\u00e9 has to sit for an interview with an American consular official who\u2019s trying to find out whether your relationship is real or a scam. You\u2019re asked about your American partner\u2019s birthday, education, family\u2014but you\u2019re also asked to maybe describe your engagement, or whether you\u2019re planning to go on a honeymoon, or what kind of wedding you\u2019re going to have. In other words, are you here for the right reasons? Do you really love this person?\n(Heavy music plays.)\nJohn, Colt\u2019s cousin: How do you express your love to Colt?\nLarissa: To show love? For me, it\u2019s clean the house.\n(The music continues under the narration.)\nHunte: Those interviews with consular officials are never caught on camera. But you can kind of get an idea of how they might go, watching friends and family on 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 question the would-be foreign spouse. Here\u2019s Colt\u2019s cousin, John, asking Larissa to prove she loves Colt.\n(The heavy music continues.)\nJohn: You\u2019re not just coming over here to marry my man for a green card, are ya?\nLarissa: I\u2019m with him because I love him.\n(The music changes tone, like an investigative journalist intro on a late-night news show.)\nLarissa: (In a confessional interview.) Honestly, John was acting like he\u2019s policy or immigration officer. He was really rude to me.\n(The news-show music fades out.)\nSchaeffer: The United States is about choice and equality and democracy. So it\u2019s interesting to think about how romance sort of sits in for all of these other values of a democracy. Like, are you capable of consenting to this? Or, if you come from a poor background, are you forced into this because you have no other recourse? That you really choose this person because you love them, and not for any other reasons. So it\u2019s this sort of divorcing of economic questions from romantic ones.\n(Soft, pensive electric guitar plays over lo-fi electronica. The word Lovesick repeats periodically, like a whisper.)\nHunte: So, Julia, what do you think?\nLongoria: I mean, [Laughs.] this is, like, what\u2019s so appealing and repulsing about reality TV, right? Watching this desperation on all sides play out like a car accident, you know? Are they here for the right reasons? Will they actually be truly in love?\nHunte: You know, there are, like, some couples on the show where it\u2019s kind of obvious that the foreign fianc\u00e9 is, like, only here for that person, and it kind of plays out in these funny ways. Like, I\u2019m thinking about this one couple from the most recent season\u2014Jovi and Yara\u2014and Yara is from the Ukraine, and Jovi is an American guy from New Orleans. And they\u2019re having a fight on the street, and, at one point, Jovi says, \u201cOh, what? You\u2019re just going to go back to the Ukraine?\u201d and she just looks at him and says, \u201cYeah! I\u2019ll go back. I had a really nice life there!\u201d And you can see that she\u2019s, like, not here on a lark. She\u2019s not here because she thinks that the United States is better than the Ukraine. She actually, you know\u2014and she knows there\u2019s a stereotype about eastern European women, and she\u2019s rejecting that. She\u2019s just literally here to be with this guy. So I just also like this show because it\u2019s always questioning your assumptions about people and what their motivations might be.\nLongoria: Yeah! And it kind of raises the question, like, what are the \u201cright reasons\u201d to be in this kind of relationship\u2014\nHunte: Yeah!\nLongoria: \u2014or, really, any, right? (Chuckles.)\nHunte: And why does the American government even care that much? [Both laugh.] You know, if people are scamming, let them scam each other and fall in love. That\u2019s all I have to say! (Laughs.)\n(Upbeat, bubblegum techno music plays up.)\nHunte: I already think I know the answer to this question, but, Julia, do you think you will watch 90 Day Fianc\u00e9? (Bursts out laughing, and Longoria laughs too.)\nLongoria: I mean, you watched it so I don\u2019t have to!\nHunte: Alright! Fair enough, fair enough. (Laughs lightly.)\n(The bubblegum music plays up.)\nGabrielle Berbey: This episode was produced by Tracie Hunte and me, Gabrielle Berbey, with editing by Katherine Wells, Emily Botein, and Julia Longoria.

Reality-show producers will impose fake deadlines, physical obstacles, and manufactured drama to create the juiciest spectacle. But on TLC\u2019s 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, a high-stakes and wildly popular reality show, the producers didn\u2019t need to dream up a deadline: It\u2019s a requirement of the rigorous U.S. visa-application process.\u00a0 The show follows real-life couples pursuing a K-1 visa\u2014the \u201cfianc\u00e9 visa\u201d\u2014which allows a U.S. citizen\u2019s foreign partner to enter the U.S. legally, but only for 90 days, the deadline by which they must get married. The show documents the complications of those emotionally charged 90 days, when two people from different countries, cultures, and sometimes races have to decide whether their relationship is real. \u201cFrom the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race as it\u2019s intersecting with class and sexuality,\u201d says Felicity Amaya Schaeffer, a professor of feminist studies and critical race studies at UC Santa Cruz.

Tracie Hunte: So, to begin, I am going to send you a link. It\u2019s a little bit long\u2014it\u2019s like seven minutes or so\u2014\u2019cause this is your first time watching 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, anything having to do with 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, right? Julia Longoria: That\u2019s correct. Hunte: Okay, okay. Longoria: I\u2019m just curious, like, why are you interested in this? Like, why should someone care? Hunte: (Insistently.) Watch the clip, Julia! (Laughs, and Longoria joins in.) (Music shifts into long, sustained notes to build drama.) Longoria: We start today with correspondent Tracie Hunte guiding me into the unknown: the world of reality TV. (A dramatic but upbeat musical flourish plays, like the intro to a theme song, before moving back to the plucky, quirky music.) Hunte: Okay. So, Julia, 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 is a wildly popular show on TLC. It\u2019s about couples who are international\u2014like, it\u2019s usually one person lives in America, and the other person lives somewhere overseas\u2014and I want to begin your 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 journey with one couple in particular: Colt and Larissa. Longoria: Okay. I\u2019m gonna\u2014do I hit play? Hunte: Yes. Hit play! Colt: My name is Colt. I\u2019m 33 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Hunte: We are in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we\u2019re at the airport, and we\u2019re meeting Colt and Larissa. Colt is a white guy in his 30s. He lives in Las Vegas.\u00a0 Larissa: I am Larissa, 31 years old, from Minas Gerais, Brazil. Hunte: And Larissa is from Brazil. She is also in her 30s. And they met online. They went on vacation together\u2014to Cancun, I think\u2014and after five days of this vacation together, Colt asked Larissa to marry him. And so she said yes. Longoria: After one date they decided to get married? Hunte: Yes, effectively one date. So what we\u2019re doing right now is that we\u2019re meeting Larissa for the first time. She\u2019s just flown into Las Vegas, and this scene is basically her first impressions. Longoria: First impressions of Las Vegas, right? Hunte: Yes.\u00a0 Larissa: Here is hot.\u00a0 Colt: I don\u2019t have air-conditioning. [A chuckle.] It\u2019s going to get a little hotter too.\u00a0 Larissa: Oh my. I can feel the hot, warm. Hunte: First of all, she\u2019s hot. [Longoria chuckles.] It\u2019s not the same sort of warmth in Brazil. I\u2019ve been to Brazil; I know the difference between desert heat and beach heat, [Both laugh.] and I know which one I vastly prefer. Larissa: My first goal in America is marry. Second, apply for the green card. And third, buy a car with air conditioner. [Laughs.] (A beat.) Larissa: I thought that was more big, you know. Colt: It\u2019s pretty big. Larissa: Like New York. (Up-tempo, jazzy, big-city ambience plays.) Hunte: Las Vegas is also this thing that\u2019s exported to the rest of the world through our movies and television shows\u2014Ocean\u2019s 11. Like, you get this idea that it\u2019s this glamorous, glitzy, big city, you know, \u201cAmerican dreams.\u201d\u00a0 Longoria: Totally. Hunte: Blah, blah, blah. Longoria: Totally. Tall buildings, big lights. Hunte: Yeah. Longoria: Like, casinos. Hunte: Exactly. Larissa: My first impressions of Las Vegas? Not a city I expected. I confused Las Vegas with Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York. It\u2019s not like the\u2014the movies. Hunte: And so you see her, like, get out of the car. She\u2019s still very hot. She\u2019s still very uncomfortable. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, here\u2019s the sign!\u201d And this is the world-famous Las Vegas sign. It\u2019s on postcards, it\u2019s on magnets, it\u2019s everywhere. And it was actually surprising to me, \u2019cause I also didn\u2019t realize it was that small. (Laughs.) Colt: Are you going back to Brazil? (Chuckles.) Larissa: No, no! I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s\u2014here\u2019s so warm.\u00a0 Colt: Yeah? Larissa: (Sighs.) Not in my American dream.\u00a0 Colt: This is America. (Melodramatic, heavy piano music plays for a moment.) Hunte: So yeah. I think that there\u2019s just a lot more going on here other than just, like, a disappointed woman coming from Brazil. I think it\u2019s, like, way bigger than that.\u00a0 (A musical descent pulls us into a dreamlike tapestry of synthesizers and percussion.) Longoria: Okay, back me up for a second. Why is the show called 90 Day Fianc\u00e9? Hunte: Well, it\u2019s called 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 because, if you\u2019re an American person who wants to marry somebody from another country and you want to bring them to the United States, you can bring them to the United States on something called a K-1 visa, or a fianc\u00e9 visa. And that gives that person permission to come to the United States to get married, but they have to do it within 90 days.\u00a0 And so\u2014at least, how it functions in the world of the TV show; I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for a lot of couples\u2014you\u2019re going to spend those 90 days not only planning a wedding, but just, like, getting to know each other better, and figuring out whether or not you could actually live together, and whether or not this is what you want to go through with. Longoria: So what you\u2019re saying, like, 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 is a TV show based around this one piece\u2014or, really, like, this one clause\u2014in U.S. immigration policy? Hunte: Yes. Longoria: I\u2014I did not realize that. [Hunte laughs.] Like, I guess I\u2019ve always \u2026 The thing I don\u2019t like about reality shows is that, like, they\u2019re sort of contrived. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, 90 days to fall in love.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way the world works.\u201d But, in this case, it is. [Both laugh.] It literally is how the world works. Like, the U.S. government came up with this premise.\u00a0 Hunte: Yes! Yes. And, Julia, because you haven\u2019t been watching reality TV, you\u2019ve been missing a very important lesson about U.S. immigration policy. [Both laugh.] And I think this show is also, like, a really good textbook example of Americans\u2019 relationship with the world, and how the world sees Americans. (Tonal shift: The music loops over the same few notes, hovering.) Longoria: This week, correspondent Tracie Hunte, our resident reality-TV expert, watches one of the biggest shows on television and tells the story of how love got written into U.S. immigration law.\u00a0 I\u2019m Julia Longoria. This is The Experiment. (The notes hover for a moment more before cutting out.) Hunte: Okay. So, new couple. This is Big Ed. Big Ed: I\u2019m Ed. I\u2019m 54 years old. People know me as \u201cBig Ed.\u201d (Fast-paced plucky guitar music plays.) Big Ed: I\u2019m from San Diego, California. [A camera shutter clicks.] And I am a professional photographer. Hunte: Big Ed, American white man in his 50s. He actually gave himself the name \u201cBig Ed.\u201d Big Ed: It\u2019s funny because I\u2019m not tall. I am actually 4\u201911. Hunte: And then there\u2019s Rose, who is much younger. She\u2019s 23. (Whimsical, reality-TV-show-style music plays, ostensibly to play up the comedy of the circumstances.) Rose Vega: My name is Rose, and I am 23 years old. I\u2019m live in Caloocan City, Philippines. Hunte: They met on Facebook, and they\u2019ve had their relationship just on Facebook, and, like, texting and calling. And he\u2019s traveling to the Philippines to meet her and her family\u2014and hopefully fall ever more deeply in love with her, and ask her to marry him. Longoria: Yeah, okay. (Laughs.) Big Ed: I spent the night at Rose\u2019s home. Hunte: And in this scene, Big Ed is waking up after spending the night in Rose\u2019s house. Big Ed: And this was one of the worst nights of my life. I\u2019m completely drained. I haven\u2019t slept. The mattress that I slept in was soaking wet. This was the first night I\u2019ve ever spent without access to air-conditioning. And I hated it. And I feel broken. (Music fades out.) Longoria: (As Hunte giggles.) This is just so, so deeply uncomfortable to watch. Hunte: So, like, a lot of this show is cringe. I should just say. Longoria: Yeah. So walk me through what\u2019s happening here. Hunte: So, throughout the time that he\u2019s in the Philippines, there\u2019s, like, a scene where he\u2019s asking her to shave her legs, because he doesn\u2019t find her feminine enough for him. Or he makes a comment about her breath and gives her toothpaste and a toothbrush, but then it comes out that she actually has had an ulcer for many years, and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing her breath, and she\u2019s actually self-conscious about it, and she brushes her teeth all the time. But, on top of all that, Ed travels to the Philippines from San Diego\u2014something like six, seven thousand miles. And he goes because he\u2019s gonna rescue Rose from this situation, this poverty that she\u2019s in. And he\u2019s already been doing that. He\u2019s been, like, sending money to her and her family to help them out. But, from the second that he\u2019s in the Philippines, he\u2019s so completely helpless, and she\u2019s the one that ends up having to rescue him this entire trip. Why I find this so interesting is just, you know, to see this kind of power dynamic play out. And, also, like, it\u2019s just also really interesting to see the disconnect between how Americans see themselves and how the rest of the world sees Americans. (Soft, lo-fi music plays.) Hunte: And so on this show, you see men like Big Ed. They say they lost hope that they could ever find a partner in the U.S., so they turned to international dating. And this is not just, like, some bizarre reality-TV show setup. Like, there\u2019s a whole industry built around this kind of relationship. (Music out.) Felicity Amaya Schaeffer: Marriage is one of those ways in which women have\u2014for many, many generations and decades\u2014used marriage to get ahead.\u00a0 Hunte: Felicity Amaya Schaeffer is a professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race Studies at UC Santa Cruz. She\u2019s also the author of the book Love and Empire. Way before 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, Felicity became interested in how immigrants were using marriage to cross the border into the U.S. Over three years, she talked to dozens of men and women who were interested in these kinds of relationships. Schaeffer: I ended up in Colombia and Mexico, interviewing women and men at these vacation romance tours about why they were interested in dating someone. Um \u2026 Hunte: Wait, what\u2019s a \u201cvacation romance tour\u201d? (Schaeffer chuckles lightly while Hunte laughs outright.) Schaeffer: So, that is, um, these sort of big social parties that different companies host so that men from the United States and Canada can travel to Latin American countries and meet women in a big social event. (Lightly bouncy music plays.) Hunte: So here\u2019s what Felicity discovered. Say you\u2019re a woman in a foreign country interested in marrying an American man. You might contact one of these international dating sites, and they\u2019ll get some photos of you and include some of your stats. Schaeffer: Their weight, how tall they are\u2014all kinds of personal information\u2014and then their contact. Hunte: The company then compiles these packages filled with these photos and contact info for all these women into these digital catalogs, and American men can look through them. And if they see someone they like, they could email them. Schaeffer: And then, usually, they\u2019ll all come together for these big sort of social parties. And it\u2019s a quick way to meet lots of women and for the women to be introduced to lots of men, all in one place.\u00a0 Hunte: Which is where Felicity would show up, asking questions. Schaeffer: Part of this that I\u2019m also interested in is the fantasies that foreign women usually have of life in the United States, and vice versa. You know, men sort of think that U.S. women are much too feminist and too modern and too independent. And they think that they\u2019re gonna find something very different in Russia, Latin America\u2014you know, wherever it is\u2014Asia. And so they often are surprised that women, um, are very strong, have strong personalities, they need certain things, and that they don\u2019t want to usually live in rural areas. Hunte: Did you peer into the dark heart of American masculinity? Schaeffer: Yes. Hunte: What\u2019d you see when you looked\u2014when you peered it into it? (Laughs.) Schaeffer: Oh my God, I mean, so many insecurities! Given the way in which desire is so entwined with status and money, you know, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a sad structure, that sort of capitalist context in which certain people become no one if you don\u2019t have some game.\u00a0 I have this amazing interview with a guy who said to me something that really clarified things. He said, \u201cYou know, in the United States, I\u2019m just the average Joe. But when I cross the border, I become Tom Cruise.\u201d\u00a0 It was hard, in some ways, and I felt really creepy. And then it was also sad, you know, to see that there\u2019s so many lonely people that are just sort of in the shadows, um, that can\u2019t meet anyone and just, like, really want to connect. Hunte: Hmm. Schaeffer: And these women are just desperate to come to the United States. And that the men, in some ways, broker their ticket to getting here.\u00a0 Hunte: Have you ever watched 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, or heard about it? Schaeffer: Yes. I have watched some of the episodes, of course! (Laughs.) Hunte: You watched it. Okay.\u00a0 Schaeffer: It\u2019s hard to watch too many. Colt: (Over funky music.) I never thought I would get married. All my previous relationships have ended with me getting a broken heart. (The funky music continues under Hunte\u2019s narration.) Hunte: Watching 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, I got this feeling that, for a lot of the cast, they might actually believe that a shot at the American dream is all they have to offer in exchange for love. Here\u2019s Colt, the guy who lives in Las Vegas. Colt: (Over the funky music again.) After having struck out a few times online with American girls, I thought maybe I could search outside the country, maybe find a girl. (The music fades out.) Hunte: But, as Americans put themselves on the international marriage market hoping to find someone more beautiful, more loyal, more grateful, if that love turns out not to be true, they also have the power to take that American dream away \u2026 Which brings me to one couple I think about a lot: Ashley and Jay. Ashley: (Over soft-rock acoustic guitar.) My name is Ashley. I\u2019m 31 years old, and I\u2019m from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Hunte: Ashley is in her 30s. She\u2019s white, blond, pretty, and a mother of two from Mechanicsburg, a town in Pennsylvania where more than 90 percent of the residents are white.\u00a0 While vacationing in Jamaica, she meets Jay, a Black, 20-year-old tattoo artist. Ashley: (Over lightly techno music.) I went to Jamaica with a group of friends and family to a big wedding. And, um, one night we decided to go out to a bar, and that\u2019s where I met Jay. Hunte: Ashley says she\u2019s been cheated on before, and Jay more or less admits that being faithful is hard for him. But when he proposes, she says yes. They file for the K-1 visa, and soon he\u2019s on a plane, traveling to live with her in America.\u00a0 But Ashley admits that she hasn\u2019t really thought about what that might mean for Jay, to live in a mostly white suburb. Ashley: (Over slightly tense music.) I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t have to deal with any racial issues, but I\u2019m also very naive to all of this. Hunte: Ashley and Jay get married, but shortly after the wedding, she finds out he had sex with another woman. So she calls him on the phone to confront him. Ashley: (The tense music continues, adding drama with each expletive.) If you show up at my house, the police will be waiting to deport your ass. I don\u2019t give a f***. I do not give a f***. He has to sit and rot in jail until they deport his ass. I don\u2019t give a f***. Hunte: And, just like that, Ashley goes from being this naive white woman who doesn\u2019t understand race in America to a white woman asking the police to remove her disappointing Black, immigrant husband from her life, and from her country. Ashley: I don\u2019t want him near me. I don\u2019t even want him in this country. He\u2019s here illegally. He needs to go back to Jamaica. (Low percussive music plays.) Hunte: Some of this ugliness\u2014this icky gender and racial dynamics, the heartbreak\u2014this is just classic reality-TV-show stuff. But this particular drama of the 90 days and the K-1 visa started way before reality TV. Hunte: For one thing, I, you know, I just kind of looked at the Wikipedia history of the K-1 visa, and I was kind of surprised to see that [Chuckles.] the Vietnam War had something to do with it. Schaeffer: Yeah. I mean, it actually has a lot longer history, I would say, than the Vietnam War. Hunte: After the break, how love got turned into a visa application. (A moment of synthesizer melody plays above the percussive music, followed by the break.) (A quick, goofy musical flourish.) Hunte: The journey to 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 is a long and winding one. As much as it\u2019s a story about love across borders, it\u2019s also a mini-drama about who we think is worthy of marriage and citizenship, and who has the power to decide. Felicity Amaya Schaeffer\u2014she\u2019s the professor at UC Santa Cruz who did research on so-called romance tours\u2014told us that one of the earliest immigration laws ever passed in the U.S. was about romance, or, at least, sex. Schaeffer: From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race.\u00a0 Hunte: The law was called the Page Act, passed in 1875. It restricted the migration of Asian laborers to the United States for, quote, \u201cimmoral purposes.\u201d And it was primarily enforced against Chinese immigrants\u2014but, more specifically, Chinese women. Schaeffer: If you were the wife of a wealthy Chinese merchant, you could come to the United States. But, if you were a lower-class woman, you could not come. And this has to do with trying to prevent laborers from migrating and bringing women that they thought would destroy the values of the United States.\u00a0 Hunte: U.S. lawmakers assumed that poor Chinese women coming to the United States were coming here to be sex workers. Schaeffer: This created some of the legislation that women had to have medical examinations before migrating. Hunte: Why were they having them do medical exams? Schaeffer: Chinese women were assumed to spread venereal diseases because they were assumed to be prostitutes. Women had to have that kind of medical exam before they were allowed entry. (Light, ringing synthesizer music seems to travel back in time.) Hunte: The law was eventually changed to allow more foreign women into the United States, but that\u2019s because American men demanded it. Starting with the Philippines War in the late 1800s, American men were going all over the world, fighting wars and colonizing\u2014and, in the meantime, meeting women they wanted to bring back to the U.S. and marry. After World War II, thousands of American men wanted to bring women back from Europe and Asia, but couldn\u2019t, because of immigration quotas. So Congress passed the War Brides Act. Schaeffer: This was a kind of pathway for men to bring back wives. And there was, like, 300,000 women that came. Hunte: It made it easier to bring the spouses of American military members back to the U.S. But the War Brides Act was only in effect for about three years\u20141945 to 1948. And as the Vietnam War began to wind down, American soldiers\u2014who, once again, wanted to bring more foreign wives back to the U.S.\u2014started demanding a more permanent solution. Schaeffer: So 1970 was when the K-1 process was actually finalized.\u00a0 Hunte: But the relatively clear, simple, and quick path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship offered by the K-1 visa has alarmed American politicians over the years, and led to panics about marriage fraud. Schaeffer: There were all kinds of media accounts about these sort of marriage-ring frauds that were allowing people to come in from Havana, and all these subversive types that were using marriage as a way to sort of skirt the usual immigration structures and enter into the country. And I think during the wars, it was a more clear understanding of how people met, and the conditions through which people met. Hunte: So the soldiers were going overseas, falling in love, bringing women back. Now, when in the absence of that, it\u2019s like, \u201cWait, why are these women coming here?\u201d Schaeffer: Mhm, mhm! [Hunte laughs.] Yeah! Yeah. \u201cWhat is their motivation for coming here?\u201d I think that\u2019s the next big phase, is already the presumption of fraud after the Vietnam War. Senator Alan Simpson: We\u2019re going to examine this issue of immigration marriage fraud.\u00a0 Hunte: Resulting in things like this: a Senate committee hearing on marriage fraud in 1985. Here\u2019s Senator Alan Simpson. Simpson: We\u2019re going to inquire into the nature and extent of this situation, determine whether we see but another way of gimmicking our generous\u2014very generous\u2014legal immigration laws. Hunte: And this led to a new immigration law. It made the green card immigrants got after they got married conditional. You didn\u2019t get a permanent green card until after you\u2019d been married for at least two years. Suspicion of immigrants continued well into the \u201990s, but the narrative changed to one where immigrants were now an economic liability. Schaeffer: Because, you know, that\u2019s always the language about immigrants, right? That they\u2019re a drain on the economy, that they\u2019re always taking from and, you know, using these precious resources that should go to citizens. Hunte: So the K-1 visa changed again. In 1996, President Clinton signed a new rule into law. Starting now, Americans who brought a spouse to the U.S. on the K-1 visa were now legally responsible for that person for 10 years. Schaeffer: Even if they divorce, he is taking up responsibility to make sure that she can live\u2014even without a job\u2014for the remainder of 10 years while in this country, if she decides to stay. Hunte: Wow. Yeah, that is\u2014that is a huge shift.\u00a0 Schaeffer: Yeah! Hunte: That\u2019s huge.\u00a0 Schaeffer: Yeah. Hunte: It sounds like it\u2019s to discourage people from doing this, is what it sounds like. Schaeffer: Yes. That is an entirely huge shift, and men came to me complaining about that [Laughs.] over and over again. Hunte: As part of her research, Felicity spent a lot of time on listservs for men interested in marrying foreign women. When this rule was put into place, she watched as they began to freak out, asking each other about potential red flags. Schaeffer: It was everything from, you know, \u201dShe doesn\u2019t want to have sex \u2019til we get married. Is this a red flag?\u201d \u201cIs she affectionate enough?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIs she, uh, hot and sexy in bed?\u201d Like, \u201cDoes she ask for money?\u201d That was a big one that would come up. And so, then, women, you know, didn\u2019t have the benefit of this kind of community, but would often talk to me, like, \u201cI feel, really, like I can\u2019t ask him for things that I need, because he seems so suspicious of me.\u201d\u00a0 Hunte: Mmm. Schaeffer: So, you know, it really did affect, um, what they could say to each other, how they would read each other\u2019s actions. Hunte: Felicity says the threat of financial consequences for a bad marriage with a foreign spouse may have made these kinds of relationships even more tense. Schaeffer: And so I think that part of that shift in the K-1 visa structure led to, actually\u2014or maybe facilitated\u2014more abusive relationships, because the men were so skeptical and sort of adopting the view of the state. (A heavy synthesizer whistle plays over a windswept musical landscape.) Hunte: In 2000, Anastasia King, a 19-year-old originally from Kyrgyzstan, was murdered by her American husband after she was brought to the U.S. on the K-1 visa. It\u2019s impossible to say for certain whether the pressure and suspicion that increased after changes to the K-1 visa increased the level of violence in these kinds of relationships. But, in response to this abuse, Congress realized it also had to protect immigrant spouses. So it passed the International Marriage Brokerage Regulation Act, or IMBRA, in 2005. Schaeffer: Where men have to provide criminal records, and women have to have their rights. Hunte: I spoke to a couple of immigration attorneys who told me immigrant women are still afraid that, if they report their American husbands for abuse, they\u2019ll be deported\u2014though there are provisions within IMBRA and the Violence Against Women Act to protect them. Even still, women in the U.S. on the K-1 visa, separated from family and community and unable to legally work, are often left vulnerable. (A beat.) Hunte: Today, as part of the K-1 application process, the foreign fianc\u00e9 has to sit for an interview with an American consular official who\u2019s trying to find out whether your relationship is real or a scam. You\u2019re asked about your American partner\u2019s birthday, education, family\u2014but you\u2019re also asked to maybe describe your engagement, or whether you\u2019re planning to go on a honeymoon, or what kind of wedding you\u2019re going to have. In other words, are you here for the right reasons? Do you really love this person? (Heavy music plays.) John, Colt\u2019s cousin: How do you express your love to Colt? Larissa: To show love? For me, it\u2019s clean the house. (The music continues under the narration.) Hunte: Those interviews with consular officials are never caught on camera. But you can kind of get an idea of how they might go, watching friends and family on 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 question the would-be foreign spouse. Here\u2019s Colt\u2019s cousin, John, asking Larissa to prove she loves Colt. (The heavy music continues.) John: You\u2019re not just coming over here to marry my man for a green card, are ya? Larissa: I\u2019m with him because I love him. (The music changes tone, like an investigative journalist intro on a late-night news show.) Larissa: (In a confessional interview.) Honestly, John was acting like he\u2019s policy or immigration officer. He was really rude to me. (The news-show music fades out.) Schaeffer: The United States is about choice and equality and democracy. So it\u2019s interesting to think about how romance sort of sits in for all of these other values of a democracy. Like, are you capable of consenting to this? Or, if you come from a poor background, are you forced into this because you have no other recourse? That you really choose this person because you love them, and not for any other reasons. So it\u2019s this sort of divorcing of economic questions from romantic ones. (Soft, pensive electric guitar plays over lo-fi electronica. The word Lovesick repeats periodically, like a whisper.) Hunte: So, Julia, what do you think? Longoria: I mean, [Laughs.] this is, like, what\u2019s so appealing and repulsing about reality TV, right? Watching this desperation on all sides play out like a car accident, you know? Are they here for the right reasons? Will they actually be truly in love? Hunte: You know, there are, like, some couples on the show where it\u2019s kind of obvious that the foreign fianc\u00e9 is, like, only here for that person, and it kind of plays out in these funny ways. Like, I\u2019m thinking about this one couple from the most recent season\u2014Jovi and Yara\u2014and Yara is from the Ukraine, and Jovi is an American guy from New Orleans. And they\u2019re having a fight on the street, and, at one point, Jovi says, \u201cOh, what? You\u2019re just going to go back to the Ukraine?\u201d and she just looks at him and says, \u201cYeah! I\u2019ll go back. I had a really nice life there!\u201d And you can see that she\u2019s, like, not here on a lark. She\u2019s not here because she thinks that the United States is better than the Ukraine. She actually, you know\u2014and she knows there\u2019s a stereotype about eastern European women, and she\u2019s rejecting that. She\u2019s just literally here to be with this guy. So I just also like this show because it\u2019s always questioning your assumptions about people and what their motivations might be. Longoria: Yeah! And it kind of raises the question, like, what are the \u201cright reasons\u201d to be in this kind of relationship\u2014 Hunte: Yeah! Longoria: \u2014or, really, any, right? (Chuckles.) Hunte: And why does the American government even care that much? [Both laugh.] You know, if people are scamming, let them scam each other and fall in love. That\u2019s all I have to say! (Laughs.) (Upbeat, bubblegum techno music plays up.) Hunte: I already think I know the answer to this question, but, Julia, do you think you will watch 90 Day Fianc\u00e9? (Bursts out laughing, and Longoria laughs too.) Longoria: I mean, you watched it so I don\u2019t have to! Hunte: Alright! Fair enough, fair enough. (Laughs lightly.) (The bubblegum music plays up.)

It\u2019s a little bit long\u2014it\u2019s like seven minutes or so\u2014\u2019cause this is your first time watching <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em>, anything having to do with <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em>, right?</p>\n<p>Julia Longoria: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p>Hunte: Okay, okay.</p>\n<p>Longoria: I\u2019m just curious, like, <em>why</em> are you interested in this? Like, why should someone care?</p>\n<p>Hunte: (<em>Insistently.</em>) Watch the clip, Julia! (<em>Laughs, and Longoria joins in.</em>)</p>\n<p>(<em>Music shifts into long, sustained notes to build drama.</em>)</p>\n<p>Longoria: We start today with correspondent Tracie Hunte guiding me into the unknown: the world of reality TV.</p>\n<p>(<em>A dramatic but upbeat musical flourish plays, like the intro to a theme song, before moving back to the plucky, quirky music.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Okay. So, Julia, <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </em>is a wildly popular show on TLC. It\u2019s about couples who are international\u2014like, it\u2019s usually one person lives in America, and the other person lives somewhere overseas\u2014and I want to begin your <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </em>journey with one couple in particular: Colt and Larissa.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Okay. I\u2019m gonna\u2014do I hit play?</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yes. Hit play!</p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>My name is Colt. I\u2019m 33 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: We are in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we\u2019re at the airport, and we\u2019re meeting Colt and Larissa. Colt is a white guy in his 30s. He lives in Las Vegas.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I am Larissa, 31 years old, from Minas Gerais, Brazil.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And Larissa is from Brazil. She is also in her 30s. And they met online. They went on vacation together\u2014to Cancun, I think\u2014and after five days of this vacation together, Colt asked Larissa to marry him. And so she said yes.</p>\n<p>Longoria: After one date they decided to get married?</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yes, effectively one date. So what we\u2019re doing right now is that we\u2019re meeting Larissa for the first time. She\u2019s just flown into Las Vegas, and this scene is basically her first impressions.</p>\n<p>Longoria: First impressions of Las Vegas, right?</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yes.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Here is hot.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>I don\u2019t have air-conditioning. [A chuckle.] It\u2019s going to get a little hotter too.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Oh my. I can feel the hot, warm.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: First of all, she\u2019s hot. [<em>Longoria chuckles.</em>] It\u2019s not the same sort of warmth in Brazil. I\u2019ve been to Brazil; I know the difference between desert heat and beach heat, [<em>Both laugh.</em>] and I know which one I vastly prefer.</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>My first goal in America is marry. Second, apply for the green card. And third, buy a car with air conditioner. [Laughs.]</em></p>\n<p>(<em>A beat.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I thought that was more big, you know.</em></p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>It\u2019s pretty big.</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Like New York.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Up-tempo, jazzy, big-city ambience plays.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Las Vegas is also this thing that\u2019s exported to the rest of the world through our movies and television shows\u2014<em>Ocean\u2019s 11</em>. Like, you get this idea that it\u2019s this glamorous, glitzy, big city, you know, \u201cAmerican dreams.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Longoria: Totally.</p>\n<p>Hunte: Blah, blah, blah.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Totally. Tall buildings, big lights.</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Like, casinos.</p>\n<p>Hunte: Exactly.</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>My first impressions of Las Vegas? Not a city I expected. I confused Las Vegas with Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York. It\u2019s not like the\u2014the movies.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And so you see her, like, get out of the car. She\u2019s still very hot. She\u2019s still very uncomfortable. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, here\u2019s the sign!\u201d And this is the world-famous Las Vegas sign. It\u2019s on postcards, it\u2019s on magnets, it\u2019s everywhere. And it was actually surprising to me, \u2019cause I also didn\u2019t realize it was that small. (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>Are you going back to Brazil? (Chuckles.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>No, no! I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s\u2014here\u2019s so warm.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>Yeah?</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>(Sighs.) Not in my American dream.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>This is America.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Melodramatic, heavy piano music plays for a moment.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: So yeah. I think that there\u2019s just a lot more going on here other than just, like, a disappointed woman coming from Brazil. I think it\u2019s, like, way bigger than that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(<em>A musical descent pulls us into a dreamlike tapestry of synthesizers and percussion.</em>)</p>\n<p>Longoria: Okay, back me up for a second. Why is the show called <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9?</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Well, it\u2019s called <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </em>because, if you\u2019re an American person who wants to marry somebody from another country and you want to bring them to the United States, you can bring them to the United States on something called a K-1 visa, or a fianc\u00e9 visa. And that gives that person permission to come to the United States to get married, but they have to do it within 90 days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so\u2014at least, how it functions in the world of the TV show; I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for a lot of couples\u2014you\u2019re going to spend those 90 days not only planning a wedding, but just, like, getting to know each other better, and figuring out whether or not you <em>could</em> actually live together, and whether or not this is what you want to go through with.</p>\n<p>Longoria: So what you\u2019re saying, like, <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9 </em>is a TV show based around this one piece\u2014or, really, like, this one clause\u2014in U.S. immigration policy?</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yes.</p>\n<p>Longoria: I\u2014I did not realize that. [Hunte laughs.] Like, I guess I\u2019ve always \u2026 The thing I don\u2019t like about reality shows is that, like, they\u2019re sort of contrived. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, 90 days to fall in love.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way the world works.\u201d But, in this case, it is. [<em>Both laugh.</em>] It literally is how the world works. Like, the U.S. government came up with this premise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yes! Yes. And, Julia, because you haven\u2019t been watching reality TV, you\u2019ve been missing a very important lesson about U.S. immigration policy. [<em>Both laugh.</em>] And I think this show is also, like, a really good textbook example of Americans\u2019 relationship with the world, and how the world sees Americans.</p>\n<p>(<em>Tonal shift: The music loops over the same few notes, hovering.</em>)</p>\n<p>Longoria: This week, correspondent Tracie Hunte, our resident reality-TV expert, watches one of the biggest shows on television and tells the story of how love got written into U.S. immigration law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u2019m Julia Longoria.

He actually gave himself the name \u201cBig Ed.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>It\u2019s funny because I\u2019m not tall. I am actually 4\u201911.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And then there\u2019s Rose, who is much younger. She\u2019s 23.</p>\n<p>(<em>Whimsical, reality-TV-show-style music plays, ostensibly to play up the comedy of the circumstances.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Rose Vega: </em><em>My name is Rose, and I am 23 years old. I\u2019m live in Caloocan City, Philippines.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: They met on Facebook, and they\u2019ve had their relationship just on Facebook, and, like, texting and calling. And he\u2019s traveling to the Philippines to meet her and her family\u2014and hopefully fall ever more deeply in love with her, and ask her to marry him.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Yeah, okay. (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>I spent the night at Rose\u2019s home.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And in this scene, Big Ed is waking up after spending the night in Rose\u2019s house.</p>\n<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>And this was one of the worst nights of my life. I\u2019m completely drained. I haven\u2019t slept. The mattress that I slept in was soaking wet. This was the first night I\u2019ve ever spent without access to air-conditioning. And I hated it. And I feel broken.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Music fades out.</em>)</p>\n<p>Longoria: (<em>As Hunte giggles.</em>) This is just so, so deeply uncomfortable to watch.</p>\n<p>Hunte: So, like, a lot of this show is cringe. I should just say.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Yeah. So walk me through what\u2019s happening here.</p>\n<p>Hunte: So, throughout the time that he\u2019s in the Philippines, there\u2019s, like, a scene where he\u2019s asking her to shave her legs, because he doesn\u2019t find her feminine enough for him. Or he makes a comment about her breath and gives her toothpaste and a toothbrush, but then it comes out that she actually has had an ulcer for many years, and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing her breath, and she\u2019s actually self-conscious about it, and she brushes her teeth all the time. But, on top of all that, Ed travels to the Philippines from San Diego\u2014something like six, seven thousand miles. And he goes because he\u2019s gonna rescue Rose from this situation, this poverty that she\u2019s in. And he\u2019s already been doing that. He\u2019s been, like, sending money to her and her family to help them out. But, from the second that he\u2019s in the Philippines, he\u2019s <em>so</em> completely helpless, and <em>she\u2019s</em> the one that ends up having to rescue <em>him</em> this entire trip.</p>\n<p>Why I find this so interesting is just, you know, to see this kind of power dynamic play out. And, also, like, it\u2019s just also really interesting to see the disconnect between how Americans see themselves and how the rest of the world sees Americans.</p>\n<p>(<em>Soft, lo-fi music plays.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: And so on this show, you see men like Big Ed. They say they lost hope that they could ever find a partner in the U.S., so they turned to international dating. And this is not just, like, some bizarre reality-TV show setup. Like, there\u2019s a whole industry built around this kind of relationship.</p>\n<p>(<em>Music out.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer: </em><em>Marriage is one of those ways in which women have\u2014for many, many generations and decades\u2014used marriage to get ahead.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Felicity Amaya Schaeffer is a professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race Studies at UC Santa Cruz. She\u2019s also the author of the book <em>Love and Empire. </em>Way before<em> 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, </em>Felicity became interested in how immigrants were using marriage to cross the border into the U.S. Over three years, she talked to dozens of men and women who were interested in these kinds of relationships.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>I ended up in Colombia and Mexico, interviewing women and men at these vacation romance tours about why they were interested in dating someone. Um \u2026</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Wait, what\u2019s a \u201cvacation romance tour\u201d? (Schaeffer chuckles lightly while Hunte laughs outright.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So, that is, um, these sort of big social parties that different companies host so that men from the United States and Canada can travel to Latin American countries and meet women in a big social event.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Lightly bouncy music plays.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: So here\u2019s what Felicity discovered. Say you\u2019re a woman in a foreign country interested in marrying an American man. You might contact one of these international dating sites, and they\u2019ll get some photos of you and include some of your stats.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Their weight, how tall they are\u2014all kinds of personal information\u2014and then their contact.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: The company then compiles these packages filled with these photos and contact info for all these women into these digital catalogs, and American men can look through them. And if they see someone they like, they could email them.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And then, usually, they\u2019ll all come together for these big sort of social parties. And it\u2019s a quick way to meet lots of women and for the women to be introduced to lots of men, all in one place.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Which is where Felicity would show up, asking questions.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Part of this that I\u2019m also interested in is the fantasies that foreign women usually have of life in the United States, and vice versa.</em></p>\n<p><em>You know, men sort of think that U.S. women are much too feminist and too modern and too independent. And they think that they\u2019re gonna find something very different in Russia, Latin America\u2014you know, wherever it is\u2014Asia. And so they often are surprised that women, um, are very strong, have strong personalities, they need certain things, and that they don\u2019t want to usually live in rural areas.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Did you peer into the dark heart of American masculinity?</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>What\u2019d you see when you looked\u2014when you peered it into it? (Laughs.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Oh my God, I mean, so many insecurities! Given the way in which desire is so entwined with status and money, you know, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a sad structure, that sort of capitalist context in which certain people become no one if you don\u2019t have some game.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>I have this amazing interview with a guy who said to me something that really clarified things. He said, \u201cYou know, in the United States, I\u2019m just the average Joe. But when I cross the border, I become Tom Cruise.\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>It was hard, in some ways, and I felt really creepy. And then it was also sad, you know, to see that there\u2019s so many lonely people that are just sort of in the shadows, um, that can\u2019t meet anyone and just, like, really want to connect.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Hmm.</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And these women are just desperate to come to the United States. And that the men, in some ways, broker their ticket to getting here.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Have you ever watched </em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9,<em> or heard about it?</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes. I have watched some of the episodes, of course! (Laughs.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>You watched it. Okay.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>It\u2019s hard to watch too many.</em></p>\n<p><em>Colt: </em><em>(Over funky music.) I never thought I would get married. All my previous relationships have ended with me getting a broken heart. (The funky music continues under Hunte\u2019s narration.)</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Watching <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em>, I got this feeling that, for a lot of the cast, they might actually believe that a shot at the American dream is all they have to offer in exchange for love. Here\u2019s Colt, the guy who lives in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p><em>Colt:</em><em> (Over the funky music again.) After having struck out a few times online with American girls, I thought maybe I could search outside the country, maybe find a girl. (The music fades out.)</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: But, as Americans put themselves on the international marriage market hoping to find someone more beautiful, more loyal, more grateful, if that love turns out not to be true, they also have the power to take that American dream away \u2026 Which brings me to one couple I think about a lot: Ashley and Jay.</p>\n<p><em>Ashley:</em><em> (Over soft-rock acoustic guitar.) My name is Ashley. I\u2019m 31 years old, and I\u2019m from Mechanicsburg,</em> <em>Pennsylvania.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Ashley is in her 30s. She\u2019s white, blond, pretty, and a mother of two from Mechanicsburg, a town in Pennsylvania where more than 90 percent of the residents are white.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While vacationing in Jamaica, she meets Jay, a Black, 20-year-old tattoo artist.</p>\n<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>(Over lightly techno music.) I went to Jamaica with a group of friends and family to a big wedding. And, um, one night we decided to go out to a bar, and that\u2019s where I met Jay.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Ashley says she\u2019s been cheated on before, and Jay more or less admits that being faithful is hard for him. But when he proposes, she says yes. They file for the K-1 visa, and soon he\u2019s on a plane, traveling to live with her in America.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Ashley admits that she hasn\u2019t really thought about what that might mean for Jay, to live in a mostly white suburb.</p>\n<p><em>Ashley:</em><em> (Over slightly tense music.) I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t have to deal with any racial issues, but I\u2019m also very naive to all of this.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Ashley and Jay get married, but shortly after the wedding, she finds out he had sex with another woman. So she calls him on the phone to confront him.</p>\n<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>(The tense music continues, adding drama with each expletive.)</em> <em>If you show up at my house, the police will be waiting to deport your ass. I don\u2019t give a f***. I do not give a f***. He has to sit and rot in jail until they deport his ass. I don\u2019t give a f***.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And, just like that, Ashley goes from being this naive white woman who doesn\u2019t understand race in America to a white woman asking the police to remove her disappointing Black, immigrant husband from her life, and from <em>her</em> country.</p>\n<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>I don\u2019t want him near me. I don\u2019t even want him in this country. He\u2019s here illegally. He needs to go back to Jamaica.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Low percussive music plays.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Some of this ugliness\u2014this icky gender and racial dynamics, the heartbreak\u2014this is just classic reality-TV-show stuff. But this particular drama of the 90 days and the K-1 visa started way before reality TV.</p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>For one thing, I, you know, I just kind of looked at the Wikipedia history of the K-1 visa, and I was kind of surprised to see that [Chuckles.] the Vietnam War had something to do with it.</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah. I mean, it actually has a lot longer history, I would say, than the Vietnam War.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: After the break, how love got turned into a visa application.</p>\n<p>(<em>A moment of synthesizer melody plays above the percussive music, followed by the break.</em>)</p>\n<p>(<em>A quick, goofy musical flourish.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: The journey to <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em> is a long and winding one. As much as it\u2019s a story about love across borders, it\u2019s also a mini-drama about who we think is worthy of marriage and citizenship, and who has the power to decide. Felicity Amaya Schaeffer\u2014she\u2019s the professor at UC Santa Cruz who did research on so-called romance tours\u2014told us that one of the earliest immigration laws ever passed in the U.S. was about romance, or, at least, sex.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: The law was called the Page Act, passed in 1875. It restricted the migration of Asian laborers to the United States for, quote, \u201cimmoral purposes.\u201d And it was primarily enforced against Chinese immigrants\u2014but, more specifically, Chinese women.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>If you were the wife of a wealthy Chinese merchant, you could come to the United States. But, if you were a lower-class woman, you could not come. And this has to do with trying to prevent laborers from migrating and bringing women that they thought would destroy the values of the United States.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: U.S. lawmakers assumed that poor Chinese women coming to the United States were coming here to be sex workers.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>This created some of the legislation that women had to have medical examinations before migrating.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Why were they having them do medical exams?</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Chinese women were assumed to spread venereal diseases because they were assumed to be prostitutes. Women had to have that kind of medical exam before they were allowed entry.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Light, ringing synthesizer music seems to travel back in time.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: The law was eventually changed to allow more foreign women into the United States, but that\u2019s because American men demanded it. Starting with the Philippines War in the late 1800s, American men were going all over the world, fighting wars and colonizing\u2014and, in the meantime, meeting women they wanted to bring back to the U.S. and marry.</p>\n<p>After World War II, thousands of American men wanted to bring women back from Europe and Asia, but couldn\u2019t, because of immigration quotas. So Congress passed the War Brides Act.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>This was a kind of pathway for men to bring back wives. And there was, like, 300,000 women that came.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: It made it easier to bring the spouses of American military members back to the U.S. But the War Brides Act was only in effect for about three years\u20141945 to 1948. And as the Vietnam War began to wind down, American soldiers\u2014who, once again, wanted to bring more foreign wives back to the U.S.\u2014started demanding a more permanent solution.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So 1970 was when the K-1 process was actually finalized.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: But the relatively clear, simple, and quick path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship offered by the K-1 visa has alarmed American politicians over the years, and led to panics about marriage fraud.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>There were all kinds of media accounts about these sort of marriage-ring frauds that were allowing people to come in from Havana, and all these subversive types that were using marriage as a way to sort of skirt the usual immigration structures and enter into the country. And I think during the wars, it was a more clear understanding of how people met, and the conditions through which people met.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>So the soldiers were going overseas, falling in love, bringing women back. Now, when in the absence of that, it\u2019s like, \u201cWait, why are these women coming here?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Mhm, mhm! [Hunte laughs.] Yeah! Yeah. \u201cWhat is their motivation for coming here?\u201d I think that\u2019s the next big phase, is already the presumption of fraud after the Vietnam War.</em></p>\n<p><em>Senator Alan Simpson: </em><em>We\u2019re going to examine this issue of immigration marriage fraud.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Resulting in things like this: a Senate committee hearing on marriage fraud in 1985. Here\u2019s Senator Alan Simpson.</p>\n<p><em>Simpson: </em><em>We\u2019re going to inquire into the nature and extent of this situation, determine whether we see but another way of gimmicking our generous\u2014very generous\u2014legal immigration laws.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: And this led to a new immigration law. It made the green card immigrants got after they got married conditional. You didn\u2019t get a permanent green card until after you\u2019d been married for at least two years.</p>\n<p>Suspicion of immigrants continued well into the \u201990s, but the narrative changed to one where immigrants were now an economic liability.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Because, you know, that\u2019s always the language about immigrants, right? That they\u2019re a drain on the economy, that they\u2019re always taking from and, you know, using these precious resources that should go to citizens.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: So the K-1 visa changed again. In 1996, President Clinton signed a new rule into law. Starting now, Americans who brought a spouse to the U.S. on the K-1 visa were now legally responsible for that person for 10 years.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Even if they divorce, he is taking up responsibility to make sure that she can live\u2014even without a job\u2014for the remainder of 10 years while in this country, if she decides to stay.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Wow. Yeah, that is\u2014that is a huge shift.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah!</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>That\u2019s huge.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>It sounds like it\u2019s to discourage people from doing this, is what it sounds like.</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes. That is an </em>entirely<em> huge shift, and men came to me complaining about that [Laughs.] over and over again.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: As part of her research, Felicity spent a lot of time on listservs for men interested in marrying foreign women. When this rule was put into place, she watched as they began to freak out, asking each other about potential red flags.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>It was everything from, you know, \u201dShe doesn\u2019t want to have sex \u2019til we get married. Is this a red flag?\u201d \u201cIs she affectionate enough?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIs she, uh, hot and sexy in bed?\u201d Like, \u201cDoes she ask for money?\u201d </em>That<em> was a big one that would come up.</em></p>\n<p><em>And so, then, women, you know, didn\u2019t have the benefit of this kind of community, but would often talk to me, like, \u201cI feel, really, like I can\u2019t ask him for things that I need, because he seems so suspicious of me.\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Mmm.</em></p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So, you know, it really did affect, um, what they could say to each other, how they would read each other\u2019s actions.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: Felicity says the threat of financial consequences for a bad marriage with a foreign spouse may have made these kinds of relationships even more tense.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And so I think that part of that shift in the K-1 visa structure led to, actually\u2014or maybe facilitated\u2014more abusive relationships, because the men were so skeptical and sort of adopting the view of the state.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>A heavy synthesizer whistle plays over a windswept musical landscape.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: In 2000, Anastasia King, a 19-year-old originally from Kyrgyzstan, was murdered by her American husband after she was brought to the U.S. on the K-1 visa. It\u2019s impossible to say for certain whether the pressure and suspicion that increased after changes to the K-1 visa increased the level of violence in these kinds of relationships. But, in response to this abuse, Congress realized it also had to protect immigrant spouses. So it passed the International Marriage Brokerage Regulation Act, or IMBRA, in 2005.</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Where men have to provide criminal records, and women have to have their rights.</em></p>\n<p>Hunte: I spoke to a couple of immigration attorneys who told me immigrant women are still afraid that, if they report their American husbands for abuse, they\u2019ll be deported\u2014though there are provisions within IMBRA and the Violence Against Women Act to protect them. Even still, women in the U.S. on the K-1 visa, separated from family and community and unable to legally work, are often left vulnerable.</p>\n<p>(<em>A beat.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Today, as part of the K-1 application process, the foreign fianc\u00e9 has to sit for an interview with an American consular official who\u2019s trying to find out whether your relationship is real or a scam. You\u2019re asked about your American partner\u2019s birthday, education, family\u2014but you\u2019re also asked to maybe describe your engagement, or whether you\u2019re planning to go on a honeymoon, or what kind of wedding you\u2019re going to have. In other words, are you here for the right reasons? Do you really love this person?</p>\n<p>(<em>Heavy music plays.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>John, Colt\u2019s cousin: </em><em>How do you express your love to Colt?</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>To show love? For me, it\u2019s clean the house.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>The music continues under the narration.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: Those interviews with consular officials are never caught on camera. But you can kind of get an idea of how they might go, watching friends and family on <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em> question the would-be foreign spouse. Here\u2019s Colt\u2019s cousin, John, asking Larissa to prove she loves Colt.</p>\n<p>(<em>The heavy music continues.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>John: </em><em>You\u2019re not just coming over here to marry my man for a green card, are ya?</em></p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I\u2019m with him because I love him.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>The music changes tone, like an investigative journalist intro on a late-night news show.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>(In a confessional interview.) Honestly, John was acting like he\u2019s policy or immigration officer. He was really rude to me.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>The news-show music fades out.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>The United States is about choice and equality and democracy. So it\u2019s interesting to think about how romance sort of sits in for all of these other values of a democracy. Like, are you capable of consenting to this? Or, if you come from a poor background, are you forced into this because you have no other recourse? That you really choose this person because you love them, and not for any other reasons. So it\u2019s this sort of divorcing of economic questions from romantic ones.</em></p>\n<p>(<em>Soft, pensive electric guitar plays over lo-fi electronica. The word </em>Lovesick<em> repeats periodically, like a whisper.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: So, Julia, what do you think?</p>\n<p>Longoria: I mean, [<em>Laughs</em>.] this is, like, what\u2019s so appealing and repulsing about reality TV, right? Watching this desperation on all sides play out like a car accident, you know? Are they here for the right reasons? Will they actually be truly in love?</p>\n<p>Hunte: You know, there are, like, some couples on the show where it\u2019s kind of obvious that the foreign fianc\u00e9 is, like, only here for that person, and it kind of plays out in these funny ways. Like, I\u2019m thinking about this one couple from the most recent season\u2014Jovi and Yara\u2014and Yara is from the Ukraine, and Jovi is an American guy from New Orleans. And they\u2019re having a fight on the street, and, at one point, Jovi says, \u201cOh, what? You\u2019re just going to go back to the Ukraine?\u201d and she just looks at him and says, \u201cYeah! I\u2019ll go back. I had a really nice life there!\u201d And you can see that she\u2019s, like, not here on a lark. She\u2019s not here because she thinks that the United States is better than the Ukraine. She actually, you know\u2014and she knows there\u2019s a stereotype about eastern European women, and she\u2019s rejecting that. She\u2019s just literally here to be with this guy. So I just also like this show because it\u2019s always questioning your assumptions about people and what their motivations might be.</p>\n<p>Longoria: Yeah! And it kind of raises the question, like, what are the \u201cright reasons\u201d to be in this kind of relationship\u2014</p>\n<p>Hunte: Yeah!</p>\n<p>Longoria: \u2014or, really, any, right? (<em>Chuckles.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: And why does the American government even care that much? [<em>Both laugh.</em>] You know, if people are scamming, let them scam each other and fall in love. That\u2019s all I have to say! (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>\n<p>(<em>Upbeat, bubblegum techno music plays up.</em>)</p>\n<p>Hunte: I already think I know the answer to this question, but, Julia, do you think you will watch <em>90 Day Fianc\u00e9</em>? (<em>Bursts out laughing, and Longoria laughs too.</em>)</p>\n<p>Longoria: I mean, you watched it so I don\u2019t have to!</p>\n<p>Hunte: Alright! Fair enough, fair enough.
