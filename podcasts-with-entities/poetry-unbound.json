He imagines his fingers opening and closing things, like buttons, the eyes of a dead person, relationships. In doing so, the poem asks us to simply pay attention, today, to what we\u2019re doing with our hands \u2014 to understand them as intimate pathways into the stories of our bodies and the stories of our lives.</p><p>A question to reflect on after you listen: What have you done with your hands today? What are you opening? What are you closing?</p><p>About the Poet:</p><p>Ross Gay is a writer and a professor of English at Indiana University Bloomington.
