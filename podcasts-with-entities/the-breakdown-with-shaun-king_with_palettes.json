Back then there was no vaccine for the Coronavirus, we were all stuck in quarantine, and George Floyd would be murdered later that day. To commemorate our one year anniversary Sick Empire will highlight the crimes against humanity happening in East Jerusalem. You\u2019ll hear Branden Janese in conversation with four guests who all share a link to social justice work in the Middle East. In true Sick Empire fashion we blend together voices that would have most likely never found themselves in a room together including, a New York City public defender, a Muslim community organizer, a Black girl who currently lives on the Gaza Strip, and a historian and writer.</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>This episode is a rollercoaster.

Now listen, I didn't expect him to have the heart required to stay home and serve and help his state as they suffer through a once-in-a-lifetime snowstorm. The man has proven over and over again that he doesn't have the heart to help people who are hurting, but you'd at least think he'd have the political sense to know that taking a damn vacation to Cancun while people in your state literally freeze to death is bad optics. <br>\n<br>\nBut here's the thing - the bottom line - conservative voters have taught their leaders that nothing matters. Of course, Ted Cruz thinks he can go on vacation to Cancun while people freeze to death - because conservative voters have already announced, with their support of both him and Trump, that character and integrity and values no longer matter to them. <br>\nLet me unpack and explain it.<br>\n<br>\nIf you listen to The Breakdown and want to help support the work we do, consider becoming a member of our Patreon at <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thebreakdown\">www.patreon.com/thebreakdown</a> for exclusive members perks and early access to content.</div>\n",

All of those will remain.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, the majority of private prisons on the federal level are immigration detention centers. Joe Biden decided not to end those either. He's keeping those.<br>\n<br>\nLastly, we learned that he's not even ending the few private federal prisons that do exist. The executive order just said they won't renew their contracts. Many of them have contracts that last for years on end.<br>\n<br>\nSo, nobody is being freed. No city, county, or state private prisons are ending. No private ICE detention centers are ending. And they aren't closing down the others any time soon either.<br>\n<br>\nIn the end, that executive order will hardly impact anyone.

This system can clearly charge who it wants, when it wants.\nIf you listen to The Breakdown and want to help support the work we do, consider becoming a member of our Patreon at\u00a0www.patreon.com/thebreakdown\u00a0for exclusive members perks and early access to content."
