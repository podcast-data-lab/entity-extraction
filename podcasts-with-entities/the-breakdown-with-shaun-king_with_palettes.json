The problem is two-fold, though. It's going to dominate the news for weeks and months to come, even when it shouldn't, because it's clearly good for their ratings. And when Trump becomes the primary focus of the news, VERY VERY important stories end up not being told.\nLike what's happening in the Tennessee legislature as we speak. It's one of the closest things to fascism we've ever seen. At least 3 duly elected Democratic State Representatives are about to literally be removed from their positions because they participated in a peaceful protest about gun control. First their key cards were disabled and now legislation has been drafted to remove them from the legislature...permanently.\nIt's a scary thing - and makes me very concerned about the path we might be going down right now.\nLet me unpack and explain it.\nTo listen to today\u2019s FULL EPISODE of The Breakdown go now to Apple Podcasts or Spotify and search for \u201cThe Breakdown with Shaun King.\u201d Subscribe there for FREE and listen to the whole podcast.\nIf you are already on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, please subscribe, listen, share, leave reviews, and listen daily to the entire episode.

                "summary": "Am I surprised? No. But am I disgusted down to my bones? Absolutely. After begging and pleading for Black votes... After wearing Kente cloth and taking a knee for injustice in America... After marching and protesting against injustice - the Democratic Party just spit in the face of Black leaders, Black voters, and Black people in general.\nLet me explain. The Washington DC City Council voted 12-1, in a near unanimous vote, to pass important criminal justice reforms for the city. And I say this with all due respect to the City Council, but the reforms are moderate. They aren't revolutionary or radical. They are basic.DC is a majority Black city. The City Council is a majority-Black body. And suddenly after they passed these reforms, rich white people in the city flipped out. Then conservatives flipped out. And that's an important observation to make, because it was seeing this that caused the conservative media to flip out. Which in turn caused Republicans in Congress to say they were going to do something that has not been done since 1991. They were going to use their power in Congress to overturn the Washington DC City Council. Since DC is not a state, Congress has this weird power, but it's RARELY used.\nThe thing is, they would need Biden and some more Democrats to side with them - and after pressure, they've agreed to do just that.\nAnd here's the rub. To get this support, conservatives AND Biden have flat out lied about these reforms - particularly around the issue of carjacking.\nThe reforms took the sentencing for carjacking down from 40 years, which is the highest and harshest in the nation, down to 24 years, which is still the highest and harshest in the nation. And Biden has been parroting Republican talking points saying this is going to make the city less safe.\nBut here's the thing - DC has the harshest sentencing on carjacking in America right now, and it's STILL a problem. Why? Because 40 years for carjacking doesn't solve the problem.

My whole family loves him.\nBut sadly, over the past year, he has had at least 3 incidents with guns, that have made it clear, to say the least, that Ja is not quite on the right path.\nTruthfully, a full fledged intervention needed to happen after the first incident.

                "summary": "As you no doubt saw - conservative Brazilian supporters of their recently ousted President, Jair Bolsonaro, inspired by the January 6th insurrection 2 years ago in the United States, just attempted to take over the Congress, Supreme Court, and Presidential Palace in the Capitol of Brazil.\n\nAlmost 2 years to the day, under almost identical circumstances, these conservatives attempted and failed the same foolishness that we saw right here in the US. And here's the thing - it looked so similar, because they were literally coached by American conservatives. And several things need to happen immediately.\n\nJair Bolsonaro, who is an open bigot, should be deported/extradited BACK to Brazil. The man is literally hiding out in Florida - which is simultaneously wild and makes perfect sense at the same time. Of course he would travel to the home state of Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis to hide. But the United States has an extradition treaty with Brazil and should send him right back home to face the consequences for what he caused.\n\nSecondly, an immediate investigation needs to be launched into the American conservatives that coached Brazilian conservatives through all of this. They openly admit, publicly and privately, that they've been telling Brazilians exactly what to do to undermine faith in their elections and in their democracy. And Brazil should charge them - so that they can also face the consequences for what they just caused.\n\nLet me unpack and explain it all.\n\nTo listen to today\u2019s FULL EPISODE of The Breakdown go now to Apple Podcasts or Spotify and search for \u201cThe Breakdown with Shaun King.\u201d Subscribe there for FREE and listen to the whole podcast.\n\nIf you are already on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, please subscribe, listen, share, leave reviews, and listen daily to the entire episode.

                "summary": "Over the past few days I've sat back and observed a WIDE range of opinions being expressed about Deion Sanders leaving his HBCU coaching job at Jackson State for a new position at a struggling predominantly white institution. And I've seen EVERYTHING you could imagine be expressed from what seemed like genuine anger and rage to excitement and encouragement for him - and everything in between.Today I want to unpack and explain my own thoughts on the matter. First and foremost, I'm just glad that he ever chose to spend the past 3 years at an HBCU. And he clearly poured his heart and soul into the program. He was brilliant. Do I wish he would've stayed longer? Sure. But I don't know his long term goals and dreams. Clearly he has other aspirations.\n\nBut more than anything, as a super fan of sports, I think what Deion Sanders just did is EXACTLY what every single college coach in sports does. They all promise parents and students and programs that they will be there forever - and eventually they leave for something else. In fact, it happened about a dozen times this past week alone.\n\nI just guess all of hoped Coach Prime would be different. Let me unpack and explain it.\n\nTo listen to today\u2019s FULL EPISODE of The Breakdown go now to Apple Podcasts or Spotify and search for \u201cThe Breakdown with Shaun King.\u201d Subscribe there for FREE and listen to the whole podcast.\n\nIf you are already on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, please subscribe, listen, share, leave reviews, and listen daily to the entire episode.

All 3 of them must resign immediately or be removed. Another person involved, a local labor leader, has already done the right thing and stepped down.\n\nWe have a lot to talk about here - because what their disgusting racism reveals, is that we have very narrow definitions of WHO is racist in this country.\n\nWhen most people think of racism they think of racist white people. Who are likely conservatives. And maybe in the Deep South. But that is a very narrow way to see racism in this country. Let's be clear - a lot of racism comes from those groups, but that's not all of it.\n\nThese 3 city council members are prominent members of the Democratic Party.

I have known Chaka for years and he is literally one of the most peaceful, respectful, kind, and outgoing men I've ever met.\n\nWhen I learned the news of what happened to Chaka, like thousands of others, I was devastated. When I saw the footage of what happened to Chaka, and to a female colleague of his that was also brutally attack by the men, it broke my heart. It's a miracle he even survived.\n\nIt was my expectation that the men who assaulted them were going to be charged. They should still be charged, frankly. And ANYONE who sees what happened, will think the same thing.\n\nThat's why it makes NO SENSE that somehow the Atlanta Police charged Chaka with murder when the ONLY thing he was doing was literally defending himself from being killed. It's outrageous.\n\nChaka fired his gun in self-defense and self-defense alone. And he might have died had he not done so. It is a textbook case of someone standing their ground - not just during a threat, but during a literal life or death assault.\n\nImmediately, these bogus charges against Chaka need to be dropped.

                "summary": "Yesterday I told you how a conservative white woman named Katie Bernhardt has become the chair of the Democratic Party of Louisiana - and blocked the endorsement of Gary Chambers.\n\nNow, it turns out that the Black man that she hand-picked as her Vice Chair is so conservative that the most conservative Republicans in Texas are throwing fundraisers FOR HIM. And not as a practical joke. This man, C. Travis Johnson, is also another wolf in sheep's clothing. He's SO BAD that he recently side with Republicans and voted FOR their racist gerrymandering and redistricting plan. Black folk in the legislature could not believe it.\n\nBut it's not just that. The man is skipping important votes for Black voters and voting against the priorities of Black people REGULARLY. In other words, both the chair and vice chair of the Democratic Party in Louisiana, a party dominated by Black voters, are actively working against the interests of Black voters. They both need to be removed immediately.\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"

Amy strangely made her campaign about ME, of all people, running ads blasting me, and my support of her opponent, but voters knew better and saw right through it, thankfully.\n\nHere's the thing - when a progressive loses somewhere, it's all over the news. We need them to now keep that same energy for Memphis.\n\nShout out to the new DA, Steve Mulroy, who ran a great campaign. And shout out to the voters and volunteers in Memphis who made it happen. Proud of you!\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

                "summary": "Did you see the video where the pastor in Brooklyn got robbed at gunpoint during a church service? I don't wish that on anyone. However, the truth is that it's foolish to wear a million dollars worth of jewelry ANYWHERE in public. And it's doubly disrespectful for a pastor in a poor and working class neighborhood to do such a thing.\n\nListen, again, I am not condoning armed robbery, but let me frame it another way. Would it be unethical for a man to walk down the middle of street in the hood with stacks of $1 million in cash? I say yes. It's inviting danger and it's tempting people who are struggling from day to day as it is. If you walked through the hood with a million dollars in cash in your hands, I would stop just short of saying you deserve to get robbed, but you damn near do.\n\nWearing $1 million in jewelry is the exact same thing. It's flossing. In the worst way.\n\nLet me unpack and explain it. Listen to today's full episode here, and hundreds more, on Apple Podcast, Spotify, or at TheNorthStar.com.\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"

They need it. But along the way, the fathers have been forgotten and they need our help.\n\nWe are working directly with the families of Mike Brown and Oscar Grant to support a retreat for these great men, but we need YOU to chip in today to help cover the costs. Please click the link in my bio on IG and click on the picture of the fundraiser to support them now. 100% of the proceeds go straight to the retreat.\n\nAs you may know, we are going through some cool changes and testing out some new options for the future of The Breakdown podcast and we need all of our listeners to PLEASE complete this quick survey.\n\nThe link will be in my bio on Instagram until Sunday night or you can go directly to: https://forms.gle/SeABuvGARcx9oSbP6And yes, if you already completed the earlier survey, we still need you to complete this one.\n\nTHANK YOU!!!\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

It has caused my wife, my kids, my mother, my extended family, and the organizations I lead so much trouble and heartache. This week his co-founders came out to say that he has not only mistreated them and stolen their work, but that he has failed to account for an astounding $40 million he raised in the names of families that he hasn't even supported. Now it all makes sense to me. He has laser-focused misinformation campaigns on me to get the attention off of himself.\n\nYou don't have to believe in Karma for it to be real. The principle of \"you reap what you sow\" is thousands of years old. And I don't delight in the Karma Deray is now receiving - that's not my way - but I will say it's overdue.\n\nSadly, after years of people lying and saying I was the one misspending funds - in spite of me releasing hundreds of pages of reports and accounting showing nothing of the sort, we now see that it is actually a real problem with Deray and many others in this movement. All I can do is continue to let my work and my impact speak for itself.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"

And NOTHING got better.\n\nIf we are going to be serious about public safety, pouring all of our money into policing, which already takes $789 million PER DAY in America, simply won't work.\n\nListen, if you love this podcast, we need your support.

The image I included with today's podcast on Instagram is of Rouzan al-Najjar - a brilliant (and of course unarmed and non violent) nurse that was killed by an Israeli sniper.\n\nLet me be clear - only dictators and guilty monsters oppose human rights investigations. The International Criminal Court is one of the most respected bodies in the world and the Biden administration just announced not that they oppose charges of war crimes, but that they even oppose an investigation into human rights violations. It's a despicable thing. Today, on @TheBreakdown - I unpack and explain it all.\n\nThis podcast is produced by The North Star, a Black-owned and operated independent media platform for liberation-journalism.

It is possibly the most impactful work of my life. We are the single most important organization in the nation that focuses exclusively on electing District Attorneys across the country. After we elect DA's, we partner with them to help them keep their campaign promises. We support them as they are attacked from every side.

                "summary": "In some ways, it seems like it was 5 years ago, and not 1, that Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gigi, and 7 of their friends suddenly died in a helicopter crash. In the shadows of that enormous loss, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and countless others were killed in acts of racial violence. And the pandemic then overtook our entire nation - killing over 400,000 people in the process. In some ways, I think the way we've grieved the loss of Kobe and Gigi over the past year, has served as a way for us to grieve the hundreds of thousands of lives we've lost in this past year. Listen - and let me unpack and explain what I mean.\n\nIf you listen to The Breakdown and want to help support the work we do, consider becoming a member of our Patreon at www.patreon.com/thebreakdown for exclusive members perks and early access to content.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

The War on Poverty is constructed out of tens of thousands of laws and ordinances. On today's episode, we examine the policies that criminalize homelessness. There are certain cities and states that are making an effort to roll-back those policies, but many politicians, businesses, and police unions are opposing these reforms. To break down exactly what that looks like, Shaun focuses in on a specific ordinance in Austin, TX and lays out what we can do to support one mayor's efforts to decriminalize homelessness.\n\n\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
