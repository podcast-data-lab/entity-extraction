    "description": "<p>\u200b\u200bIn 1987, 18-year-old Michelle Schofield was found dead in a phosphate pit in Florida. Two years later, her husband Leo was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Fifteen years later, previously unidentified fingerprints matched Jeremy Scott--a violent teenager who lived nearby. Jeremy has since confessed to Michelle\u2019s murder. Yet Leo Schofield remains behind bars.</p>\r\n<p>In this groundbreaking podcast, Bone Valley host Gilbert King uncovers startling new evidence that Jeremy is responsible for a string of murders. King is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Devil in the Grove, which led to the exonerations of four innocent men.</p>\r\n<p><em>Bone Valley </em>is a production of Lava for Good Podcasts in association with Signal Co. No1.</p>",

Fifteen years later, previously unidentified fingerprints matched Jeremy Scott--a violent teenager who lived nearby. Jeremy has since confessed to Michelle\u2019s murder. Yet Leo Schofield remains behind bars.\r\n\r\nIn this groundbreaking podcast, Bone Valley host Gilbert King uncovers startling new evidence that Jeremy is responsible for a string of murders. King is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Devil in the Grove, which led to the exonerations of four innocent men.\r\n\r\nBone Valley is a production of Lava for Good Podcasts in association with Signal Co. No1."
