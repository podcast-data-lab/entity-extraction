            "content": "<p>Tony Hale (<i>Veep, Arrested Development, Toy Story 4, Being the Ricardos, Clifford The Big Red Dog, Archibald\u2019s Next Big Thing</i>) discusses the impact a chronic, invisible condition can have on mental health. He explains how living with severe asthma shifted his worldview and contributed to his anxiety and panic attacks, and the consequences of living life in a state of constant vigilance. Tony opens up about how being bullied led him to build a comedic defense system, why he loves connecting with others who share his condition, and the importance of seeing yourself in other people. Mayim and Tony bond over the role faith plays in their mental wellness, learning to practice contentment, and the similarities between cognitive behavioral therapy and meditation.

He details the best lifestyle changes and emerging technologies available now to prevent most diseases until our 80\u2019s, increase longevity, and even reverse the effects of aging. David opens up about his mental health struggles stemming from his own insecurities and frustrations with the planet, how his mother\u2019s passing changed his outlook on life, and the dream he had that influenced his research and became a turning point in his career. After debating about intermittent fasting, Mayim and David examine the thread between solving problems in medicine, economics, and sociology, the effects of stress on the aging process, and mental health components tied to the aging brain. Mayim considers the amount of resources needed if humans lived longer, and the impact western culture\u2019s attitude about aging might have on an increased lifespan."
