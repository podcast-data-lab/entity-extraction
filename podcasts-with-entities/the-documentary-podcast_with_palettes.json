In Gaza, roughly half the population is under 18, and although communications are very difficult, young people have been sending us voice messages when they have enough internet. Sanabel (16) is sheltering with her family. In her messages, she said: \u201cNo one cares about us. They think we are terrorists. We are truly suffering.\u201d In Israel, thousands have been preparing militarily for the country\u2019s aim of eliminating Hamas. For the majority, turning 18 means joining the army.

As Elizabeth Gabriel reports for Assignment, how we remember the past remains a divisive issue.\n\nProduced by Ben Wyatt\nProduction Coordinator: Gemma Ashman\nStudio mix: Rod Farquhar\nAssignment editor: Penny Murphy\n\n(Image: Statue of Henrietta Lacks on Lacks Plaza, Roanoke.

She speaks with victims and eyewitnesses who reveal a shocking culture of sexual abuse and despair, with claims that many people knew, and many stayed silent. We follow a coach who, at personal risk, is determined to bring about change. Football\u2019s world governing body, FIFA, is facing accusations of failing to take effective action over the scandal. \n\nPresented by Khadidiatou Ciss\u00e9\nProduced by Stephanie Stafford and Suzanne Vanhooymissen. \nBBC Eye editors Rebecca Henschke and Tom Watson\nMixed by Neil Churchill\nAssignment series editor: Penny Murphy\n\n(Image: Child holding football boots.

                "summary": "Gnawa music is a Moroccan spiritual musical tradition developed by descendants of enslaved people from Sub-Saharan Africa. It combines ritual poetry with traditional music and dance, and is traditionally only performed by men. But one female Moroccan artist, Asm\u00e2a Hamzaoui, has broken the mould. She's become an international star, who has even performed for Madonna on her birthday. For Assignment, reporter Myriam Francois travels to Casablanca to meet Asmaa and her family, and follows her to the Essaouira Festival, the annual celebration of Gnawa culture.\n\nWhat does its ever-growing popularity tell us about the changing identity of a country that once saw itself primarily as part of the Arab world, but has now become more interested in its links to the rest of the African continent?\n\nPresented by Myriam Francois\nProduced by Tim Whewell\nSeries editor Penny Murphy\n\n(Image: Asm\u00e2a Hamzaoui.

                "summary": "Baptist minister Dr Martin Luther King Jr delivered his \"I have a dream\" speech on 28 August 1963 to crowds of over 250,000 in Washington DC as part of the Great March, which called for jobs and freedom for African Americans. It helped spur the passage of the US Civil Rights Act of 1964. On the 60th anniversary of this legendary speech, Emmy award-winning journalist Sherri Jackson meets speakers from differing religious backgrounds and experiences to talk about how they have been influenced by Dr King's words. They discuss the details of his vision, and the role of faith in securing social justice and in anti-racism protest today. \n\nProduced by Nina Robinson\nSeries producer: Rajeev Gupta\nProduction coordinator: Mica Nepomuceno"

                "summary": "Tens of thousands of Russian criminals \u2013 murders, rapists, robbers \u2013 were recruited from prisons by the mercenary group, Wagner, to fight in Ukraine. Now, after six months on the battlefield, the survivors have returned home, with official pardons. Many served only a fraction of their original sentences. And now, they're officially treated as heroes - protected by a new law which criminalises discreditation of anyone who fights on the Russian side in the war.\n\nAlready, some returnees are reported to have committed further serious crimes. One has confessed to the brutal axe-murder of his 85-year-old former landlady. In another case, an ex-convict believed to have served with Wagner has been charged with masterminding the killing of two children's entertainers, one of them a 19-year-old woman who was training to be a teacher. The murders in southern Russia provoked an outpouring of anger and grief, with thousands signing a petition demanding that the alleged ringleader - who denies any guilt - should get a life sentence if he is eventually convicted. But they know any punishment will probably be less severe, because the criminal records of former Wagner mercenaries have been wiped. They start their lives again from a clean slate, and if they re-offend, no previous convictions can be considered.\n\nReporter Arseny Sokolov talks to the mother of the murdered entertainer, to campaigners for prison reform - and to an ex-convict who fought for Wagner - to investigate what threat the returned mercenaries pose in their home towns and villages - and to assess the damage \"legal nihilism\" is doing to Russian society.\n\nProducer: Tim Whewell\nEditor: Penny Murphy\n\n(Image: A poster showing Wagner Group servicemen with a slogan reading \u201cJoin the winning team\u201d in St. Petersburg, Russia, 24 June 2023.

                "summary": "The crime writer Agatha Christie remains the best-selling novelist of all time even though her death was almost 50 years ago. Her fictional detective Hercule Poirot has attained legendary status, so for a modern novelist to breathe new life into the character is a considerable challenge. However, the English psychological crime author Sophie Hannah has been doing just that. In 2014 she wrote her first novel using Poirot as the central character and we follow her in 2018 as she prepares her third Poirot novel for publication, entitled The Mystery of Three Quarters. Felicity Finch next catches up with Sophie as her fifth Poirot novel, Hercule Poirot\u2019s Silent Night, is due to be published."

                "summary": "Many Western fashion brands source garments from Bangladesh, a country with a long history of producing affordable clothing. The industry suffered a devastating disaster in 2013 when the eight-storey Rana Plaza factory building near Dhaka collapsed, costing the lives of more than 1100 workers. Ten years on, Bangladesh has tried to reinvent its image: it has brought in safer working conditions and is positioning itself as a sustainable green textile producer. \n\nDespite the extra costs of becoming more environmentally friendly, the clothes Bangladesh exports remain surprisingly affordable. In this documentary, fashion media producer and rights campaigner Sheemtana Shameem asks how this is possible. \n\nShe looks into technologies to help sustainable production, examines what sustainability costs, and visits textile manufacturers to find out what it takes to ensure that sustainability itself remains sustainable. Ultimately, she asks, who is paying the price of Bangladesh\u2019s textile industry going green? Will we all have to dig deeper into our pockets if we want to continue wearing clothes made in Bangladesh?\n\nProducer: Shiroma Silva\nA CTVC production for the BBC World Service"

Now Russian tourist visas have been banned by the Finnish Government and the local mayor says the region is losing a million euros every day. \n \nThe country\u2019s army has male conscription, defence spending is at NATO levels and Finland\u2019s cities have underground shelters to protect its population.\n\nCaroline Bayley looks at Finland\u2019s relationship with Russia \u2013 past and present \u2013 and asks what\u2019s next for these uneasy neighbours.\n \nProducer/presenter Caroline Bayley\nEditor Penny Murphy\nStudio Engineer Rod Farquhar\nProduction co-ordinator Helena Warwick-Cross\n\n(Photo: Almost deserted border post on Finland\u2019s border with Russia.

At one end, the southern African nation of Namibia where leading politicians and businessmen are facing trial on racketeering charges, accused of running an elaborate scheme that squandered valuable fish stocks, meant to help people out of poverty. On the other a powerful fishing company under scrutiny in Iceland, a country long credited with the image of transparency and honest dealing."

                "summary": "In Sweden\u2019s far north, indigenous Sami people say their traditional culture and way of life is being threatened by the country\u2019s drive to develop carbon-cutting industries. In the Arctic town of Jokkmokk, a controversial new iron-ore mine has been given conditional approval in a reindeer herding area. Supporters of the project argue it is needed to extract materials to build a new green infrastructure in Sweden, and to create new jobs. But the mine is opposed by many Sami, including artist and music producer Maxida M\u00e4rak. The BBC's Maddy Savage hears both sides of the debate."

But others describe their anxiety as they wave goodbye to their menfolk, their confused feelings about the war - a mixture of patriotism and doubt - and the chaotic organisation of the call up. Some recruits have had to buy their own uniform and equipment. Others have suffered as discipline breaks down at some training camps. Tim talks to a former policewoman determined to encourage support for the war, who makes stretchers for wounded Russian soldiers - and to a young woman who believes it was her boyfriend's duty to be a soldier. But Yelena Koltun - who lost her son Sasha - cannot understand what her country is fighting for. \n\nPresented and produced by Tim Whewell"

Not only is the Farc increasing its kidnapping activity, targeting police and military hostages, but many of the soldiers already in captivity - some kept in barbed-wire cages and held isolation in for over a decade - are losing hope of ever being rescued.  Colonel Espejo knew that in order for future missions to succeed, he\u2019d need to warn the captives that help was coming so they could be ready to make a break for it when the army arrived. But how do you get a message across to military hostages without tipping off their captors and placing them in even greater danger? The unexpected solution - hide the message in a pop song with an interlude in morse code that the military hostages could decipher."

There is one entry in the registers that simply says 'Recaptive Number 11,407, without name, deaf and dumb'. In this documentary mixing poetry and new historical research, award-winning deaf poet Raymond Antrobus goes on a personal journey to Sierra Leone to trace a piece of forgotten history and try to find out what became of this deaf man without a name."

                "summary": "Just over a decade ago, President Xi Jinping was a virtual unknown. Few would say that now. In ten years, he\u2019s reworked the Chinese Communist party, the military and the government so that he\u2019s firmly in control. He\u2019s also vanquished all of his obvious rivals. And now, he\u2019s about to extend his time in office. Some say Xi might stay in the top job indefinitely. So how did Xi Jinping do it? Celia Hatton, the BBC\u2019s Asia Pacific editor, speaks to fellow China watchers to find out."
