Brian Kim is the founder and president of the Antioch Center for Training and Sending, a missions organization committed to equipping young leaders to pioneer the expansion of the gospel amongst unreached and unengaged people groups. For nearly a decade, he served on the senior leadership team of the International House of Prayer in Kansas City (IHOPKC). Brian resides in Colorado Springs with his wife and children and serves alongside Every Home for Christ, an international missions organization systematically reaching millions with the gospel each year in over 130 nations.

God puts you in situations you are flat out not strong enough, so that in that place you can experience His strength. We believe embracing your weakness is a key discipline for leaders and we dive into what it looks like this month.
