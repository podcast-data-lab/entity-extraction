A mollusk lives in that shell, and it\u2019s a staple food in the Bahamas\u2014so much so that overfishing is threatening their existence, but a few simple solutions may solve the problem.\nThe oldest musical instrument was once thought to be a cave bear bone flute made by Neanderthals, but recent evidence suggests that the holes were made by animals rather than tools.\nMore information about each instrument:\nThe organization First Sounds found and brought to life the recordings of \u00c9douard-L\u00e9on Scott de Martinville. Head to their website to learn more about that project.\nBettina Joy de Guzman travels the world, composing and performing music on ancient instruments. You can read more about her work on her website.\nMore information about the bells of Bronze Age China can be found at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art. Check out a virtual version of their collection.\u00a0\nThe conch shell sounds you heard were research recordings of the approximately 3,000-year-old Titanostrombus galeatus conch shell horn\u2014excavated in 2018 by John Rick and a team from the UNESCO World Heritage archaeological site Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar, in Per\u00fa. You can read more about that research at the Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar Archaeological Acoustics project website.\nNational Geographic Explorer Jahawi Bertolli is collecting the sounds of rock gongs from all over the African continent. Learn more about his rock project on Jahawi\u2019s website.\nFlutist Anna Potengowski specializes in recreating the sounds of ancient flutes.

                "summary": "Go behind the yellow border to meet the family that made National Geographic an American institution. Gilbert M. Grosvenor\u2019s 60-year career followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather\u2014but he learned that sometimes he had to do things his own way. In his new memoir, A Man of the World, Grosvenor recounts a crucial decision that made him rethink the way National Geographic covers the world. Grosvenor also shares an unforgettable conversation with Jacques Cousteau and how he witnessed Jane Goodall\u2019s transformation from unknown young scientist to, well, Jane Goodall.\nFor more information on this episode, visit natgeo.com/overheard.\nWant more?\nCheck out Gil Grosvenor\u2019s new memoir, A Man of the World: My Life at National Geographic.\nFrom his first day of work in 1899, Gil\u2019s grandfather, Gilbert H. Grosvenor, put National Geographic on the map. A behind-the-scenes photo from our archives shows Grosvenor testing a state-of-the-art camera in 1913.\nGil\u2019s commitment to environmental storytelling is now a part of National Geographic\u2019s DNA. See how we continue that legacy with initiatives like Planet or Plastic and our special issue, Saving Forests.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAlso explore:\nLearn more about seminal explorers Jacques Cousteau and Jane Goodall in our previous episodes, \u201cThe gateway to secret underwater worlds\u201d and \u201cThe next generation\u2019s champion of chimps.\u201d\nSubscribers can also read about the development of Cousteau\u2019s Aqua-Lung, which threw open the undersea world, and revisit Goodall\u2019s groundbreaking 1963 National Geographic article, \u201cMy Life With Wild Chimpanzees.\u201d\nLearn more about your ad choices.
