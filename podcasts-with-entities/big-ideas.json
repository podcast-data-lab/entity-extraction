Socrates, Aristotle and even Shakespeare wrote of the impulsiveness and peer influence of adolescents. Once, hormones were blamed. Now, MRIs tell us their brains haven\u2019t finished developing - in key areas associated with much-maligned teenage behaviour. These include planning, self-awareness, inhibiting inappropriate actions and even understanding other people. So, given the brain changes through adolescence, how might the pandemic impact its development, along with teenage mental health?"
