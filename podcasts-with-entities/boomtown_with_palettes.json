    "description": "In a rugged corner of West Texas, billionaire wildcatters and roughnecks are fueling an oil boom so big it\u2019s reshaping our climate, our economy, and our geopolitics. This modern-day gold rush has sent both big oil companies and scrappy start-ups scrambling to secure a piece of the action. Texas Monthly\u2019s Christian Wallace follows characters along every rung of the oil field ladder, from the executive cutting billion-dollar deals to the itinerant pipeline worker risking life and limb, and from the traveling exotic dancer following the trail of money to those who worry that our planet is on a path to destruction. Meet the people cashing in and those just trying to get by as the world around them is turned upside down.\n\n\"A beautiful ride filled with levity, even as it delivers troubling forecasts for the future\" - The Atlantic\n\n2021 Webby Award Honoree, Podcast Documentary",

This modern-day gold rush has sent both big oil companies and scrappy start-ups scrambling to secure a piece of the action. Texas Monthly\u2019s Christian Wallace follows characters along every rung of the oil field ladder, from the executive cutting billion-dollar deals to the itinerant pipeline worker risking life and limb, and from the traveling exotic dancer following the trail of money to those who worry that our planet is on a path to destruction. Meet the people cashing in and those just trying to get by as the world around them is turned upside down.\n\n\"A beautiful ride filled with levity, even as it delivers troubling forecasts for the future\" - The Atlantic\n\n2021 Webby Award Honoree, Podcast Documentary"
