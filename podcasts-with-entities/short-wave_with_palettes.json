Along the way, they fend off, make friends with, and unearth secrets about the curious creatures who call this place home. There's the filterlopes, six-legged deer-forms with fan-like antennae. Or scouts, squishy blue balls with 12 elastic limbs. But as fantastical as these creatures sound, each one is grounded in the physics and biology of its real-world counterpart.<br><br>Enter married couple Elizabeth Rega and Stuart Sumida, professors of anatomy and paleontology, respectively. They've worked as science consultants on more than 70 films, from 'Ratatouille' to 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' Film crews bring the duo onboard as biology experts, to help animators figure out how their animal creations \u2014 and sometimes their imaginary beasts \u2014 should look and move. But 'Strange World' may be their biggest undertaking yet; Elizabeth and Stuart entered at the earliest stages of production to help envision the kinds of creatures that would fill this world with science and wonder. <br><br>Short Wave's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/1082524708/aaron-scott\">Aaron Scott</a> talks to <a href=\"https://www.westernu.edu/bios/?bio=erega\">Elizabeth Rega</a> and <a href=\"https://www.csusb.edu/we-define-the-future/spotlight/532718\">Stuart Sumida</a> about their experiences as science consultants on film sets, and the science fueling Disney's imagined new world.",

But it is only one instrument, and scientists all over the world have to share. The JWST's managers received more than 1,600 research proposals for what the telescope should look at. \nWhen an astronomer or a team does get some much-coveted telescope time, they currently get exclusive access to whatever data they collect for a full year. But there is a movement in astronomy to make most results open-access right away. That might speed up the pace of scientific discoveries and open up the data to a much wider set of researchers. On the other hand, some astronomers worry that instant open access would mostly benefit researchers who already have advantages. \nIn this episode, NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce talks with Short Wave scientist in residence Regina G. Barber, who has firsthand experience competing for telescope time, about who gets dibs on the data, and how that could affect equity in astronomy.",

Host Aaron Scott talked with journalist Abby Ohlheiser about their reporting trips to a Forensic Osteology Research Station and an anatomy lab to learn how donated bodies help everyone from surgeons to law enforcement to forensic archeologists do their jobs. And while this episode might not be for the squeamish, Abby says these spaces of death are not morbid. Instead, they are surprisingly peaceful.

With likely weeks still to go before infections with this variant reach their peak, the message is get vaccinated and get boosted.  Emily Kwong talks to Short Wave regular Allison Aubrey about what researchers know about omicron's severity and how the vaccines are changing health outcomes. They also talk about COVID-19 and children. And, they'll talk about some strategies to figure out how to live with the virus circulating, possibly for years to come.\nWrite us with your omicron questions at shortwave@npr.org.",
