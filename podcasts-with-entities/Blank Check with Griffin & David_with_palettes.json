Wikipedia-cited \u201cIn The Cut\u201d stan Jourdain Searles joins us to unpack Jane Campion\u2019s unjustly maligned erotic thriller. What happens to actresses once they turn 40? Would this movie have fared better with audiences if - instead of America\u2019s Sweetheart Meg Ryan - it starred an edgier Nicole Kidman as originally planned? Do you remember the SCANDAL when Meg Ryan cheated on Dennis Quaid with Russell Crowe?

Ben goes Hollywood (actually, \u201cHosleywood\u201d) to record with Emily Yoshida - the Mother of Blankies herself - *in person* in Los Angeles, and the gang debates possible names for the series. We landed on \u201cThey Podcast\u201d - which is a departure from Griffin\u2019s far sweatier suggestions. Join us as we set the table for Carpenter\u2019s filmography, and go deep on this film, which could also just be called \u201cSpace Dirtbags,\u201d per Emily.\n\n\nJoin our Patreon at patreon.com/blankcheck\n\nFollow us @blankcheckpod on Twitter and Instagram!\nBuy some real nerdy merch at shopblankcheckpod.myshopify.com",

Having reviewed that theatrical cut, Griffin and David revisit this film with returning guest Esther Zuckerman and discuss the lost, coveted musical cut of I\u2019ll Do Anything in a special bonus episode. But what would the child of Albert Brooks and Julie Kavner sound like? Why does Griffin insist on singing the horrid song \u201cYou Are The Best?\u201d Is this episode haunted? Together they go through all the musical numbers and try to decide if this version of the movie makes it any less worse.",

From Ewan McGregor\u2019s Obi-Wan Kenobi as most improved to Christopher Lee killing it as Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus to the amazing voice acting of Ron Falk as THE BEST CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE: DEXTER JETTSTER!\r\n\r\nHow do the boys rankings of some actors compare to the last review? Do their critiques take into account the once again overwhelming criticism that revolved around this film?\r\n\r\nPlus, assessing director\u2019s body of work such as Joel Schumacher, apparently Michael Jackson wanted to be Jar Jar Binks and remember thespians don\u2019t blink!"

He wondered to himself in the rain: why did Sifo-Dyas place an order for a clone army 10 years ago? Why was a bounty hunter named Jango Fett chosen as the clone specimen? Who deleted Kamino from the archives?\r\n\r\nAnd then the film goes on to answer none of these questions.\r\n\r\nThis week Griffin and David look at the Obi-Wan Kenobi space noir story line, including, meeting 50\u2019s diner purveyor and forensics expert Dexter Jettster, Jedi librarian Jocasta Nu, and discuss at length the logistics of a planet that specializes in cloning."
