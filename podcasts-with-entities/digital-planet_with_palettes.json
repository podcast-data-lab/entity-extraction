New research shows that binaural beats -  illusionary tones created by the brain when the brain hears two different tones in each ear \u2013 can change someone\u2019s emotional state.  The work, published in Drug and Alcohol Review, shows for the first time that people use binaural beats to relax, fall asleep and even to try to get a psychedelic drug high.  BBC\u2019s R&D Audio team have created a binaural beat soundscape especially for Digital Planet and we speak to Dr Alexia Maddox, a tech sociologist, one of the researchers behind the study.\n\nPublishing via What\u2019s App \u2013 getting female authors recognised in Zimbabwe \nGetting a book deal may seem like an impossible dream for many budding authors, but in Zimbabwe, for many female writers, this is a reality. Linda Mujuru, a senior reporter for Global Press Journal, tells us how most publishers are struggling in Zimbabwe due to the dire economic situation over the last twenty years and why so many authors have turned to social media as their only way of telling their stories.  Samantha Rumbidzai Vazhure set up her own publishing house in the UK as she could not get her work printed. She reads one of her poems in Shona, a native Zimbabwean language,  and explains how she now looks for fellow female authors online and publishes their work too.\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari.\n\n\nStudio Manager: Giles Aspen\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image: Music in the mind concept.

They are calling for an immediate suspension of the technology as well as compensation for moral damages to the rights of passengers, however the company denies they are using the technology for facial recognition.\n\nHow to spot disinformation in wartime\nHave you seen the video on TikTok of a Russian paratrooper recording himself while jumping out of a plane as part of the invasion of Ukraine? Well it is not that at all \u2013 it is actually from 2015. But how can you check images and videos that pop up in your social media feeds? Reverse image search it on Google to see where else it has been posted, says Dr Shelby Grossman from the Stanford Internet Institute.  She tells Gareth a whole host of tips to help tell the difference between what is fake and what is real online about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBiodegradable soft robotics\nSoft robots are seen by many scientists as the future of human-robot interaction, but one setback is that the more malleable material needs replacing as it wears out quicker than rigid material more often associated with robots.  Now a team of scientists has developed a translucent soft and tactile robotic finger, and it\u2019s biodegradable.  Looking for inspiration in the kitchen the team developed this biogel from gelatine by modifying a 3D printer.  The material is in fact edible \u2013 which will make future soft robotics safe for young children. One of the authors, Professor Martin Kaltenbrunner from the Institute of Experiment Physics at Linz University, tells Gareth why the team was keen to make machines out of biodegradable material. \n\nPresented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari.\n\nStudio Manager: Giles Aspen\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Photo: People moving and traveling inside of the Metro subway system in Sao Paulo Brazil.

That\u2019s what happened to about 350 patients around the world, as the medical start-up company behind a particular implant called Second Sight medical products has hit financial difficulties.  Eliza Strickland and Mark Harris from IEEE Spectrum first reported on the story and tell us what happened.\n\niPhone 13 Pro Max \u2013 the latest in ophthalmic medicine?\nAs recently as February 2021, medical journal \"The Lancet\" reported that \"Almost everyone will experience impaired vision or an eye condition during their lifetime and require eye care services\".  Chances are then, that at some point, you'll be visiting an eye doctor.  But what sort of equipment would you expect them to use to examine your eyes?  Well, you might be surprised, as our reporter Fern Lulham found out.  This is the final in Fern\u2019s series on blind tech.\n\nWhat might happen with our COVID data?\nSince the pandemic started, an unprecedented amount of data about our health and our whereabouts has been collected by governments and private companies \u2013 but what will happen to this data and do we have any control over it?  Dr. Stephanie Hare, is about to publish her new book \u201cTechnology Is Not Neutral: A Short Guide to Technology Ethics\u201d where she discusses this problem.  \n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington.\n\nStudio Manager:  Bob Nettles\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image: Getty Images)"

                "summary": "The first-ever robotic surgery without a human surgeon guiding it has been successfully performed at Johns Hopkins University. The Smart Tissues Autonomous Robot (STAR) completed a keyhole procedure called intestinal anastomosis \u2013 the sewing together of two sections of soft bowel - on pigs.  More than a million of these surgeries are performed each year in the US alone and they need to be carried out very precisely and accurately to avoid potentially fatal complications.  Professor Axel Krieger, the mechanical engineer on the team, tells Gareth how this is a major advancement in robotic surgery.\n\nSingapore Surveillance \nSingapore often introduces innovative tech to its citizens, but there is a lack of transparency about the way the data is collected and used. As public tech becomes more affordable it is becoming increasingly available. While the hope is it will solve complex social problems there is no transparency over the algorithms used. This means we don\u2019t know the kind of prejudices, privileges, and assumptions being built in. Without intervention, societal prejudices will continue to be perpetuated. Peter Guest from the Rest of World website has been looking into the dangers of public tech in Singapore and beyond. He tells us why tech companies need to be more transparent.\n\nunReal City\nBackstage at the Brighton Dome looks more like the technical suite of a TV studio than a theatre, as technicians watch multiple screens showing the audience and actors in different rooms - and showing a variety of feeds from their VR headsets - because this piece of immersive theatre, unReal City, takes place in both physical and virtual reality. Reporter Claire Jordan has been meeting with the Director of dreamthinkspeak and disabled artists from Access All Areas \u2013 the two companies behind the production - which explores if it\u2019s easier or better to connect in the flesh or as an avatar and if links are stronger in reality or could the Metaverse allow us to re-invent ourselves.\n\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson.\n\nStudio Manager: Giles Aspen\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\nPhoto: The smart tissue autonomous robot performing laparoscopic anastomosis.

The underwater volcanic eruption severed the country\u2019s only underwater network cable and ash clouds have made satellite connectivity impossible. Professor Nicole Starosielski from NYU, an expert in underwater connectivity and author of \u201cThe undersea network\u201d, joins us on the show. An underwater cable is severed every three days somewhere in the world, yet the network has the capacity to usually cope with this disruption.  Many developing countries do not have this extra capacity as they cannot afford it. Professor Starosielski argues that richer nations should step up and fund this lack of spare connectivity.\n\nVirtual IT brain drain in Argentina\nIT workers in Argentina are being enticed by US and European tech companies to work remotely for them, by offering very attractive salaries and remote working contracts.  Local IT businesses are struggling to retain workers as they leave for salaries in US$ or Euros that can be four times what they are currently earning.  And this is what is different about this type of employment, unlike outsourced IT workers in India or Africa, the employees are not working on local conditions.  As reporter Lucila Pelletieri from Global Press Journal tells Gareth, the loss of local talent will impact not only the country\u2019s IT companies but potentially the economy as well.\n\n\nRobot training made easy\nWe hear about machine learning all the time, but how does a machine actually learn? Say it\u2019s a robot that you need to teach to perform a task in a factory, or even in your home. Well, it\u2019s ok if you happen to be an ace programmer and are happy to dash off a load of computer code. But at the Robot Learning Lab at Imperial College London, they want to make it easier for us to train the machines - as easy as grabbing the robot\u2019s arm and moving it through the task, so that next time, the bot does the movement itself. The Lab presented its latest work at a robot learning conference just before Christmas. The lab\u2019s director is Dr. Edward Johns and Gareth has been to pay him \u2013 and his robot \u2013 a visit. \n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington.\n\nStudio Manager: Giles Aspen\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image: Underwater fiber-optic cable on ocean floor.

                "summary": "Twenty-five years ago the world wide web was 2.5 terabytes and you needed to dial-up via your phone line to get onto it, so Brewster Kahle decided to set up a project to archive what was out there already.  Now the Internet Archive consists of more than 588 billion web pages, as well as 28 million books and texts, 14 million audio items, and 580,000 software titles, making it one of the world\u2019s largest digital libraries.  Brewster tells Gareth how they\u2019ve done this \u2013 especially making content that runs on old and absolute technologies accessible today.\n\nThe Future of Text\nWhy is our tech for text so simple and boring \u2013 in effect it\u2019s little more than an electronic copy of a paper page?  But this changes with new technology bringing books and documents to life with interaction and metadata tags that allow you to search, source and organise text as never before.  Father of the internet, Vint Cerf and Frode Hegland, Founder of the Augmented Text Company, are on the show to tell us why we\u2019re now able to move on from using the click of a mouse to manage our text. \n\n\nMoonshot \u2013 tech used to learn more about neglected diseases is fighting COVID\nThe COVID Moonshot project began as a virtual collaboration during UK 2020 lockdown.  Scientists, academics, researchers & students started a twitter-fuelled race against the clock to identify new molecules that could block SARS-CoV-2 and develop treatments that would be globally affordable and easily manufactured for most vulnerable communities.

                "summary": "PIX instant payment limits to reduce kidnappings\nLast year the PIX instant payment system was introduced in Brazil. It currently has 112 million registered users \u2013 that\u2019s 62% of the population. It\u2019s proving incredibly popular and is allowing the 40 million unbanked people in the country access to electronic payments.  Unfortunately its popularity has also led to significant issues \u2013 namely ransom demands by kidnappers that can be paid immediately. By lowering the payment limit and stopping night payments, it\u2019s hoped this will curb the problem. Silvia Bassi, who runs the tech website The Shift in Brazil, is on the show.\n\nBitcoin mining in Navajo Nation \u2013 crypto-colonialism\nIn the past traditional mining often took advantage of local people living near the mine, now something similar may be happening with cryptocurrencies. A bitcoin mine in the Four Corners region of New Mexico which belongs to the Navajo nation is causing controversy. It consumes enough to power 19,600 homes, yet many local residents lack water and electricity. The scheme was originally set up with the Navajo\u2019s support but there is opposition from some local people. Mining companies argue though that investing in their schemes will ultimately reap financial rewards for the local people.

We ask about the tech that is involved and if it\u2019s possible to control it.\n\nEating out with an app\nSo COVID has brought about significant changes in how we order our food \u2013 not only have takeaway apps increased significantly in popularity but food ordering in restaurants in a number of countries was only possible thanks to our smart phones. As restrictions in some parts of the world ease, many restaurants are reluctant to go back to the traditional way of running their businesses. Gareth and Bill meet Dominic Jones, CEO of JPRestaurants in Jersey, who explains how ordering on an app has streamlined his business, allowed them to open earlier than they thought they could during the pandemic and how customers have taken to it. Gareth and Bill even sneak into the kitchens to see how the tech allows the food to be prepared incredibly quickly.\n\nTikTok promotes COVID vaccine misinformation within minutes of signing up\nNewsguard, who provides a browser extension that flags up untrustworthy information, has found that the incredibly popular app TikTok (which has a huge following amongst under 18\u2019s) posts COVID vaccine misinformation videos to children within minutes of them signing up to the service. Alex Cadier, Managing Director of NewsGuard in the UK, is on the show to explain how they discovered that children were being targeted.\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson.\n\nStudio Manager: Giles Aspen\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image: Unidentifiable hacker cracking a computer code in the dark\nCredit: PeopleImages/Getty Images)"

Combining Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things technology sent the driver's location and video to the company's control centre who alerted law enforcement, allowing them to track him down and return him safely the same day. To find out more we spoke to Romil Bahl CEO of KORE Wireless the company behind the technology and Niv Yarimi CEO of KABAT, the fleet company whose driver was kidnapped.\n\nProtecting the Amazon from deforestation with tech\nProviding indigenous communities in the Amazon with technology, including satellite images, maps, smart phones and GPS, can reduce deforestation. Data delivered to remote communities on USB by couriers navigating the Amazon river enabled communities to monitor for forest loss. Connecting deforestation alerts with indigenous communities means local patrols can guide themselves to areas thought to be undergoing unauthorised deforestation. In turn this allows communities to defend their land from deforestation.

Mostly developed to try and treat conditions including Parkinson's and epilepsy, there are concerns however about what might be created in the future. Could future smart devices in our homes read our thoughts?  Chile hopes to protect neurorights through modification of their constitution.

While the Games Industry is ploughing huge amounts of money into developing the spatial decentralised web (web 3.0), cultural institutions are lagging behind. Kay Watson, Head of the Arts Technologies team at the Serpentine Galleries, tells us more about the tech they are using to be part of this new metaverse.\n\nIt\u2019s the 30th anniversary of the first public website. Composer Kieran Brunt is back to tell us about his latest creation. This new work explores how the internet has dramatically reshaped our lives over the past 30 years. Woven around personal stories Kieran Brunt features electronic and vocal elements that explore the impact the internet has had on all our lives.  The full Virtual Symphony can be heard on BBC Radio 3 on Sunday 18th July 2021.\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington\n\nStudio Manager: \nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n\n(Image: Getty Images)",

They have just been awarded almost $5m for the project. Remy the community lead at Common Voice Kinyarwanda and Chenai chair special adviser for Africa Innovation at the Mozilla Foundation tells us more about the work.\n\nFederated Learning\nAs more of our data is processed through machine learning systems, Dr Nic Lane, of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory, explains a new way of processing and using our data without the need to send it through data centres. One solution to reduce the impact is federated learning \u2013 where data is processed on the edge, on your device, rather than being centralised. Not only does this reduce the environmental impact of computing, but it also has benefits for privacy and opens up opportunities for data sharing between companies.\n\nElectronic VR socks\nReporter Claire Jordan has been investigating a novel approach to \u201cwalking\u201d in a virtual reality. Existing ways are expensive and need considerable space to function, as well as having a less than satisfactory user experience. A new technology being developed by Professor Yusuke Matsuda of Toyohashi University of Technology in Japan could expand the reach of immersive VR movement to a much wider audience and deliver a better user experience than current solutions. The user wears electronic socks that create the feeling of walking in VR even though the user is sitting down. This could allow users to spend much longer in VR and also allow people with mobility issues to move around more freely, and possibly feel as though they are moving, in VR.                                    \n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson. \nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image: Mozilla\u2019s Common Voice project.

Lead author Dr Matti Vuorre explains how they analysed data from 430,000 UK and US teenagers and found little or no associations between adolescents\u2019 tech use and mental health problems. But he says the data they were using is limited. Ideally, he wants to use the data that big tech companies hold on our tech use. The findings are published in the journal Clinical Psychological Science.\n\nAfrica Teen Geeks and Africa Tech Week\nFounder and CEO of Africa Teen Geeks, Lindiwe Matlali, discusses her work in technology education and improving access for African children. During the pandemic she set up online schooling for South Africa, reaching over 600,000 children, and is working with Unicef to improve access to coding and robotics education across the continent. She also runs the \u2018Knit2Code\u2019 scheme that teaches women python coding through knitting, empowering mothers and grandmothers to support their daughters\u2019 technology education.\n\nAI colourisation of historical photos\nGwen Katz, a historical novelist and games designer, explains the problems of colourising historical photos. To test the efficacy of colourisation AI she compared the artificial colourisation of black and white photos with their colour originals and found that the bright colours of the original images were lost when colourised by an algorithm. Marta Mrak from BBC R&D discusses how the problem of loss of colours is being solved, by providing the algorithms with reference images, as well as future challenges for designing neural networks to colourise film. \n\nPresenter: Gareth Mitchell \nWith expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington\n\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Photo: Two girls wearing face masks looking at their phone.

Kisa Mfalila, Regional Climate and Environment Specialist for Asia and the Pacific region at IFAD, explains how the app works.\n\nComputer Modelling of the Canon of English Literature \nThe Canon of English Literature \u2013 the books that are considered to be worthy of studying - are overwhelmingly written by white men, with books written by female novelists often considered less literary in comparison.  Now, a new project \u201cNovel Perceptions: Towards an Inclusive Canon\u201d aims to use computer modelling to investigate the public\u2019s reading preferences.  It's led by Professor Sebastian Groes from the University of Wolverhampton, who has just launched a Reader Review survey asking for responses to 400 recent novels.  The novels will also undergo computer analysis that will look at sentence length, vocabulary and grammar difficulty to see if an algorithm can identify a best seller.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)                                         \n\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson. \n\nStudio Manager: Nigel Dix\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz"

These are often taken some time after the crime has happened \u2013 but what if it was possible to take a witness statement very quickly using AI chatbots?  Dr Julia Shaw is on the programme discussing her latest research into using an AI chatbot in reporting harassment in the workplace.  Not only are statements taken more quickly, they are done better by a machine than a person, as people can interrupt, misinterpret, judge or incorrectly record statements.  The AI chatbot sticks to a script and allows the witness to do the same.\n\nMachine learning to understand Tinnitus\nAI is helping to advance research into tinnitus, a condition often described as a ringing, buzzing or hissing in the ears, which affects up to 1 in 5 adults.

Use a GPS grazing collar.  This technology has been developed by Norwegian firm NoFence and uses GPS to track individual animals and stop them crossing boundaries that have been progammed using a mapping app on a smart phone. The collars emit a bleeping noise that gets louder as animals reach a virtual fence and will receive a small electric shock if they cross it (this is much smaller than one from an electric fence).  Electric fences are expensive and difficult to fit in remote terrains and these GPS collars allow farmers to regularly change their grazing sites.  We hear about the tech from UK manager of NoFence Synne Foss Budal and about the conservation benefits from Emma Wright from North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty who is trailing the collars in their upland pastures. \n\nUbiquitous Connectivity and cybersecurity\nLate last year the World Economic Forum and the University of Oxford, released a report on the future of cybersecurity. They identified four emerging technology trends that could endanger security in the digital world within the next 5 to 10 years. In a series of reports Digital Planet\u2019s Florian Bohr looks into each of these cybersecurity threats of the future. This week, we hear about how the sheer amount of digital connections between devices, services, and people is an inherent cybersecurity risk. \n\n(Image: Getty Images)                                   \n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari\n\nStudio Manager: John Boland\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz",

In the last year social media manipulation campaigns have been recorded in 81 countries, up from 70 countries in 2019 and most of the countries involved have deployed disinformation campaigns. The main author of the report, Dr. Samantha Bradshaw is on the show.\n\nGPS Grazing Collars \nHow do you control where your animals graze if you can\u2019t fit a fence to keep them contained to a certain area? Use a GPS grazing collar.  This technology has been developed by Norwegian firm NoFence and uses GPS to track individual animals and stop them crossing boundaries that have been progammed using a mapping app on a smart phone. The collars emit a bleeping noise that gets louder as animals reach a virtual fence and will receive a small electric shock if they cross it (this is much smaller than one from an electric fence).

Jennifer Silva, an associate professor of Paediatric Surgery, and her husband Jon Silva, an associate professor of biomedical engineering, used a Microsoft HoloLens headset to give surgeons real-time information about the electrical signals passing through a patient\u2019s hearts during surgery.\n\nMapping earthquakes with localised EDGE computing\nObserving natural phenomena like earthquakes and volcanoes relies on data from the earth\u2019s satellite network. As the volume of this satellite data grows it becomes harder for scientists to get it back to Earth. EDGE computing offers a solution. The opposite of cloud computing, it keeps data near the source by processing it on-site and only sending back relevant or interesting information. Digital Planet reporter Hannah Fisher finds out more.\n \n\n\n(Image: Getty Images)                                         \n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson.\n\n\n\nStudio Manager: Tim Heffer\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz"

The internet moves the data around, but the web is the space in which we humans have experiences, think of the web as a sort of super app. \n\nWe're interested in the underlying technology, in that it facilitates the movement of data that makes the web possible. But from the human side, we're interested in our interaction with each other as made possible by the web, so how do we understand it in its totality rather than thinking about it as a collection of websites?  Did the inventors of the internet foresee how it could be used now \u2013 as a force of good and change but also as a way of spreading hate and misinformation?  By studying Web Science could the internet be made better for humanity in the future?  \n\nJoining us from the WebSci 2020 Conference are: \u201cFather of the Internet\u201d Vint Cerf, Executive Director, Web Science Institute Wendy Hall, Director of the Ada Lovelace Institute in Cambridge Carly Kind and JP Rangaswami former Chief Data Officer and Head of Innovation of Deutsche Bank Chief Scientist at BT.\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary by Bill Thompson.\n\nStudio Manager: Duncan Hannant\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\nMain image credit: Getty Images"

We hear from a listener whose mother passed away with her children by her side via Facetime and how they then moved their traditional American-Irish funeral practices online.  In India people of all religions are facing huge disruptions to their traditional burials and are taking tech into their own hands to share their experiences.  In some developed countries funeral businesses are using cutting edge tech including sophisticated recording set ups in places of worship to bring together mourners from across the world. People are moving more and more online not only with virtual memorials, RFID tags on gravestones and also ceremonies in gaming environments including Animal Crossing.  And we find out more about the Reimagine Festival that\u2019s about to start.  The now virtual event explores death during COVID-19 and we see how people are determining their digital legacies after they die.\n\nGuests include Khyati Tripathi, a PhD student at the University of Delhi, who tells how the restrictions in the pandemic have changed funerals in the country, Candi Cann, Associate Professor of Religion at Baylor University, and co-creator of the Virtual Funeral Collective and Dr Stacey Pitsillides, a Senior Research Fellow at Northumbria University who is organising the virtual festival \u201cReimagine: Life, Loss, & Love\u201d. \n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with studio commentary from Ghislaine Boddington.\n\n\n(Image: Mourners live stream a funeral to family back in Nepal and to those waiting just outside.

                "summary": "Facial recognition \u2013 what\u2019s the future for the tech with the big names pulling out? \nMost of the big tech companies have now declared they will not sell facial recognition tech to police, but will this mean that police forces will stop using this tech? There are many smaller companies that have so far not declared their intentions and others are clearly breaking the few regulations in place by using people\u2019s images without consent. It\u2019s widely known that facial recognition technology is racially and sexually biased, and there is little, if any, evidence that this tech does help to reduce crime levels. Dr.Stephanie Hare discusses what might now happen with this tech. \n\nOnline gambling surge during COVID-19\nLockdowns are making many players and gamblers move to online gambling platforms, the big issue here is that they do not come under strict regulations like their real world counterparts.  Silvia Lazzaris and Katie Kropshofer report on this growing problem.  Can  you protect a rising number of online gamblers, many of whom suffer from addiction and are bunkered in their homes, from targeted advertising and fraud? And how can regulation catch up with this sudden shift to the online world? \n\nWill gaze tech replace touch tech in times of the pandemic? \nAs computer processing speeds continue to increase, so does the versatility and accuracy of gaze tech \u2013 using your eyes instead of a computer mouse or touchpad.  Dr. David Souto, from the University of Leicester, explains that as our eye muscles do not tire this technology has untapped benefits.  His work is part of the British Academy Virtual Summer Showcase which goes live online this week.\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington.\n\n(Image: Human face recognition scanning system illustration.

                "summary": "Contact tracing is an essential part of controlling the Coronavirus pandemic but how should this data be collected and shared?  In previous pandemics the tech wasn\u2019t advanced enough to be used widely, but now country by country new contact tracing apps are appearing.  But what about our privacy, should our personal health information be so easily available and potentially be unsecure?  Some of the tech giants have even developed new protocols to anonymise our data \u2013 but not all governments think this will work?  Journalist Timandra Harkness tells us what types of apps are being used where and about the tech behind them.\n\nMaking computers intuitive\nIs it possible to make computers intuitive like us?

The spacecraft is about 18 billion kilometres from Earth, so sending a command to it takes 17 hours.\n\nAlexa: save my life please\nCould personal assistants like Alexa and Siri save your life? Research in the journal BMJ innovations has assessed how good the top four voice assistants are at giving sound medical advice \u2013 the results were mixed. \n\nDrones mesh it up in Vietnam\nManaging a natural disaster like a flood is so difficult because often there are many unknowns - responders urgently need real time information on water levels in the swollen rivers for instance. Installing monitoring kit across long stretches of river is expensive and the sensors need replacing regularly. So how about deploying a squadron of drones to pick up the data instead? That has been happening in a trial in Vietnam. Dr Trung Duong, at Queen\u2019s University Belfast tells us more.\n\nPurrfect robots\nDo you need a robot that can work in the dark or a dangerous environment? Give it whiskers! After all, some bristles and a snout work well for the likes of dogs, mice and shrews. So researchers at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK have spent hours watching whiskers in the wild and are now switching the twitching to robots in the lab. \n\n(Photo: Voyager spacecraft.

Michael Kremer, a 2019 Economics Nobel Prize winner developed Precision Agriculture for Development (PAD) to give farmers in developing countries advice on how to improve their yields. He and Owen Barder, CEO of PAD, tell Digital Planet how it works. \n\nTo reduce failures on surveillance or delivery missions, drones need to be monitored effectively. Karen Willcox at the Oden Institute of the University of Texas in Austin explains how her team has found a way to send back real time data using sensors that create a digital twin of the drone, which can show where fatigue and stress may cause damage during the flight.\n\nRacist and sexist biases within algorithms are causing concern, especially considering they are making many decisions in our lives. Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and AI at the University of Sheffield in the UK, and he thinks it\u2019s time to halt this decision making until it can be properly regulated, or it will have major, real-life effects on all of us.  \n\n\n(Photo: Farmer carrying silage and talking on phone.

Hyp3r was scraping profiles, copying photos and siphoning off data supposed to be deleted after 24 hours, according to Business Insider investigation. As Stephanie Hare explains, millions of users have been targeted. \n\nBreaking Silences \u2013 Rwanda\u2019s first podcast\nOn DP\u2019s recent trip to Rwanda Gareth met two young women who have created the first ever podcast in the country.  \u201cBreaking Silences\u201d is a podcast that brings you conversation around things happening in African Society particularly in Rwanda.  It\u2019s a really lively show and the hosts are not afraid to tackle subjects that no one else has spoken about publically before...\n\nFire Hackathon package\nOur reporter Tom Stephens has been to a hackathon aimed at radically rethinking the way that fire safety is incorporated into the construction of buildings.  The idea for the event came about in the summer of 2017 following the Grenfell Tower fire. \n\n(Photo: Instagram application seen on a phone screen.

He spoke to us on why he believes game design is so beneficial for the young people of Suffolk. \t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(Photo caption: \u201cAnalysing the App\u2019s binary software code\u201d credit: \u00a9 Mareen Meyer )    \n\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz"
