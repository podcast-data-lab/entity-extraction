Now scientists and engineers in the UK have used motion sensors to capture the way patients move.  They processed this data through new AI medical technology that they say can predict disease progression and significantly increase the efficiency of clinical trials in these conditions.  Treatments are desperately needed as both diseases can lead to paralysis and currently there are often not enough patients for clinical trials.  Dr. Valeria Ricotti, honorary clinical lecturer at the UCL GOS ICH and lead author of the studies is on the show to tell us more.\n\nSony\u2019s new game controller for disabled gamers \nOur gaming correspondent Chris Berrow reports on Sony\u2019s new \u201cProject Leonardo\u201d, its PlayStation 5 controller for disabled gamers.  The company teamed up with accessibility experts and charities to design the modular controller which can be adapted in many different ways to allow as many people as possible to use it.

Agriculture as an industry is keen to clean up its act on emissions, so what could be better than an electric tractor. But will it be able to manage all that farming throws at it? Gareth puts the questions to Praveen Penmetsa who is co-founder and CEO of Monarch Tractors which recently launched a \u2018Smart Tractor\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s no use having a tractor smart or not, if your crop has been devastated by insects. Pests destroy up to 40 percent of global crops and cost 220 billion US dollars of losses worldwide annually, according to The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the FAO.  Matej Stefancic the Chief Executive Officer of Trapview a Slovenian company, has developed intelligent insect traps.  He explains to Gareth how they monitor bugs in the field, in an effort to cut the need for indiscriminate use of insecticides.\n\nAnd once you\u2019ve grown your crop you need to harvest it, and in the case of soft fruit it needs careful picking and packing for the market. With a shortage of skilled labour around the world a robot picker capable of matching a human would be ideal. Well, one developed in Britain is currently doing just that on a farm in Portugal, and fruit picked by it could be on sale in supermarkets very soon. The academic founder and Chief Science Officer of Fieldwork Robotics Martin Stoelen is the brains behind this robot and he explains to Gareth the challenges involved in developing it.\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson. \n\nStudio Manager: Steve Greenwood\nProducers: Ania Lichtarowicz and Alun Beach\n\n(Image: Smart Farming graphic\nCredit: Jackie Niam/Getty Images)",

The chip will allow researchers to watch a \u2018heart attack\u2019 as it happens, which isn\u2019t possible in animals, and see how damage is being done.

Users have reported money missing from their accounts \u2013 the transactions should have been secured with a one-time passcode but according to social media they we processed without permission.  Shopee have now stopped customers from linking their accounts to the platform directly.  The company also denies they were hacked and that they had taken the decision to stop bank transfers last month.  It also says that the customers were probably victims of phishing scams. The BBC\u2019s Tossapol Chaisamritpol has been covering the story and joins us from the Bangkok Bureau.  \n\nFacial recognition plans dropped in Sao Paulo \u2013 for now\nPlans for the controversial facial recognition surveillance system in Sao Paulo have been scrapped \u2013 at least for now.

She has trained a computer algorithm to sing like her \u2013 the cloned voice can sing in any language or style she chooses \u2013 even extending her own vocal range.  The project is called Hollyplus and the digital twin has just released its version of Dolly Parton\u2019s song Jolene.  The real Holly explains how she\u2019s done this.\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson.\n\nStudio Manager:  Sue Maillot\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image: Protest in Iran.

                "summary": "The WEEE forum estimates that of the 16 billion mobile phones in the world about 5.3bn will no longer be in use this year.  Despite being packed with precious metals like gold, silver and palladium and other recyclable parts most will not be disposed of properly.  This mountain of e-waste (that if piled on top of each other would reach 120 times higher than the International Space Station) is only part of e-waste problem with other small consumer electronics e.g. remotes, headphones, clocks, irons etc., being hoarded in even greater numbers than mobiles. Magdalena Charytanowicz from the WEEE forum is on the show and explains the magnitude of the problem and how it needs to be tackled.\n\n\n100 years of the BBC\nAs the BBC starts its 100th anniversary celebrations, we have a report from BBC Northampton\u2019s Martin Heath, who is spending the day at the site of the Daventry transmitting station at Borough Hill. Martin tells us about the history of the station (it was initially was used for long wave, and short wave broadcasting and closed in 1992) and we also speak to one of the engineers who worked there about the technology used.\n\nThe biggest radio telescope in the Northern Hemisphere\nThe NOEMA radio telescope is now the most powerful radio telescope in the northern hemisphere. Twelve antennas in the French Alps will simultaneously detect and measure a large number of signatures of molecules and atoms. More than 5000 scientists from across the world will now be able to observe stars being born, comets, black holes and light from cosmic objects that has been travelling to Earth for more than 13 billion years.  We find out about the tech that is making this possible.\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari.\n\nStudio Manager: Gayl Gordon\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)"

The amount of antibiotics needed is a tiny fraction of the amount currently used to treat this infection intravenously.  The robots are made from algae cells (this allows them to move) covered in antibiotic-filled nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are made with tiny spheres that are coated with the cell membranes of neutrophils \u2013 a type of white blood cell that fights infection and inflammation -  making the microrobots more effective at fighting the lung infection.

A new study published in Science Advances shows that short animated videos could protect people from harmful content.  Controlled experiments where people were shown how misinformation is spread e.g. using emotional language or scapegoating, appeared highly effective in helping people judge what might be fact or fiction on the web. Psychologists worked with Google Jigsaw and tested their experiments in real life by placing them in the ads section on YouTube videos. They saw a  5% impact in being able to spot misinformation and they also reduced sharing frequency.  \n\nThis \u201cpre-bunking\u201d strategy exposes people to tropes and explains how malicious propaganda is spread, so they can better identify online falsehoods. Researchers behind the Inoculation Science project compare it to a vaccine: by giving people a \u201cmicro-dose\u201d of misinformation in advance, it helps prevent them falling for it in future \u2013 an idea based on what social psychologist\u2019s call \u201cinoculation theory\u201d.  Lead author Dr. Jon Roozenbeek is live on the programme to explain why this works and Beth Goldberg from Google talks about their new project to reduce misinformation spread about refugees in central Europe.\n\nIndonesian data breaches\nThere have been five major data breaches in Indonesia this month, three alone in the last fortnight; the personal data of more than 26 million users of state-owned telecommunication provider PT Telkom was allegedly leaked \u2013 but the company denied this.  Last week, foreign companies, including Microsoft and PwC, were also reportedly hit by a data breach. Astudestra Ajengrastri, Deputy Editor in the BBC Jakarta office, is on the show to explain why this is such a huge problem, how little is being done about it and why so many Indonesians seem indifferent to the breaches.\n\nRobotic Dogs\nHave you seen the video of a robotic dog firing a sub-machine gun?  It\u2019s had well over 4 million views. It comes swiftly after reports of robotic dogs being used to patrol the US-Mexican border. But can robotic dogs become our virtual best friend despite them being used by the military and security services?  Reporter Dominic Watters looks at the tech and what these robots are truly capable of (walking on uneven surfaces still needs to be mastered) and could actually be used for the benefit of humankind \u2013 using their sensory systems to navigate dangerous terrains after natural disasters for instance?\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari.\n\nStudio Manager:  Steve Greenwood\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image credit: Screenshot of a video collaboration between Cambridge University, the University of Bristol, and Google Jigsaw)",

                "summary": "Nearly a third of people in India lost money through online fraud in 2020 alone. Of them, it is thought that only 17% saw any returns through redressal mechanisms. Despite this prevalence of scams, reports have shown that the Indian population have got more trusting of unsolicited messages from companies online over the last five years. New Delhi based journalist Mimansa Verma from Quartz has been exploring this problem and joins the programme to discuss.\n \nUltrasound sticker that monitors your heart\nA postage stamp size sticker could give doctors a more detailed picture of our health. Ultrasounds are one of the most common medical diagnostic tools in the world, but they only measure a snapshot in time and rely on the skill of the sonographer. A newly proposed ultrasound patch could record our heart changing shape during exercise, the impact of eating or drinking on our digestive system, and even the flow of blood through veins and arteries. Ghislaine Boddington checks out the tech and how this, and other devices, are giving doctors a much more complete picture of how our bodies work.\n\nFinally getting your slot on the JWST\nMore than twenty years ago, Professor Mark McCaughrean submitted a proposal for observations to be made on a new space telescope. At midnight on August 29th he will finally see the results of his first observations from the James Webb Space Telescope. In the convening years, Prof. McCaughrean has become a scientific advisor for the European Space Agency and a collaborator on the JWST project. He joins the programme to talk about his hopes for observing star and planet formation with the JWST, as well as the tech that underpins the telescope.\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington\n\nStudio Manager:  Duncan Hannant\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image: An Indian man counts Indian rupee currency.

There are many investigators on the internet that are gathering Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT for short, and conduct research and verification, much of it focussed on war zones. The most prominent collective in this field is the NGO Bellingcat, but there is a whole ecosystem of amateur sleuths online. Gareth speaks to Charlotte Godart who leads the volunteer programme at Bellingcat, on how they effectively crowdsource part of their investigations, and we hear from several hobbyists who rose to prominence on Twitter about why they spent much of their free time on this type of research.\n\nData tackling gun violence\nBrazil has a gun violence issue, and a public data issue. In the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, there were, on average, 13 shootings every single day last year, and the only reason we know this is because of open data platform Fogo Cruzado. They collect data in real-time on shootings happening in Rio and other cities across Brazil via their app, social media, and public police reports, and they make that data publicly available for ordinary citizens, organisations, and journalists to use. The founder of Fogo Cruzado, Cec\u00edlia Olliveira, explains how it all works, and how having data can help set the public agenda.\n\nThe blue map: environmentalist action in China\nOnly 10 years ago, Beijing was a city covered in smog with many residents opting to wear pollution masks. Now, the situation has, remarkably, improved, with blue skies being a normal sight. One possible reason for this drastic change is environmentalist Ma Jun, who, in 2006, started the blue map database aggregating government data and making it more easily accessible to the public. Since then, the blue map project has grown into an app that lets users check many types of environmental data and even contribute to the database themselves by simply taking a picture of a dirty river, a cloud of smog, or a factory that isn\u2019t following environmental guidelines. Gareth speaks to Ma Jun, founding director of China\u2019s Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs and founder of the Blue Map, about how this crowdsourcing approach works, and how environmental activism in China differs from Western countries.\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari.\n\nStudio Manager: Michael Millham\nProducer: Florian Bohr\n\n(Image:   Crowd and data                           credit: Getty Images)",

VPN companies in India have sharply criticised the ruling, and some have already exited and pulled their servers out of the country.

Gareth speaks to Ph.D. student Nita Mulliqi about the difficulties of using AI in prostate cancer grading and how a dataset from diverse clinical settings is needed to create effective algorithms.

In a live discussion with tech futurist and metaverse expert Cathy Hackl, video game writer Colin Harvey, and our very own Ghislaine Boddington, we discuss the big issues on the horizon. Who will be creating it and who will have access? Could this lead to harvesting of biometric data? Will all of us actually use the metaverse?\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington.\n\nStudio Manager: Sue Maillot\nProducer: Florian Bohr\n\n(Image: Looking through virtual reality glasses into the metaverse world.

Research scientist Junghyo Yoon is hoping to improve and commercialise the technology in the next couple of years.\n\nMilitary virtual and augmented reality\nMicrosoft has recently been contracted to construct more than 120,000 augmented reality headsets for the U.S. Army.

                "summary": "A number of Brazilian civil rights organisations have filed a civil lawsuit against a company operating the S\u00e3o Paulo metro and their use of facial recognition technology.  They are calling for an immediate suspension of the technology as well as compensation for moral damages to the rights of passengers, however the company denies they are using the technology for facial recognition.\n\nHow to spot disinformation in wartime\nHave you seen the video on TikTok of a Russian paratrooper recording himself while jumping out of a plane as part of the invasion of Ukraine? Well it is not that at all \u2013 it is actually from 2015. But how can you check images and videos that pop up in your social media feeds? Reverse image search it on Google to see where else it has been posted, says Dr Shelby Grossman from the Stanford Internet Institute.  She tells Gareth a whole host of tips to help tell the difference between what is fake and what is real online about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBiodegradable soft robotics\nSoft robots are seen by many scientists as the future of human-robot interaction, but one setback is that the more malleable material needs replacing as it wears out quicker than rigid material more often associated with robots.  Now a team of scientists has developed a translucent soft and tactile robotic finger, and it\u2019s biodegradable.  Looking for inspiration in the kitchen the team developed this biogel from gelatine by modifying a 3D printer.  The material is in fact edible \u2013 which will make future soft robotics safe for young children. One of the authors, Professor Martin Kaltenbrunner from the Institute of Experiment Physics at Linz University, tells Gareth why the team was keen to make machines out of biodegradable material. \n\nPresented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari.\n\nStudio Manager: Giles Aspen\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Photo: People moving and traveling inside of the Metro subway system in Sao Paulo Brazil.

That\u2019s what happened to about 350 patients around the world, as the medical start-up company behind a particular implant called Second Sight medical products has hit financial difficulties.  Eliza Strickland and Mark Harris from IEEE Spectrum first reported on the story and tell us what happened.\n\niPhone 13 Pro Max \u2013 the latest in ophthalmic medicine?\nAs recently as February 2021, medical journal \"The Lancet\" reported that \"Almost everyone will experience impaired vision or an eye condition during their lifetime and require eye care services\".  Chances are then, that at some point, you'll be visiting an eye doctor.  But what sort of equipment would you expect them to use to examine your eyes?  Well, you might be surprised, as our reporter Fern Lulham found out.  This is the final in Fern\u2019s series on blind tech.\n\nWhat might happen with our COVID data?\nSince the pandemic started, an unprecedented amount of data about our health and our whereabouts has been collected by governments and private companies \u2013 but what will happen to this data and do we have any control over it?  Dr. Stephanie Hare, is about to publish her new book \u201cTechnology Is Not Neutral: A Short Guide to Technology Ethics\u201d where she discusses this problem.  \n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington.\n\nStudio Manager:  Bob Nettles\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image: Getty Images)"

More than a million of these surgeries are performed each year in the US alone and they need to be carried out very precisely and accurately to avoid potentially fatal complications.  Professor Axel Krieger, the mechanical engineer on the team, tells Gareth how this is a major advancement in robotic surgery.\n\nSingapore Surveillance \nSingapore often introduces innovative tech to its citizens, but there is a lack of transparency about the way the data is collected and used. As public tech becomes more affordable it is becoming increasingly available. While the hope is it will solve complex social problems there is no transparency over the algorithms used. This means we don\u2019t know the kind of prejudices, privileges, and assumptions being built in. Without intervention, societal prejudices will continue to be perpetuated. Peter Guest from the Rest of World website has been looking into the dangers of public tech in Singapore and beyond. He tells us why tech companies need to be more transparent.\n\nunReal City\nBackstage at the Brighton Dome looks more like the technical suite of a TV studio than a theatre, as technicians watch multiple screens showing the audience and actors in different rooms - and showing a variety of feeds from their VR headsets - because this piece of immersive theatre, unReal City, takes place in both physical and virtual reality. Reporter Claire Jordan has been meeting with the Director of dreamthinkspeak and disabled artists from Access All Areas \u2013 the two companies behind the production - which explores if it\u2019s easier or better to connect in the flesh or as an avatar and if links are stronger in reality or could the Metaverse allow us to re-invent ourselves.\n\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson.\n\nStudio Manager: Giles Aspen\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\nPhoto: The smart tissue autonomous robot performing laparoscopic anastomosis.

The underwater volcanic eruption severed the country\u2019s only underwater network cable and ash clouds have made satellite connectivity impossible. Professor Nicole Starosielski from NYU, an expert in underwater connectivity and author of \u201cThe undersea network\u201d, joins us on the show. An underwater cable is severed every three days somewhere in the world, yet the network has the capacity to usually cope with this disruption.  Many developing countries do not have this extra capacity as they cannot afford it. Professor Starosielski argues that richer nations should step up and fund this lack of spare connectivity.\n\nVirtual IT brain drain in Argentina\nIT workers in Argentina are being enticed by US and European tech companies to work remotely for them, by offering very attractive salaries and remote working contracts.  Local IT businesses are struggling to retain workers as they leave for salaries in US$ or Euros that can be four times what they are currently earning.  And this is what is different about this type of employment, unlike outsourced IT workers in India or Africa, the employees are not working on local conditions.  As reporter Lucila Pelletieri from Global Press Journal tells Gareth, the loss of local talent will impact not only the country\u2019s IT companies but potentially the economy as well.\n\n\nRobot training made easy\nWe hear about machine learning all the time, but how does a machine actually learn? Say it\u2019s a robot that you need to teach to perform a task in a factory, or even in your home. Well, it\u2019s ok if you happen to be an ace programmer and are happy to dash off a load of computer code. But at the Robot Learning Lab at Imperial College London, they want to make it easier for us to train the machines - as easy as grabbing the robot\u2019s arm and moving it through the task, so that next time, the bot does the movement itself. The Lab presented its latest work at a robot learning conference just before Christmas.

Brewster tells Gareth how they\u2019ve done this \u2013 especially making content that runs on old and absolute technologies accessible today.\n\nThe Future of Text\nWhy is our tech for text so simple and boring \u2013 in effect it\u2019s little more than an electronic copy of a paper page?  But this changes with new technology bringing books and documents to life with interaction and metadata tags that allow you to search, source and organise text as never before.  Father of the internet, Vint Cerf and Frode Hegland, Founder of the Augmented Text Company, are on the show to tell us why we\u2019re now able to move on from using the click of a mouse to manage our text. \n\n\nMoonshot \u2013 tech used to learn more about neglected diseases is fighting COVID\nThe COVID Moonshot project began as a virtual collaboration during UK 2020 lockdown.  Scientists, academics, researchers & students started a twitter-fuelled race against the clock to identify new molecules that could block SARS-CoV-2 and develop treatments that would be globally affordable and easily manufactured for most vulnerable communities. Coordinating this effort is the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, using the AI tools and computer crowdsourcing tech they\u2019ve adopted for neglected diseases as well as the use of the Diamond Light Source technology. All of this tech allows the scientists to build up a huge catalogue of the structures of disease-causing parasites and then model potential treatments to see if they might work. Dr. Nathalie Strub-Wourgaft, Director of Neglected Tropical Diseases, DNDi joins us.\n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson.\n\nStudio Manager: Bill Nettles\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image credit: Internet Archive)",

His research shows that the current unchecked growth of the commercial spyware industry is allowing repressive governments to monitor, harass and attack independent journalists and their sources as part of the battle against the free flow of information. We ask about the tech that is involved and if it\u2019s possible to control it.\n\nEating out with an app\nSo COVID has brought about significant changes in how we order our food \u2013 not only have takeaway apps increased significantly in popularity but food ordering in restaurants in a number of countries was only possible thanks to our smart phones.

                "summary": "The so-called Children\u2019s Code has just come into force in the UK.  The Age-appropriate design code aims to protect children online by making digital services accessed by children comply with standards that safeguard children from being tracked and profiled.  This includes toys, games and edtech but also social media and video sharing platforms.  Changes have already been made by the likes of FB, TikTok and Instagram that will be implemented worldwide.  Professor Sonia Livingstone from the LSE, a specialist in children\u2019s digital rights, is on live.  \n\nThe rise of telemedicine in China\nChina adopted a digital health code earlier this year and has seen a massive increase in the use of tech for healthcare since the start of the COVID pandemic.  Reporter Yuan Ren explains how this rise is taking the pressure off the heavily burdened public healthcare system, despite higher costs to the patient but it\u2019s also driving a demand for online doctors and changing the way the Chinese look after their health.\n\nChina\u2019s online gaming limits\nOur games correspondent Chris Berrow reports on the highly restrictive online gaming clampdown on teenagers announced by the Chinese authorities and how it could bring bigger problems for young people in the future.  \n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington.\n\nStudio Manager: Duncan Hannant\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)"

The information people are tweeting about these disasters can now be collected into a real time map, PetaBencana or Disaster Map, with the help of a twitter bot.

This real time map can help local residents and emergency services know what is happening on the ground. Director Nashin Mahtani told us more.\n\nBitclout\nHarrison Lewis reports on a brand new form of social media. Bitclout is not a company, but a proof of work blockchain designed for running social media. A platform where you can speculate, buy and sell creator coins associated with the social media user, this could be a friend, influencer or high profile celeb like Elon Musk. To do so, you need to hold a token for the website, this is called Bitclout and can be bought with Bitcoin. In itself Bitclout is a native cryptocurrency. Even if you do make money though, you can\u2019t retrieve it.\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari.\n\n(Image: A hand holding a padlock in front of html code to illustrate online data protection\nCredit:  Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\n\nStudio Manager: Nigel Dix\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz",

Lead author Dr Matti Vuorre explains how they analysed data from 430,000 UK and US teenagers and found little or no associations between adolescents\u2019 tech use and mental health problems. But he says the data they were using is limited. Ideally, he wants to use the data that big tech companies hold on our tech use. The findings are published in the journal Clinical Psychological Science.\n\nAfrica Teen Geeks and Africa Tech Week\nFounder and CEO of Africa Teen Geeks, Lindiwe Matlali, discusses her work in technology education and improving access for African children. During the pandemic she set up online schooling for South Africa, reaching over 600,000 children, and is working with Unicef to improve access to coding and robotics education across the continent. She also runs the \u2018Knit2Code\u2019 scheme that teaches women python coding through knitting, empowering mothers and grandmothers to support their daughters\u2019 technology education.\n\nAI colourisation of historical photos\nGwen Katz, a historical novelist and games designer, explains the problems of colourising historical photos. To test the efficacy of colourisation AI she compared the artificial colourisation of black and white photos with their colour originals and found that the bright colours of the original images were lost when colourised by an algorithm. Marta Mrak from BBC R&D discusses how the problem of loss of colours is being solved, by providing the algorithms with reference images, as well as future challenges for designing neural networks to colourise film. \n\nPresenter: Gareth Mitchell \nWith expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington\n\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n(Photo: Two girls wearing face masks looking at their phone.

KPMG is publishing a report, commissioned by the fintech company Finastra, which examines the size of global consumer lending markets and the potential impact of algorithmic bias in money lending decisions.  Amber Sappington, Head of Data & Analytics at Finastra, discusses the potential  problems and why there\u2019s an urgency for the industry to acknowledge the problem and act on it.\n\nProblematic Smartphone Use\n\u2018Smartphone addiction\u2019 has been in the news, following the publication of a new study by the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience Library at King\u2019s in London.  However, \u2018Smartphone addiction\u2019 is not a recognised medical condition.  Gareth speaks with Dr Nicky Kalk, one of the authors of the study, about problematic smartphone use, and if it will be recognised as an illness.  \n\nVirtually Shakespeare\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company, the Philharmonia and Epic Games are amongst 15 organisations who are premiering a new live performance of \u201cDream\u201d (which was inspired by A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream) using motion capture to tell the story of Puck. The aim is to create a shared live experience between a remote audience and a group of physical performers where the live audience can directly influence the world of the actors. Unlike a regular live stream, audiences will play an active role in world-building and the wider storytelling experience, as they would in any gaming environment. Reporter Hannah Fisher has more.\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary by Ghislaine Boddington.\n\nStudio Manager: John Boland\nProducers: Emil Petrie and Ania Lichtarowicz\n\nImage: Young woman uses digital tablet on virtual visual screen at night\nCredit: dowell/Moment/Getty Images"

Also Rabies vaccinations in Malawi \u2013 how tech is eliminating the disease in dogs and Cybersecurity and AI.\n\nAlphabet, Google\u2019s parent company has announced it\u2019s winding down Project Loon.  Hundred\u2019s of high altitude balloons carrying miniature mobile phone towers were to drift around the globe providing internet connectivity to very remote regions.  Digital Planet has been following the project from its first trials in 2013 and even visited one of their base stations in Kenya.  We discuss why it didn\u2019t succeed.\n\nRabies vaccinations in Malawi \u2013 how tech is eliminating the disease in dogs \nVaccinating dogs is the best way of reducing human deaths from rabies, but getting a minimum of 70% of dogs vaccination in an area (the coverage needed to eliminate the disease in the dogs) is very time consuming and costly.  Now a new app, along with detailed data-driven analysis, has led to halving the time it takes to vaccinate dogs as well as significantly reducing costs and the workload for vets. Dr. Stella Mazeri, from Edinburgh University, is on the show explaining how their data-based approach has been so successful in Malawi.\n\nCybersecurity and AI\nIn the second of his reports on cybersecurity threats of the future Florian Bohr looks at artificial intelligence. Apparently, hackers are starting to use machine learning to attack systems more effectively. On the flipside, cybersecurity professionals are depending on AI more and more to control and defend their systems but who will prevail? \n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington. \n\nStudio Manager: Giles Aspen\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n\n\n\n\n(Image: A Google Project Loon internet balloon.

The study suggests that experiences of competence and connecting with others through playing the games may contribute to people\u2019s wellbeing \u2013 however if you already are in a bad mood, playing video games is not going to improve your mood!  Professor Andrew Przybylski, Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, explains the findings.\n\nUnderwater navigation 'solved'\nGPS does not work underwater and powering location devices so they can emit sound with batteries is not practical in wet environments. This means that locating animals and robots underwater is not easy. Now though a team at MIT may have found a solution that uses sound for navigation and by reflecting signals from the underwater environment doesn't need batteries.  Possible applications include marine conservation, climate data gathering and mapping the ocean itself.\n\nBrazilians on lower incomes are embracing digital services \nA new study by the Brazilian Network Information Center shows that Brazilians on lower incomes are turning to digital services - especially fintech - during the COVID19 pandemic.

Not according to Kathleen McGrory, Deputy Investigations Editor at the Tampa Bay Times who has been researching this mysterious tech that the local law enforcement agency has been using. Similar schemes have been scrapped in LA and Chicago but continue in Pasco County.  We asked for an interview with the Pasco County Police Sheriff and one of the engineers behind the tech \u2013 but did not receive a response.\n\nThe rise of the Honjok lifestyle in South Korea\nHonjok is the term used by those Koreans who decide to live, eat, drink, and undergo most activities on their own, and are happy when they are alone with themselves.  This movement started in the first half of the 2010\u2019s and has been growing in parallel with South Korea's rate of smartphone ownership and the emergence of on-demand shopping and social media. It would seem that tech adoption is one of the main factors that helped elevate Honjok into a national movement.  Reporter Silvia Lazzaris has been delving into the online world of Honjok.\n\nCould data unions give you some control and gain from your personal data?\nWould you like to make money from your Google search history?

It\u2019s expected to rise to 45% by 2040. At the end of last year, the Pavagada solar park, in Karnataka, India, became fully operational. Spanning 53 square kilometres, and with a capacity of over 2000 megawatts, this is the largest solar farm in the world.

                "summary": "The number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in Brazil, but access to digital services is getting harder for many of the country\u2019s poorest residents. Emergency aid and state health advice about the virus are only available online, leaving those without internet access with no help at all. Digital Planet\u2019s Angelica Mari explains the situation in Brazil\u2019s favelas and talks about a number of community projects trying to bridge the technology gap.\n\n\nMixed reality in Covid-19 wards\nOver recent months, some hospitals in London have radically reduced the amount of healthcare workers coming into contact with Covid-19. Thanks to mixed reality headsets, only one doctor needs to be at the patient\u2019s bedside while the rest of the medical team sees the same field of view from a different location.  Gareth speaks to Dr. James Kinross and Dr. Guy Martin from Imperial College London about how this tech has helped improve working conditions.\n\n\n3D printing face masks\nShortages of face masks are a common issue around the globe. Could 3D printing be the solution? A firm in Chile has developed an open source design using the natural antimicrobial properties of copper. Meanwhile, a shoe factory in the United States has switched to printing masks for healthcare workers.

Which type is preferable and does there need to be a more coordinated technology across Europe to track COVID-19? Digital Planet reporter Jennifer O\u2019Mahony ask these questions and more on the programme.\n\nOvarian cancer and AI\nIn the final of our reports from the Cambridge Science Festival, Gareth and Bill meet Dr. Mireia Crispin Ortuzar. She researches AI that analyses radiographic images to help choose and track treatment for ovarian cancer. In the long-term, this type of technology could lead to more personalised medicine in response to cancer and, perhaps, in other fields of medicine as well.\n\nRobotic Ventilators\nAt MIT, a team of scientists and engineers have developed a low-cost, open-source robotic hand that can operate manual ventilators. It could help fill the shortage of mechanical ventilators for Covid-19 patients across the globe, particularly in developing countries. Professor Daniela Rus tells Gareth how this new tech works. \n\n\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson.\n\nStudio Manager: Jackie Margerum\n\n(Image: Covid-19 tracing.

It\u2019s just one of about 60 data centres that are putting a huge demand on electricity.  According to a report by the Irish Academy of Engineering 30% more electricity will be needed by 2030 to keep these data centres running. But where will it come from if Ireland is to meet its carbon emission targets?\n\nMore data leaks in India\nA new data privacy bill has been passed in India, but with hundreds of millions of individuals having their data leaked last year alone, will this new bill ensure data privacy? BBC data journalist Shadab Nazmi has exposed a number of information security blunders in India and explains what has been happening.\n\nAcoustic camera\nImagine that you could only hear specific sounds in certain parts of a room. So an intensive care nurse would only hear the beeps from the medical bay of their patient? This might be possible as scientists at the University of Sussex in England are splitting sounds, focusing them into beams and even bending them.  Our reporter Hannah Fisher has been there to explore.\n\n(Photo: Large swarms of desert locusts threatens Kenya\"s food security.

Dr Cynthia Rudin explains why bird identification was the perfect model to test the computers\u2019 abilities \u2013 and check them. \n\n\n\n\n(Image: Facial recognition with smartphone.

He explains how optical and thermal satellite images are delivering real time data about the Amazon rainforest fires.  This means he and his team can calculate not only what is one fire but how much biodiversity has been lost and carbon released into the atmosphere. They are also analysing date from the ISS and the NASA GEDI mission and are able to recreate 3D images of the surface of the Earth before and after the fires.\n\nThe Rwandan tech scene\nGareth Mitchell visits a tech start-up hub in Kigali.  He meets developers from Awesomity Lab who are currently creating e-government websites as well as apps and websites for major international companies.
