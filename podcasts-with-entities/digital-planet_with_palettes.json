Now scientists and engineers in the UK have used motion sensors to capture the way patients move.  They processed this data through new AI medical technology that they say can predict disease progression and significantly increase the efficiency of clinical trials in these conditions.  Treatments are desperately needed as both diseases can lead to paralysis and currently there are often not enough patients for clinical trials.

Shopee have now stopped customers from linking their accounts to the platform directly.  The company also denies they were hacked and that they had taken the decision to stop bank transfers last month.  It also says that the customers were probably victims of phishing scams.

Twenty thousand cameras, half of which had facial recognition capabilities, were to be erected across the city \u2013 making it one of the largest facial recognition rollouts in the world.  Much opposition from civil liberty groups \u2013 who claim that the system would allow the city authorities to track people\u2019s activities on social media with the data they gathered through the cameras \u2013 has forced this announcement.  However, many people fear this may just be a postponement.  Angelica Mari explains more.</p><p>3D printed violins\nImagine printing a violin in library for just $7US?  That\u2019s what Dr. Mary-Elizabeth Brown, the Director of Montreal-based AVIVA Young Artists Program, has managed to do.

In experiments, currently carried out in mice at the University of California San Diego, the tiny robots swam around the lungs and delivered antibiotics that killed the disease-causing bacteria.  The amount of antibiotics needed is a tiny fraction of the amount currently used to treat this infection intravenously.  The robots are made from algae cells (this allows them to move) covered in antibiotic-filled nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are made with tiny spheres that are coated with the cell membranes of neutrophils \u2013 a type of white blood cell that fights infection and inflammation -  making the microrobots more effective at fighting the lung infection.  We hear from lead author Professor Joseph Wang about the tech that\u2019s allowed the team of nanoengineers to create these microrobots.</p><p>Internet shutdowns in India \u2013 on what grounds are they allowed?\nSince 2012 there have been 683 full internet blackouts in India according to the internet shutdown tracker run by the Software Freedom Law Centre (SLFC).  Many of these are done without following government rules.  Now India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has only a week left to reveal the grounds on which it approves or imposes internet shutdowns in the country.  The SFLC filed a lawsuit against the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and West Bengal, after internet shutdowns were ordered to prevent cheating during state exams. This is a common occurrence around the time of public exams across the country as stolen exam papers often appear on the internet.  Now the Supreme Court has ruled that the protocols on which these decisions are made need to be made public.  Tech reporter Emma Woollacott explains the massive impact of these shutdowns and lawyer Mishi Choudhary founder of the SFLC explains why they bought about the lawsuit.</p><p>National Robotarium opens in Edinburgh\nDigital Planet\u2019s Hannah Fisher has been given access to the UK\u2019s first robotarium and reports on the eve of its opening for the programme.

            "contentSnippet": "Microrobots have been created and used to treat the most common form of pneumonia that infects patients in ICU. In experiments, currently carried out in mice at the University of California San Diego, the tiny robots swam around the lungs and delivered antibiotics that killed the disease-causing bacteria.  The amount of antibiotics needed is a tiny fraction of the amount currently used to treat this infection intravenously.  The robots are made from algae cells (this allows them to move) covered in antibiotic-filled nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are made with tiny spheres that are coated with the cell membranes of neutrophils \u2013 a type of white blood cell that fights infection and inflammation -  making the microrobots more effective at fighting the lung infection.  We hear from lead author Professor Joseph Wang about the tech that\u2019s allowed the team of nanoengineers to create these microrobots.\nInternet shutdowns in India \u2013 on what grounds are they allowed?\nSince 2012 there have been 683 full internet blackouts in India according to the internet shutdown tracker run by the Software Freedom Law Centre (SLFC).  Many of these are done without following government rules.  Now India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has only a week left to reveal the grounds on which it approves or imposes internet shutdowns in the country.  The SFLC filed a lawsuit against the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and West Bengal, after internet shutdowns were ordered to prevent cheating during state exams. This is a common occurrence around the time of public exams across the country as stolen exam papers often appear on the internet.  Now the Supreme Court has ruled that the protocols on which these decisions are made need to be made public.  Tech reporter Emma Woollacott explains the massive impact of these shutdowns and lawyer Mishi Choudhary founder of the SFLC explains why they bought about the lawsuit.\nNational Robotarium opens in Edinburgh\nDigital Planet\u2019s Hannah Fisher has been given access to the UK\u2019s first robotarium and reports on the eve of its opening for the programme.

VPN companies in India have sharply criticised the ruling, and some have already exited and pulled their servers out of the country.

While the rules of football may not have changed much in recent years, there is one thing that has: the amount of data. Coaches and teams can now examine player performance and statistics in great detail. Has this transformed the way the game is played? Gareth chats to Ruben Saavedra, CEO of Metrica Sports, which uses software to analyse videos of football games, and we hear from John Muller, a sports journalist at The Athletic, and Jordi Mompart, Director of Research and Analytics at FC Barcelona. </p><p>The tech behind the ABBAtars\nABBA's show opened this week in London, using digitally created avatars of their younger selves.

New research shows that binaural beats -  illusionary tones created by the brain when the brain hears two different tones in each ear \u2013 can change someone\u2019s emotional state.  The work, published in Drug and Alcohol Review, shows for the first time that people use binaural beats to relax, fall asleep and even to try to get a psychedelic drug high.  BBC\u2019s R&amp;D Audio team have created a binaural beat soundscape especially for Digital Planet and we speak to Dr Alexia Maddox, a tech sociologist, one of the researchers behind the study.</p><p>Publishing via What\u2019s App \u2013 getting female authors recognised in Zimbabwe \nGetting a book deal may seem like an impossible dream for many budding authors, but in Zimbabwe, for many female writers, this is a reality. Linda Mujuru, a senior reporter for Global Press Journal, tells us how most publishers are struggling in Zimbabwe due to the dire economic situation over the last twenty years and why so many authors have turned to social media as their only way of telling their stories.  Samantha Rumbidzai Vazhure set up her own publishing house in the UK as she could not get her work printed. She reads one of her poems in Shona, a native Zimbabwean language,  and explains how she now looks for fellow female authors online and publishes their work too.</p><p>The programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari.</p><p>Studio Manager: Giles Aspen\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz</p><p>(Image: Music in the mind concept.

Reporter Claire Jordan has been meeting with the Director of dreamthinkspeak and disabled artists from Access All Areas \u2013 the two companies behind the production - which explores if it\u2019s easier or better to connect in the flesh or as an avatar and if links are stronger in reality or could the Metaverse allow us to re-invent ourselves.</p><p>The programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson.</p><p>Studio Manager: Giles Aspen\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz</p><p>Photo: The smart tissue autonomous robot performing laparoscopic anastomosis.

                "summary": "<p>Twenty-five years ago the world wide web was 2.5 terabytes and you needed to dial-up via your phone line to get onto it, so Brewster Kahle decided to set up a project to archive what was out there already.  Now the Internet Archive consists of more than 588 billion web pages, as well as 28 million books and texts, 14 million audio items, and 580,000 software titles, making it one of the world\u2019s largest digital libraries.  Brewster tells Gareth how they\u2019ve done this \u2013 especially making content that runs on old and absolute technologies accessible today.</p><p>The Future of Text\nWhy is our tech for text so simple and boring \u2013 in effect it\u2019s little more than an electronic copy of a paper page?  But this changes with new technology bringing books and documents to life with interaction and metadata tags that allow you to search, source and organise text as never before.  Father of the internet, Vint Cerf and Frode Hegland, Founder of the Augmented Text Company, are on the show to tell us why we\u2019re now able to move on from using the click of a mouse to manage our text. </p><p>Moonshot \u2013 tech used to learn more about neglected diseases is fighting COVID\nThe COVID Moonshot project began as a virtual collaboration during UK 2020 lockdown.  Scientists, academics, researchers &amp; students started a twitter-fuelled race against the clock to identify new molecules that could block SARS-CoV-2 and develop treatments that would be globally affordable and easily manufactured for most vulnerable communities. Coordinating this effort is the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, using the AI tools and computer crowdsourcing tech they\u2019ve adopted for neglected diseases as well as the use of the Diamond Light Source technology. All of this tech allows the scientists to build up a huge catalogue of the structures of disease-causing parasites and then model potential treatments to see if they might work. Dr. Nathalie Strub-Wourgaft, Director of Neglected Tropical Diseases, DNDi joins us.</p><p>The programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson.</p><p>Studio Manager: Bill Nettles\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz</p><p>(Image credit: Internet Archive)</p>"

It\u2019s proving incredibly popular and is allowing the 40 million unbanked people in the country access to electronic payments.  Unfortunately its popularity has also led to significant issues \u2013 namely ransom demands by kidnappers that can be paid immediately. By lowering the payment limit and stopping night payments, it\u2019s hoped this will curb the problem. Silvia Bassi, who runs the tech website The Shift in Brazil, is on the show.</p><p>Bitcoin mining in Navajo Nation \u2013 crypto-colonialism\nIn the past traditional mining often took advantage of local people living near the mine, now something similar may be happening with cryptocurrencies. A bitcoin mine in the Four Corners region of New Mexico which belongs to the Navajo nation is causing controversy. It consumes enough to power 19,600 homes, yet many local residents lack water and electricity. The scheme was originally set up with the Navajo\u2019s support but there is opposition from some local people. Mining companies argue though that investing in their schemes will ultimately reap financial rewards for the local people. Reporter Luke Ottenhof is on the show to discuss this story and the rise of crypto-colonialism globally.</p><p>AI training for top flight football\nOur gaming correspondent Chris Berrow reports on the latest tech to train footballers. Norwich City are the first UK Premiership club to use the Soccerbot360 simulator which claims to replicate real-life match scenarios - enabling players to work on their decision-making. We will soon see if it improves the Canaries\u2019 game.</p><p>The programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari.</p><p>Studio Manager: Bob Nettles\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz</p><p>(Image: Pix logo on smartphone with Brazilian currency\nCredit: Cris Faga/NurPhoto via Getty Images)</p>"

Composer Kieran Brunt is back to tell us about his latest creation. This new work explores how the internet has dramatically reshaped our lives over the past 30 years. Woven around personal stories Kieran Brunt features electronic and vocal elements that explore the impact the internet has had on all our lives.  The full Virtual Symphony can be heard on BBC Radio 3 on Sunday 18th July 2021.\nThe programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington\nStudio Manager: \nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz\n(Image: Getty Images)",

They have just been awarded almost $5m for the project. Remy the community lead at Common Voice Kinyarwanda and Chenai chair special adviser for Africa Innovation at the Mozilla Foundation tells us more about the work.</p><p>Federated Learning\nAs more of our data is processed through machine learning systems, Dr Nic Lane, of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory, explains a new way of processing and using our data without the need to send it through data centres. One solution to reduce the impact is federated learning \u2013 where data is processed on the edge, on your device, rather than being centralised. Not only does this reduce the environmental impact of computing, but it also has benefits for privacy and opens up opportunities for data sharing between companies.</p><p>Electronic VR socks\nReporter Claire Jordan has been investigating a novel approach to \u201cwalking\u201d in a virtual reality. Existing ways are expensive and need considerable space to function, as well as having a less than satisfactory user experience. A new technology being developed by Professor Yusuke Matsuda of Toyohashi University of Technology in Japan could expand the reach of immersive VR movement to a much wider audience and deliver a better user experience than current solutions. The user wears electronic socks that create the feeling of walking in VR even though the user is sitting down. This could allow users to spend much longer in VR and also allow people with mobility issues to move around more freely, and possibly feel as though they are moving, in VR.                                    </p><p>The programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson. \nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz</p><p>(Image: Mozilla\u2019s Common Voice project.

Marta Mrak from BBC R&amp;D discusses how the problem of loss of colours is being solved, by providing the algorithms with reference images, as well as future challenges for designing neural networks to colourise film. </p><p>Presenter: Gareth Mitchell \nWith expert commentary from Ghislaine Boddington</p><p>Producer: Ania Lichtarowicz</p><p>(Photo: Two girls wearing face masks looking at their phone.

The novels will also undergo computer analysis that will look at sentence length, vocabulary and grammar difficulty to see if an algorithm can identify a best seller.</p><p>(Image: Getty Images)                                         </p><p>The programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson. </p><p>Studio Manager: Nigel Dix\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz</p>"

These are often taken some time after the crime has happened \u2013 but what if it was possible to take a witness statement very quickly using AI chatbots?  Dr Julia Shaw is on the programme discussing her latest research into using an AI chatbot in reporting harassment in the workplace.  Not only are statements taken more quickly, they are done better by a machine than a person, as people can interrupt, misinterpret, judge or incorrectly record statements.  The AI chatbot sticks to a script and allows the witness to do the same.</p><p>Machine learning to understand Tinnitus\nAI is helping to advance research into tinnitus, a condition often described as a ringing, buzzing or hissing in the ears, which affects up to 1 in 5 adults. Clinicians currently have no objective means of diagnosing tinnitus and must rely on the accounts of people living with the condition. But machine learning algorithms, combined with brain imaging techniques, are allowing scientists to develop a clinical tool to measure tinnitus objectively.

Use a GPS grazing collar.  This technology has been developed by Norwegian firm NoFence and uses GPS to track individual animals and stop them crossing boundaries that have been progammed using a mapping app on a smart phone. The collars emit a bleeping noise that gets louder as animals reach a virtual fence and will receive a small electric shock if they cross it (this is much smaller than one from an electric fence).  Electric fences are expensive and difficult to fit in remote terrains and these GPS collars allow farmers to regularly change their grazing sites.  We hear about the tech from UK manager of NoFence Synne Foss Budal and about the conservation benefits from Emma Wright from North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty who is trailing the collars in their upland pastures. </p><p>Ubiquitous Connectivity and cybersecurity\nLate last year the World Economic Forum and the University of Oxford, released a report on the future of cybersecurity. They identified four emerging technology trends that could endanger security in the digital world within the next 5 to 10 years. In a series of reports Digital Planet\u2019s Florian Bohr looks into each of these cybersecurity threats of the future. This week, we hear about how the sheer amount of digital connections between devices, services, and people is an inherent cybersecurity risk. </p><p>(Image: Getty Images)                                   </p><p>The programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Angelica Mari</p><p>Studio Manager: John Boland\nProducer: Ania Lichtarowicz</p>",

The main author of the report, Dr. Samantha Bradshaw is on the show.\nGPS Grazing Collars \nHow do you control where your animals graze if you can\u2019t fit a fence to keep them contained to a certain area? Use a GPS grazing collar.  This technology has been developed by Norwegian firm NoFence and uses GPS to track individual animals and stop them crossing boundaries that have been progammed using a mapping app on a smart phone. The collars emit a bleeping noise that gets louder as animals reach a virtual fence and will receive a small electric shock if they cross it (this is much smaller than one from an electric fence).  Electric fences are expensive and difficult to fit in remote terrains and these GPS collars allow farmers to regularly change their grazing sites.  We hear about the tech from UK manager of NoFence Synne Foss Budal and about the conservation benefits from Emma Wright from North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty who is trailing the collars in their upland pastures. \nUbiquitous Connectivity and cybersecurity\nLate last year the World Economic Forum and the University of Oxford, released a report on the future of cybersecurity. They identified four emerging technology trends that could endanger security in the digital world within the next 5 to 10 years. In a series of reports Digital Planet\u2019s Florian Bohr looks into each of these cybersecurity threats of the future.

There are many smaller companies that have so far not declared their intentions and others are clearly breaking the few regulations in place by using people\u2019s images without consent. It\u2019s widely known that facial recognition technology is racially and sexually biased, and there is little, if any, evidence that this tech does help to reduce crime levels.

                "summary": "<p>Hacking internet-enabled cars\nAbout 40% of cars in the US are connected to the internet. While this enables many useful functions, it also makes them vulnerable to hacks. As all the electronics systems within the car are connected, hackers could take full control of the vehicle. Skanda Vivek tells Gareth how this is possible, and what would happen if a large number of cars were hacked at the same time.</p><p>Covid-19 treatment trials in AI\nIt is possible to do drug trials in vitro and in vivo \u2013 but what about simulating them? The Cambridge-based company AI VIVO uses machine learning and AI to model diseased cells and their potential treatments. For Covid-19, they screened 90,000 different compounds to find out which drugs could be effective against the virus. Could this be a new way to discover drug treatments? Gareth speaks to David Cleevely to find out how it works.</p><p>Mobile phone rain forecast for farmers\nFarmers with small holdings in developing countries often do not benefit from new technologies, but a tech project in Pakistan has managed to help drastically reduce their water consumption. Farmers receive text messages about when it is going to rain and whether they should irrigate their crops, generating an average of 40% in water savings. Roland Pease has been finding out more. </p><p>The programme is presented by Gareth Mitchell with expert commentary from Bill Thompson.</p><p>(Image: Traffic jam on multilane road.

That was a step too far for Swedish regulators, who recently fined a high school $20, 000 for doing just that.  Despite a few token control measures there seems to be very little regulation in this field. The UK Biometrics Commissioner Professor Paul Wiles explains his concerns.</p><p>Privatisation of national assets \u2013 what happens to your data?\nIn Brazil, President Bolsonaro is in the midst of a $300bn dollar privatisation drive including selling off the post and tax offices.

Evronia Azer knows all about the double-edged sword when it comes to technology in the midst of conflict. On one side there are tools to mobilise protest, on the other are tools of state control and surveillance. She is Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Business and Law at Coventry University in the UK where her research interests include data privacy and governance.  She joins us on the programme</p><p>Map Kibera\nTen years ago Digital Planet reported on the Map Kibera project, which was just an idea to provide information to OpenStreetMap about the Nairobi slum. This quickly turned into the Map Kibera Organisation which makes sure that Kibera is connected and is focussed on improving people\u2019s lives in the slum.  Digital Planet has been back to Kibera to see how the project has changed.</p><p>First ever plant selfie\nHannah Fisher reports on a plant called Pete which could revolutionise field conservation by powering a camera to take selfies as he grows.  London Zoo scientists have laid the groundwork for the world\u2019s first plant selfie \u2013 a pioneering scientific trial in the Zoo\u2019s Rainforest Life exhibit which will try out how microbial fuel cells power a plant to take its own picture.  This they hope will lead to using plants to power camera traps and sensors in the wild allowing conservationists to monitor habitats remotely.</p><p>(Protesters in Hong Kong are seen wearing helmets and gas mask while looking at their phone.
