Think of these episodes as the audio liner notes.\nThis week,\u00a0More Perfect\u00a0takes a look at three amendments on the\u00a0more obscure\u00a0end of\u00a0the spectrum. The 12th, 17th, and 20th Amendments made\u00a0fine-tune adjustments\u00a0to the way we pick our leaders. More Perfect\u00a0is here to prove these\u00a0three are more interesting than you think they are.\nFor starters, the 12th Amendment is the secret star of the hit musical\u00a0Hamilton.\u00a0The Election of 1800 and the kerfuffle between Aaron Burr and Thomas Jefferson was one of the reasons we passed the 12th\u00a0Amendment, which made it so that\u00a0presidential and vice presidential candidates run alongside each other on a single ticket. It was meant to avoid awkward situations where political opponents suddenly had to be partners in government. But\u00a0Radiolab's\u00a0Rachael Cusick reflects on the Clinton-Trump race and the ways the 12th Amendment may have polarized politics.\u00a0Then, listen to Octopus Project's original song\u00a0about the 12th Amendment.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe idea for the 20th Amendment, which shortened the \"lame duck\" period for outgoing presidents and members of Congress,\u00a0was\u00a0first proposed around the same time as the 12th, but it took years to get political momentum to pass it. That momentum came in part from infamous president, Warren G. Harding, whose missteps ignited a movement to pass it.\u00a0Huey Supreme wrote an original song about the 20th Amendment from the perspective of a lame duck.\nThen, More Perfect\u00a0skips back to the 17th\u00a0Amendment, which made the election of U.S. senators more democratic.\u00a0Our state legislatures used to hand-pick Senators, but the 17th\u00a0made it so the people elect their Senators directly.\u00a0More Perfect reflects on whether direct democracy is all it's cracked up to be. Listen to original songs about the 17th amendment by Stef Chura and Donny Dinero (of Mail the Horse).",

Does it mean we should lower the voting age even further?</p>\n<p>When you're done with the episode, check out songs by\u00a0Devendra Banhart and Suburban Living inspired by Amendments 25 and 26 on <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\">27: The Most Perfect Album</a>.</p>\n<p>And watch Devendra Banhart's incredible music video here!</p>\n<p> \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Video illustration by <a href=\"https://justinbuschardt.com/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Buschardt</a>.Video animation by <a href=\"https://mightycoconut.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Mighty Coconut</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to The White House Historical Association.\u00a0</em></p>"

They addressed slavery, citizenship, equality and voting rights for\u00a0black people. This week, the\u00a0<em>More Perfect\u00a0</em>team explores the\u00a0legacy of the amendments beyond the Civil War \u2014 the ways the\u00a0promises of these amendments changed the country and the ways they've fallen short.</p>\r\n<p>First, <em>More Perfect\u00a0</em>Executive Producer Suzie Lechtenberg and Legal Editor Elie Mystal explore the loophole in the 13th Amendment's slavery ban that's being used in a strange context: college football. We\u00a0share songs about the 13th Amendment from <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/#amendment-13\">Kash Doll and Bette Smith</a>. Then, producer Julia Longoria shares a conversation with her roommate Alia Almeida\u00a0exploring their relationship to the amendments.</p>\r\n<p><span>Inspired by the 14th's Amendment's grant of equal protection and citizenship rights,\u00a0<a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/#amendment-14\">Sarah Kay's poem</a> tells the story of\u00a0her grandmother, a U.S. citizen who was interned during World War II in a Japanese American Internment camp.\u00a0Despite the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause, the Supreme Court upheld the internment of U.S. citizens based solely on their Japanese heritage in a case called\u00a0</span><em><a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/american-pendulum-fred/\" target=\"_blank\">Korematsu v. United States</a></em><span>. In 2018, the\u00a0Supreme Court said\u00a0</span><em>Korematsu</em><span>\u00a0was\u00a0\"wrong the day it was decided.\" The Court went on to uphold President Trump's controversial travel ban in\u00a0</span><em>Trump v.

Think of these episodes as the audio liner notes.</em>Episode Four begins, as all episodes should: with Dolly Parton. Parton\u00a0<a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a song for us</a> (!) about the 19th Amendment and women (finally) getting the right to vote.Also in this episode: Our siblings at <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/one-vote\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radiolab</em></a> share a story with us that they did about how the 19th Amendment almost died on a hot summer night in Tennessee. The 19th Amendment was obviously a <em>huge</em> milestone for women in the United States. But it was pretty well-understood that this wasn\u2019t a victory for all women; it was a victory for white women. People of color have faced all sorts of barriers to voting throughout our nation's history. This includes\u00a0poll taxes, which were fees people had to pay in order to vote. The 24th Amendment eliminated federal\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/23/anti-poll-tax-amendment-is-50-years-old-today/\" target=\"_blank\">poll taxes</a>\u00a0in 1964. We hear <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\" target=\"_blank\">a song inspired by the 24th Amendment</a>, created for us by <a href=\"https://carolineshaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Caroline Shaw</a>. Kevin Morby\u00a0made an excellent song for us about the 24th, too. Check it out <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, Simon Tam, from the band <a href=\"http://www.theslants.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Slants</a> tells the story of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2016/15-1293\" target=\"_blank\">Supreme Court case</a> about their name, and talks about\u00a0<a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\" target=\"_blank\">the song they wrote</a> about the 18th and 21st Amendments for our album.

We're taking on these 27 amendments both in song and in story.\u00a0This episode is best listened to alongside <a href=\"http://mostperfectalbum.org\">27: The Most Perfect Album</a>,\u00a0an entire album (an ALBUM!) and digital experience\u00a0of original music and art inspired by the 27 Amendments. Think of these episodes as the\u00a0audio liner notes.</em></p>\n<p>Let's get started.\u00a0If we're talking about the Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, it only feels right to start at the beginning. The First and Second Amendments are arguably the most ferociously contentious amendments of them all, and the Third Amendment is the underdog that everyone underestimates but (maybe) shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, Episode One dives into the poetic dream behind the First Amendment. This is the amendment that reflects the kind of country the Founding Fathers hoped we would be. Next, we examine the fiercely debated words of the Second Amendment, words that often feel like they divide our nation in two. And finally, we question whether the seemingly irrelevant Third Amendment might actually be the key to figuring out where our country is going.</p>\n<p>And when you're done\u00a0with the episode, take a\u00a0<a href=\"http://mostperfectalbum.org\">listen</a>\u00a0to the songs by Joey Stylez, Cherry Glazerr, Sateen, Flor de Toloache, Michael Richard Klics, Palehound, and They Might be Giants inspired by Amendments 1, 2 and 3 on<em>\u00a0<a href=\"http://mostperfectalbum.org\">27: The Most Perfect Album.</a></em></p>"

But for nearly a century after that, women had a hard time convincing the courts that they should be allowed to be jurors, lawyers, and bartenders, just the same as men. A then-lawyer at the ACLU named Ruth Bader Ginsburg set out to convince an all-male Supreme Court to take sex discrimination seriously with an unconventional strategy. She didn\u2019t just bring cases where women were the victims of discrimination; she also brought cases where men were the victims.

In the 18th century, two feuding Frenchmen inspired a one-sentence law that helped launch American human rights litigation into the 20th century. The Alien Tort Statute allowed a Paraguayan woman to find justice for a terrible crime committed in her homeland. But as America reached further and further out into the world, the court was forced to confront the contradictions in our country\u2019s ideology: sympathy vs. sovereignty. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court heard arguments in <em>Jesner v. Arab Bank</em>, a case that could reshape the way America responds to human rights abuses abroad.

Baby Girl<em>\u00a0</em>was\u00a0a legal battle that entangled a biological father, a heart-broken couple, and the tragic history of Native American children taken from their families.</p>\r\n<div class=\"article-description\">\r\n<p>When producer\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/people/tim-howard/\">Tim Howard</a>\u00a0first read about this case, it struck him as a sad, but seemingly straightforward custody dispute. But as he started talking to lawyers, historians, and the families involved in the case, it became clear that it was much more than that. Because\u00a0Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl<em>\u00a0</em>challenges parts of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, this case puts one little girl at the center of a storm of legal intricacies, Native American tribal culture, and heart-wrenching personal stakes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A note from Jad:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\"As you guys may know, our new\u00a0podcast\u00a0<em>More Perfect</em>\u00a0is <em>Radiolab</em>\u2019s first ever spin-off show. But I want to share something special with you: THE <em>Radiolab</em> episode that inspired us to launch this whole series about the Supreme Court. After we put out this episode we got hooked on the court and the kinds of stories we could tell about it.

Baby Girl\u00a0was\u00a0a legal battle that entangled a biological father, a heart-broken couple, and the tragic history of Native American children taken from their families.\n\r\n\r\nWhen producer\u00a0Tim Howard\u00a0first read about this case, it struck him as a sad, but seemingly straightforward custody dispute. But as he started talking to lawyers, historians, and the families involved in the case, it became clear that it was much more than that. Because\u00a0Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl\u00a0challenges parts of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, this case puts one little girl at the center of a storm of legal intricacies, Native American tribal culture, and heart-wrenching personal stakes.\n\r\nA note from Jad:\n\r\n\"As you guys may know, our new\u00a0podcast\u00a0More Perfect\u00a0is Radiolab\u2019s first ever spin-off show. But I want to share something special with you: THE Radiolab episode that inspired us to launch this whole series about the Supreme Court.
