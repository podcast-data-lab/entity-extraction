It happens when there is close interaction between wild animals and human beings, which leads to injury, death, predation and transmission of diseases. In February 2019, Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) issued a notice to the public that the dry spell being experienced in most parts of the country was displacing wildlife from their traditional habitats in search of pasture and water. This had increased conflict as the wildlife came into contact with the public and human activities. They said that as the dry spell progressed, the risk of human wildlife conflict was expected to increase until the country received the long rains. Areas that have experienced increased incidence of human wildlife conflict were in Narok, Taita Taveta, Laikipia, Kajiado, Meru, Mau, Marsabit, Lamu and the Mt. Kenya region.

            "contentSnippet": "On July 14th 2019, NTV aired a feature titled Red Alert, which revealed that Kenyan supermarkets and retail outlets were using sodium metabisulfite to increase the shelf life of meat products by making them look fresher for longer, so as to prevent losses. They were also found to repackage these products and change the dates so as to dupe their customers into buying these products past their sell-by date. The conversation that arose after was intense, pointing out that supermarkets were using excess quantities of the compound, without disclosing it to consumers, which was exacerbated by changing the dates on products to deceive customers.\n This is not the first time we have had widespread panic and anxiety over food in Kenya. We have had reports of sukuma wiki and spinach being grown next to sewers and being toxic and containing heavy metals, water containing microplastics, chicken being fattened using antibiotics, formalin being used to preserve meat, maize with aflatoxin, sugar containing mercury, and fruits being ripened using calcium carbide. This is in addition to pesticide use in farm products that elicits the same concerns. We\u2019re joined by Wanjiru Kamau, an agricultural and environmental policy expert, to discuss food safety in general in Kenya.\n Resources\n  The Kenya Food Control System\n  The Kenya Food and Drugs Authority Bill (2019)\n  Kenya National Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (2015 - 2020)\n Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS)\n Pest Control Products Board (PCPB)\n  Dietary risk factors for non-communicable diseases in Kenya: findings of the STEPS survey, 2015\n  Food safety and quality management in Kenya: An overview of the roles played by various stakeholders\n  Food Safety in Kenya: Focus on fruits and vegetables\n  SBS Senior Lecturer Publishes Case Study on Food Safety Concerns in Kenya\n  Why food safety is a major national issue\n  Lifestyle Diseases: An Increasing Cause Of Health Loss\n Heavy Metal Concentration in Vegetables Grown around Dumpsites in Nairobi City County, Kenya\n  Coca-Cola admits presence of plastic in Dasani\n  Antibiotics in meat: why Kenya needs to do\u00a0more\n  Keep birds free from antibiotics, use supplements\n Kenya's 'contaminated sugar' row: What we know\n  Report reveals seized sugar contains Mercury\n  Tests show dangerous levels of toxins in foods sold in Nairobi\n  Could your fruit vendor be selling you poison?\n \u00a0\n  Experts poke holes in proposed food and drugs law\n  How safe is your food?

That would mean that in 2018/19, we can reasonably expect to lose KES 1 trillion, if not more, to corruption. Much of this money ends up in offshore accounts in countries that are tax havens. As at 2007, economists at the American research firm National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) estimated that about 70% of Kenya\u2019s GDP (KES 1.83 trillion in 2007) was stashed abroad, while the think-tank Global Financial Integrity (GFI) estimated in an October 2018 report that Kenya loses about 8% of government revenues annually (above USD 907 million, or KES 78.41 billion, based on the historical exchange rate) to trade misinvoicing by multinationals.</p> <p>We\u2019re joined by <a href= \"https://twitter.com/WillFitzgibbon\">Will Fitzgibbon</a>, an investigative journalist at the <a href= \"https://www.icij.org/\">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)</a>, who has worked on the Panama Papers, Paradise Papers and Swiss Leaks, to talk about where our stolen money goes.
