He is the author of Pilgrim Bell, Calling a Wolf a Wolf, and the chapbook, Portrait of the Alcoholic. His poems appear in The New Yorker, The New York Times, Paris Review, Best American Poetry, and elsewhere.

The poem closes with an observation of a moment of sexual tension between her mother and another man. Kathleen\u2019s right there, but feels like she\u2019s barely noticed. Everyone goes to bed alone, and we are left with the poet and her awareness of what lay underneath the surface.\nKathleen Flenniken is the author of three poetry collections, most recently Post Romantic, selected by Linda Bierds for the Pacific Northwest Poetry Series and published by University of Washington Press in Fall 2020. Kathleen\u2019s awards include a Pushcart Prize and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and Artist Trust.

There\u2019s a war going on, but it doesn\u2019t affect the person speaking, so they don\u2019t get involved. Instead they stayed outside and caught the sun. They lived happily during the war, and are now saying (forgive us). This poem leaves us wondering what it would mean to make such a confession, to ask for forgiveness, and whether it\u2019d do any good.</p><p><strong>Ilya Kaminsky</strong> was born in Odessa, former Soviet Union in 1977, and arrived in the United States in 1993, when his family was granted asylum by the American government.

                "summary": "This poem offers critique into a moment of Irish history when Ireland, through independence, was rising to the light. But Irish women were facing lives as constricted in independence as under empire.
