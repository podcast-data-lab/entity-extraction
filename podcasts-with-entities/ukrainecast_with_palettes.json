                "summary": "<p>Russia has opened a murder investigation after a journalist, Darya Dugina, died in a suspected car bombing not far from Moscow. Was she the target? Or was it her father, the ultra-nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin?</p><p>Victoria, Vitaly and Gabriel Gatehouse, who interviewed Alexander after the annexation of Crimea, profile the man said to be one of Putin\u2019s inspirations.</p><p>They also talk about who might be behind the murder and what consequences there might be in Ukraine, where Independence Day celebrations planned for Wednesday have already been curtailed.\n\u00a0\nAnd we hear from Brian Ennis, the father of Adam Ennis. Adam is a mechanic from Scotland. But, without first telling his parents, he\u2019s now fighting on the frontline in Ukraine.\n\u00a0\nThis episode of Ukrainecast was made by Daniel Wittenberg with Ivana Davidovic, Arsenii Sokolov and Louise Hidalgo. The technical producer was Emma Crowe. The editor is Jonathan Aspinwall. With thanks to Sky Sports.\n\u00a0\nEmail Ukrainecast@bbc.co.uk with your questions and comments.

There she heard accounts of violence against civilians, of shootings and summary executions - including the killing of a young woman in a red coat.

A food shopping list was found in her coat pocket.</p><p>UNICEF\u2019s James Elder explains how over one hundred days of war have \u2018wrought devastating consequences for children at a scale not seen since World War II\u2019. The agency says 70% of Ukrainian children are displaced by fighting. </p><p>And, Mykola Bielieskov, from the National Institute for Strategic Studies in Kyiv, explains why he believes the long-range rocket artillery promised by the US and the UK won\u2019t be enough to stabilise the front line, even less to push the Russian troops back. </p><p>This episode of Ukrainecast was made by Estelle Doyle with Osman Iqbal and Alix Pickles.
