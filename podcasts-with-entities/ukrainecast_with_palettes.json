The BBC\u2019s James Waterhouse has been in Bakhmut, the city that both countries regard as totemic in the conflict. Called the \u2018meat grinder\u2019 by the head of the Wagner Group, James found a city almost uninhabitable.\n\nBut with new weapons on the way from the West, could Ukraine\u2019s forces be about to move from defensive to offensive mode? Frank Gardner tells us they could be a game-changer.\n\nAnd Alina Revcko, an English teacher who works with the British Council in a village near Kyiv, tells us about the struggle to keep teaching amidst the chaos and disruption of the war. \n\nToday\u2019s episode is presented by Victoria Derbyshire and Vitaliy Shevchenko.\n \nThe producers were Clare Williamson and Luke Radcliff. The technical producer was Mike Regaard. The series producer is Fiona Leach. The assistant editor is Alison Gee and the editor is Sam Bonham.\n \nEmail Ukrainecast@bbc.co.uk with your questions and comments.

                "summary": "On the day when most of the world\u2019s leaders and officials are gathering in London for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, President Putin is notable by his absence. He is one of only six heads of state who was not invited. \n\nAlso, at a summit in Uzbekistan, Putin faced concerns by the Chinese President Xi Jinping and further admonishment by India\u2019s Narendra Modi. Vitaly and the BBC\u2019s former Russia correspondent Bridget Kendall unpick what this all means for the Russian President.\n\nAnd they discuss what is happening within Russia where more people are also speaking out against the war, including one of the country\u2019s biggest pop stars from the Soviet era, Alla Pugacheva. \n\nFinally, one of Ukraine\u2019s most famous ballet dancers was killed on the battlefield. The BBC\u2019s Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse was at his funeral.  \n\nThe series producer is Estelle Doyle. The producers are Ivana Davidovic and Arsenii Sokolov. The planning producer is Louise Hidalgo. The technical producer is Emma Crowe. The editor is Jonathan Aspinwall. Email Ukrainecast@bbc.co.uk with your questions and comments.

The station in eastern Ukraine is a major evacuation point and the attack has killed at least 50 people. \n\nAlso, why does Putin need a victory by the 9th of May? Since 1945 \u2018Victory Day\u2019 has been a national celebration in Russia, marking Nazi surrender in the Second World War. Sam de Bendern, a political risks consultant and former NATO Ukraine officer, explains how Putin is feeling the pressure to celebrate a significant \u2018victory\u2019 in Ukraine on that day. But with the invasion not going to plan, what does Russia now consider \u2018success\u2019 to be? And what happens when Putin gets desperate?\n\nAnd we catch up with Olga Malchevska from the BBC Ukrainian Service, whose family has now fled Ukraine. But with her nephew still hiding whenever he hears a plane, the psychological impact of war is something that is not easily shaken.\n\nToday's episode was made by Estelle Doyle with Natalie Ktena, Osman Iqbal and Phil Marzouk. The studio director was Emma Crowe. The editor was Jonathan Aspinwall."

The capital has come under attack, but the residents and their president remain defiant, and Russian forces have so far failed to break through their resistance.\n\nMaxim Karaush was at home with family when their apartment building in Kyiv was hit by a missile. He tells Victoria and Gabriel why, after his wife and son were injured and his home destroyed, he asked to speak to us.\n\nWe aim to explain a fast-moving conflict and answer your questions about the war. Vitaly is with us again too, and he's been following a group of Ukrainian men in England as they prepare to return to fight for their homeland.\n\nThis episode of Ukrainecast was made by Estelle Doyle with Daniel Wittenberg and Phil Marzouk. The editor is Jonathan Aspinwall."
