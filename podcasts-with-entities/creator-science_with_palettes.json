First, I joined Pat Flynn and the SPI time when Unreal Collective was acquired.\nThat was a scary decision to make, and it wasn't easy to make either! But it was absolutely the right call for a few reasons:\n\nI had the opportunity to lead the Community Experience team.\n\nIt gave Unreal members the opportunity to join an even better membership (for free)\n\nI worked alongside an amazing team and saw how a creator business at scale operates.\n\nIt allowed me to focus on the non-service-related aspects of my own content business.\n\nAs a result, my overall business income increased nearly 50% this year. And while my 2020 income was nearly 70% service-based, less than 2% of my 2021 income was service-based.\nIt's been an amazing year, and I feel so fortunate. The business is in a place now where I can truly be intentional about what I create, who I partner with, where I invest my energy, and more. And YOU have had a big part in that.\nBut I want to highlight some of the other lessons I've learned this year that I think can serve you in your life as a creator too.\nSubscribe to my newsletter\nTwitter thread on why community is hard\nFull transcript and show notes\n***\nIF YOU LOVE CREATIVE ELEMENTS\nFollow Creative Elements on Instagram\nLeave me a voicemail\nSubscribe to weekly episode emails\nLeave a review on Apple Podcasts\nBuy Me A Coffee\n***\nABOUT JAY CLOUSE\nLearn more about me\nSubscribe to my newsletter, Creative Companion\nConnect with me on Twitter\nConnect with me on Instagram\nJoin #Tweet100\n***\nSPONSORS\nSign up for ButcherBox\nGet a free 45-day extended trial of Canva Pro\nGet a free month of Blinkist Premium\nGet 50% off your first three months of Sendinblue's premium account with promo code CREATIVE\n***\nFOR PODCASTERS\nEnroll in my podcasting workshop\nEnroll in my course on podcasting, Podcast Like The Pros\nLearn more about Podpage\n***\nPODGLOMERATE NETWORK\nThis show is a part of the\u00a0Podglomerate\u00a0network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.
