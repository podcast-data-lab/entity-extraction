                "summary": "Manchester United ended their five year trophy drought by beating Newcastle United in the League Cup final.\n\nWe discuss if this is the symbolic start of something good for Erik Ten Hag and his team, and if the League Cup is a minor or major trophy\u2026\nIn Scotland, Celtic win another League Cup and we ponder if the dominance of Ange Postecoglou\u2019s side will keep on going. Forever.\u00a0\n\nTottenham find themselves in the top four after beating a defensively and offensively lacklustre Chelsea 2-0. At this point, the redemption arc for Graham Potter at Chelsea is going to be quite epic if it does come\u2026\n\nWe talk for a bit about quite how drastic the collapse in standards at Liverpool has been, and Jon gets very excited about Javi Gracia\u2019s first game, and victory; as Leeds United manager.\n\nPlus, we briefly look at how Paris St Germain will probably win Ligue Un again but probably not the Champions League.\n\nAnd, even more briefly, we cast our eyes over the last 16 draw for the Europa League, Europe\u2019s second most major, or minor; cup competition.\n\nThis episode of the Tifo football podcast is presented by Michael Bailey and produced by Steve Hankey.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

So instead we spoke about Chelsea's new lengthy contracts.\u00a0\n\nAre they an unusual outlier or a presage of things to come?\n\nWe move on to a win for West Ham in Frank Lampard's last game as Everton manager.\u00a0\n\nDid we record before he was sacked? Of course we did.\n\nThere was also an inexplicable amount of discussion about cows in this episode.\n\nThe Tifo football podcast is presented by Joe Devine and produced by Steve Hankey.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

A little bit about Tony, he has written several books about Liverpool and was previously the football editor of The Times. He now regularly contributes to ESPNFC and the Evening Standard. In this episode, he examines the dark days of the 80's through the lens of Heysel and the 1985-1986 season. Specifically, we discuss hooliganism, TV blackouts, and how football reflected the political culture of the time.\n\nThe book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Two-Tribes-Liverpool-Everton-Brink/dp/0593075927/ref=sr_1_10?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1514988541&sr=1-10&refinements=p_n_publication_date%3A182243031\u200b\n\n\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
