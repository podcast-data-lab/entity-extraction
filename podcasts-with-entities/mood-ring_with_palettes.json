You can help us out by filling out a short audience survey: <a href=\"http://moodringshow.org/survey\">moodringshow.org/survey</a></p><br/><p>Follow Mood Ring <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/moodringshow\">@moodringshow</a></p><br/><p>Follow Anna <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/annabroges\">\u200b\u200b@annabroges</a></p><br/><p>Mood Ring is a production of American Public Media and Pizza Shark!\u00a0<br></p><br/><p><strong>Full Transcript</strong></p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: There\u2019s this old book that I\u2019m willing to bet at least some of you found formative. It\u2019s called The Care and Keeping of You.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And I hope some of you just went OH, THAT BOOK, but you know for the uninitiated, The Care and Keeping of You is this illustrated American Girl guidebook and it was the first real introduction a lot of us got to our bodies and how to take care of them. It covered everything from how to sit when inserting a tampon to you know proper armpit shaving technique.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Legions of preteens referred to that book like a user&#39;s manual, myself included. You know, learning as much as we could about maintaining these weird changing bodies that we did not know the first thing about. Understanding what was going on with my body and like the ins and outs in taking care of it made me feel \u2014 I mean I don\u2019t want to oversell it but it did \u2014 it made me feel like confident and grown up and empowered, or at least more capable of handling the horrors of middle school such as like changing in the locker room and wondering why my boobs looked so much different than everyone else&#39;s.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>These days, I\u2019m kind of still chasing that high if I&#39;m honest. Like shockingly, huh-huh, taking care of myself as an adult is hardly as satisfying as The Care and Keeping of You once had me believe.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MUSIC FADE OUT</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But as I grew up, I did discover that there are a lot of other things that I can take care of, other than myself, and some of them even come with the step-by-step instructions that I was craving. And it turns out, the care and keeping of something else can be as satisfying as the care and keeping of us.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hey,\u00a0 I\u2019m Anna Borges, and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings even when you\u2019re feeling less than capable of taking care of yourself.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve probably said \u201ccare\u201d enough times for you to get that we\u2019re talking about care today. Care for ourselves. Care for some thing. And caring for ourselves by way of caring for that something.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>If you haven\u2019t guessed, I\u2019m on the lookout for something new to take care of because honestly I have not been that great of a job at taking care of myself lately. And sometimes, when we lose trust in our ability to take care of ourselves, I don&#39;t know, we need to find ways to prove to ourselves that we still can.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC FADE OUT</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>At least, that\u2019s where I&#39;m at lately. There are a lot of reasons to take care of something for our mental health, whether it\u2019s by giving ourselves a source of purpose or passion or peace or simple satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So what are we taking care of?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>There are the obvious suspects: things that rely on you for nourishment and support, like pets or plants or children. But we can also find meaning in caring for nonliving things too -\u00a0 things like our homes, cars, beaches, sneakers, closets \u2014 and in the case of our guest today, bikes.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Our guest today is a woman of many talents. Jen\u00e9 Etheridge is a music producer, DJ, community organizer and an avid cyclist.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>She tells us about her relationship with her bike, how she cares for it as she travels the world with it. And how it in turn feeds her mental health.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I would love to just hear how you got into cycling. I just never really got into it. It kind of scared me, but what&#39;s your story?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah, so I was in college at The University of Washington in Seattle, and I just needed a way to get around. Also I had a friend um who rode with me like casually. We would go on casual rides and I told him I would have a new commute from U district to SoDo, which is like six miles.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And he was like, yeah, I don&#39;t think you can do it. And I was like, oh, you don&#39;t think I can do it? and basically I was like, I&#39;m gonna do it. It was like motivation for me to, you know, prove him wrong.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: My favorite type of origin story.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: [laughter] Yeah. This is like a theme throughout my life. It&#39;s like, if people say I can&#39;t do it, I&#39;m like, oh, okay\u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Watch me.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: [laughter] I&#39;m Gonna do it then. Yeah. So I just started commuting to work to work, that&#39;s how I got started. I just, you know, just did it out of necessity to start and then it just grew from there.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And then when I moved to Portland, you know, it&#39;s like a really big cycling city, so it was really easy to get plugged in. And then I started learning more about Does this bike fit me? Like What kind of gearing works for the riding that I do? and, and things like that. So yeah.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: When did it go from, cuz it sounded like it went from like transit to something you enjoyed pretty quickly with all the sight seeing, but when did it become your thing or one of your things?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: I would say just you start craving it when you don&#39;t do it for a while.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Mmm</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: I also did have more community in Portland and I think that definitely helped me like realize it was my thing because it was mostly like women, trans femme, people of color in Portland who rode bikes, which is like a very small community, but they&#39;re very empowering and I would just be like, I don&#39;t know if I can do this. That sounds crazy. And they&#39;re like, yeah, you can. Why don\u2019t, why do you think you can&#39;t do it? You know?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely. So speaking of the bike, tell me about your relationship with it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Umm okay yeah it&#39;s cream colored. I named it Butter because um.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Ohhh</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: The first time I rode it, I&#39;m like, this is so smooth. Like butter, like -</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Perfect.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: If you were to describe what Butter means to you, how would you describe that?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: [laughter] Um I would say the feeling of like autonomy. Just being able to like leave and go whenever I want to.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: I don&#39;t know, it becomes an extension of you when you only have one bike for like everything, you know, your body gets accustomed to it. [laughter]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I love the idea of like the bike is an extension of you.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah I mean you really have to be aware and just like aware of your surroundings. And so I&#39;m trusting like my body a lot</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: And also my bike to get me through like just to get to the destination. [laughter]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Oh man. I relate to that in exactly one small way. Cause before this, I was talking to my producer about how, I had an opportunity to get ages ago, um, a motorcycle license and I thought it&#39;d be like a cool thing to do.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And I almost didn&#39;t pass the test because to swerve, you have to like throw yourself to the side. Like you&#39;re gonna like throw yourself down to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And then like yank it back up. And so you can kind of like jump around whatever you&#39;re swerving around. And like I did not have that trust.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I did not have that trust in myself to pull myself back up. I did not have trust in the bike to not just like\u2014poooffffff</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. You have to like lean your way into it. Like you really have to like trust. Your capabilities and the capabilities of the bike too, to just like get through these situations.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s like when you, um, do something kind of scary or dangerous and then you make it out and you&#39;re like, oh, okay. Like I know, um, I know that wasn&#39;t as bad as it looked or at least like I know a little more about how to, you know, handle the bike better next time. So I feel safer. That&#39;s a good feeling.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I love that. So it\u2019s \u2014 now I&#39;m just like Oh, you grow with your bike! I get, I get like, feels about like literally anything.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9:\u00a0 [laughter]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: So, don&#39;t mind me just sitting here, like with heart eyes. But let&#39;s talk about care then.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Like how do you care like how do you take care of your bike?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Okay. Well, I mean like there&#39;s normal bike maintenance, right? Like you take it to the shop, you just make sure like the chain is looped up and all the, you know, components are working right.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But I think\u00a0 part of taking care of it is like trusting other people to take care of it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Mmm</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Like having relationships with these bike shops, so basically when they see the bike, they already know they&#39;re like, oh, that&#39;s Jene\u2019s bike. And I think that&#39;s, like having that relationship established can help with the care process, if that makes sense.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah. Totally. And I&#39;m like metaphorical, cuz if we&#39;re talking about, you know, taking care of, um, like things to take care of ourselves, trusting other people to take care of us too.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah. yeah.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: What does it what does it look like to travel with the bike? Does that require different maintenance?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah I mean I basically have to deconstruct the bike, so I have to like take the wheels off, like un- unscrew a lot of parts so that they can break apart essentially. And then they fit all snug in my bike bag. Um, and then I&#39;ll put it back together once I get to wherever destination I&#39;m at.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And if I can, I&#39;ll try and get like a tune up or just have a bike friend look at it just to make sure everything&#39;s running smoothly.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So , but it&#39;s like, it is crazy. Like it\u2019s taken \u2014 it\u2019s broken apart essentially. I put it together myself and then I&#39;m like, all right, here we go.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And just [laughter] you have to like trust that all the screws are tightened and everything to start riding so</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Totally so when you&#39;re like breaking it down and putting it back together so much, is that a ritual that you enjoy or is it more kind of just something you have to do when you&#39;re traveling?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah I like it. It&#39;s like very empowering to be able to take it apart and put it back together and then just start riding immediately.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: After the break, we talk more about how Butter and Jen\u00e9 care for one another.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. I\u2019m Anna Borges. Before the break, we were talking to cyclist Jen\u00e9 Etheridge about her relationship with her bike and how taking care if it helps build a sense of trust in herself. Let\u2019s dive back in.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC OUT</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah\u00a0 feel like when I first moved to Mexico city, um, I didn&#39;t know anyone at all.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Mm.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: When I got there, it was January, 2021. So we were like still in like pandemic, deep pandemic mode.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Oh and moving to a new place during a pandemic too. Ugh.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: It was, it was so quiet.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: It was my second time in Mexico city, but it was, I remember I was just happy to be there because it was sunny and being from Portland in January, there\u2019s no sun.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: No. Gray skies forever.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah. Yeah. And so, um, I mean, I was kind of lonely. I would just kind of ride a lot, uh, in the beginning and</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah like what was your relationship to your bike like at the time?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: So I moved there for six months in the beginning and for some reason I didn&#39;t bring my bike.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: [gasp]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: I don&#39;t know why.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Oh my god</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: You were separated from Butter.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah. And so being reunited, I was like, oh my God, this is like the best feeling. Nothing feels like your bike when you&#39;re riding, like it&#39;s just completely different.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And, so it was just nice to finally have that and like be reunited and be able to take care of it and like, make sure everything was up and running smoothly.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I love \u2013 and like something familiar when you hadn&#39;t found your people yet in a new city.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah, Totally.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Oh I love that</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah. Yeah. It was super fun.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: We were talking about how, um, just like the concentration that is required to be on a bike is probably the closest thing that I will get to meditation because then I can&#39;t be in my head, you know?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Cause I have to like think of what to do and how not to die. Maybe that&#39;s a dramatic way of thinking of it, but \u2014</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Mm-hmm yeah. I feel that for sure.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>You can really be out of your head when you&#39;re riding. Like I would say a lot of the, you know, the to-do list and every day small things kind of just, you can&#39;t be thinking about it cuz you&#39;re riding. Sometimes we&#39;re riding for like hours, but then you start kind of getting into this more meditative mode that&#39;s like just reflecting on things on like a deeper way, because you have less distractions.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Like you can&#39;t be really looking at your phone, uh, once you get out of the city and you&#39;re just riding, you know, know on more secluded roads, you&#39;re really just like with your thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And then also you, you get really close to the people that you ride with because you&#39;re talking for literally hours.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I did enter, you know, with a hypothesis around taking care of things, being, you know, good for our mental health and I\u2019m \u2014 how much do you relate to the idea that taking care of something can benefit your mental health? Like does that resonate with you?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah and it&#39;s like, I put it through a lot, you know, like we&#39;ll be just going on these trips in Mexico. You know, we take charter buses and you just have to put it in the back in the back of the bus or under the bus with all those suitcases and stuff.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And so you&#39;re like kind of risking a lot or when I&#39;m doing gravel rides, like you&#39;re just riding through this crazy terrain</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Mmmm.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: And maybe falling because that just happens like when it&#39;s rough terrain.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And so being able to like to bring it back to life or just like, you know, travel with it and then get back home and be like, okay, Butter. I know I just put you through a lot.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: [laughter]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: We&#39;re gonna go to the shop, make sure everything&#39;s good to go.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And then, you know, to be able to do that is nice. Um, and yeah, you&#39;re just like, you know, building a relationship in some way.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I love that so much. I&#39;m like grinning like an idiot.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: One thing I did want to ask, does your bike take care of you in any ways?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: I mean yeah It challenges me every time I ride it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: I&#39;m like focusing on making myself stronger.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So yeah. At the time, yeah, Am I suffering? Yeah. Yeah. It definitely sucks.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But most of the time I feel great after the ride, you know, and I never regret going, um, unless I crash or something but [laughter] yeah.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I would say like, it takes care of me just through challenging myself and I&#39;m having to trust this machine to get me like hundreds of miles sometimes to a destination.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So that definitely feels like care cuz I guess it&#39;s the medium to, to travel and to get to the destination, um, in a way that&#39;s like a little more intimate than taking a plane or a bus.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: [laughter] Yeah. I don&#39;t think I ever wanna think of taking a bus as intimate in my life.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: [laughter]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: But uh, thank you so much for sharing and for having this whole conversation with me and letting me pick your brain about your bike.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: Yeah of course</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Thank you so much for, for chatting with me today. I almost want to get a bike, but probably won&#39;t be.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: No, I think you should.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I mean, to each their own, like I said, but, um, I would recommend it definitely to anyone who just like, wants to get outta their comfort zone, explore places that you would never see by car, by train, by horse even [laughter]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of listeners who are like absolutely. Actually going to go out and do this.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: But like, fuck the horse. I&#39;m gonna get a bike.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: [laughter]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jen\u00e9: [laughter]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: When I think of how empowered Jen\u00e9 described feeling by her ability to take care of her bike, I couldn\u2019t help but think of that like oft-repeated idea that you can&#39;t care for others until you care for yourself. And I know that\u2019s true in some ways but in a lot of ways I know so many of us who have the opposite experience too. Like, taking care of other things teaches us to take care of ourselves. Or you know, at least inspires us to.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>My cats remind me to take care of myself all the time\u2014just last month, I remembered I was due for a visit to the doctor because little Francis needed to see the vet. And I was like oh I guess I need to see the vet too. The people vet. </p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, one friend of mine always remembers to hydrate when she&#39;s watering her plants and then another pours themself into like keeping their Jeep in pristine condition whenever they\u2019re feeling like out of control or overwhelmed.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>All of that is to say, I like wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you already have things in your life that you take care of, even if don\u2019t really think about it that way.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So if you\u2019re up for it, I have a challenge for you. Actually, hey, a challenge for us\u2014I think I could probably use this right now, too. Alright. Let\u2019s think of something we\u2019ve taken care of, past or present. Like pet, a friend, a plant, an inanimate object, a space, anything. Whatever it is, let\u2019s take one small way we\u2019ve shown that something care or love or tenderness and offer it to ourselves, too.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll report back what I wind up doing on Twitter and Instagram\u2014my handles in the credits per usual. Meet me there and tell me what you tried. I look forward to hearing all about it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Until next time, everybody take care. Quite literally take care. Of something.

            "contentSnippet": "There are a lot of reasons to take care of something \u2014 like a plant, or a car or a house. It can be a source of purpose or passion or peace or simple satisfaction. Today we\u2019re exploring how taking care of something can be a form of self-care.\u00a0\n\nHost Anna Borges talks with Jen\u00e9 Etheridge \u2014 music producer, DJ, community organizer, and an avid cyclist \u2014 about how caring for her bike Butter feeds her mental health.\u00a0\n\nHey Mood Ring listeners, we want to hear what you think about Mood Ring! You can help us out by filling out a short audience survey: moodringshow.org/survey\n\nFollow Mood Ring @moodringshow\n\nFollow Anna \u200b\u200b@annabroges\n\nMood Ring is a production of American Public Media and Pizza Shark!\u00a0\n\nFull Transcript\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: There\u2019s this old book that I\u2019m willing to bet at least some of you found formative. It\u2019s called The Care and Keeping of You.\n\n\u00a0\nMUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nAnd I hope some of you just went OH, THAT BOOK, but you know for the uninitiated, The Care and Keeping of You is this illustrated American Girl guidebook and it was the first real introduction a lot of us got to our bodies and how to take care of them. It covered everything from how to sit when inserting a tampon to you know proper armpit shaving technique.\n\n\u00a0\nLegions of preteens referred to that book like a user's manual, myself included. You know, learning as much as we could about maintaining these weird changing bodies that we did not know the first thing about. Understanding what was going on with my body and like the ins and outs in taking care of it made me feel \u2014 I mean I don\u2019t want to oversell it but it did \u2014 it made me feel like confident and grown up and empowered, or at least more capable of handling the horrors of middle school such as like changing in the locker room and wondering why my boobs looked so much different than everyone else's.\n\n\u00a0\nThese days, I\u2019m kind of still chasing that high if I'm honest. Like shockingly, huh-huh, taking care of myself as an adult is hardly as satisfying as The Care and Keeping of You once had me believe.\n\n\u00a0\nMUSIC FADE OUT\n\n\u00a0\nBut as I grew up, I did discover that there are a lot of other things that I can take care of, other than myself, and some of them even come with the step-by-step instructions that I was craving. And it turns out, the care and keeping of something else can be as satisfying as the care and keeping of us.\n\n\u00a0\nTHEME MUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nHey,\u00a0 I\u2019m Anna Borges, and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings even when you\u2019re feeling less than capable of taking care of yourself.\n\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ve probably said \u201ccare\u201d enough times for you to get that we\u2019re talking about care today. Care for ourselves. Care for some thing. And caring for ourselves by way of caring for that something.\n\n\u00a0\nIf you haven\u2019t guessed, I\u2019m on the lookout for something new to take care of because honestly I have not been that great of a job at taking care of myself lately. And sometimes, when we lose trust in our ability to take care of ourselves, I don't know, we need to find ways to prove to ourselves that we still can.\n\n\u00a0\nTHEME MUSIC FADE OUT\n\n\u00a0\nAt least, that\u2019s where I'm at lately. There are a lot of reasons to take care of something for our mental health, whether it\u2019s by giving ourselves a source of purpose or passion or peace or simple satisfaction.\n\n\u00a0\nSo what are we taking care of?\n\n\u00a0\nThere are the obvious suspects: things that rely on you for nourishment and support, like pets or plants or children. But we can also find meaning in caring for nonliving things too -\u00a0 things like our homes, cars, beaches, sneakers, closets \u2014 and in the case of our guest today, bikes.\n\n\u00a0\nMUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nOur guest today is a woman of many talents. Jen\u00e9 Etheridge is a music producer, DJ, community organizer and an avid cyclist.\n\n\u00a0\nShe tells us about her relationship with her bike, how she cares for it as she travels the world with it. And how it in turn feeds her mental health.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I would love to just hear how you got into cycling. I just never really got into it. It kind of scared me, but what's your story?\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah, so I was in college at The University of Washington in Seattle, and I just needed a way to get around. Also I had a friend um who rode with me like casually. We would go on casual rides and I told him I would have a new commute from U district to SoDo, which is like six miles.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd he was like, yeah, I don't think you can do it. And I was like, oh, you don't think I can do it? and basically I was like, I'm gonna do it. It was like motivation for me to, you know, prove him wrong.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: My favorite type of origin story.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: [laughter] Yeah. This is like a theme throughout my life. It's like, if people say I can't do it, I'm like, oh, okay\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Watch me.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: [laughter] I'm Gonna do it then. Yeah. So I just started commuting to work to work, that's how I got started. I just, you know, just did it out of necessity to start and then it just grew from there.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd then when I moved to Portland, you know, it's like a really big cycling city, so it was really easy to get plugged in. And then I started learning more about Does this bike fit me? Like What kind of gearing works for the riding that I do? and, and things like that. So yeah.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: When did it go from, cuz it sounded like it went from like transit to something you enjoyed pretty quickly with all the sight seeing, but when did it become your thing or one of your things?\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: I would say just you start craving it when you don't do it for a while.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Mmm\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: I also did have more community in Portland and I think that definitely helped me like realize it was my thing because it was mostly like women, trans femme, people of color in Portland who rode bikes, which is like a very small community, but they're very empowering and I would just be like, I don't know if I can do this. That sounds crazy. And they're like, yeah, you can. Why don\u2019t, why do you think you can't do it? You know?\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Absolutely. So speaking of the bike, tell me about your relationship with it.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Umm okay yeah it's cream colored. I named it Butter because um.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Ohhh\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: The first time I rode it, I'm like, this is so smooth. Like butter, like -\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Perfect.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: If you were to describe what Butter means to you, how would you describe that?\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: [laughter] Um I would say the feeling of like autonomy. Just being able to like leave and go whenever I want to.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: I don't know, it becomes an extension of you when you only have one bike for like everything, you know, your body gets accustomed to it. [laughter]\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I love the idea of like the bike is an extension of you.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah I mean you really have to be aware and just like aware of your surroundings. And so I'm trusting like my body a lot\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Yeah\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: And also my bike to get me through like just to get to the destination. [laughter]\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Oh man. I relate to that in exactly one small way. Cause before this, I was talking to my producer about how, I had an opportunity to get ages ago, um, a motorcycle license and I thought it'd be like a cool thing to do.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd I almost didn't pass the test because to swerve, you have to like throw yourself to the side. Like you're gonna like throw yourself down to the ground.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd then like yank it back up. And so you can kind of like jump around whatever you're swerving around. And like I did not have that trust.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I did not have that trust in myself to pull myself back up. I did not have trust in the bike to not just like\u2014poooffffff\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. You have to like lean your way into it. Like you really have to like trust. Your capabilities and the capabilities of the bike too, to just like get through these situations.\n\n\u00a0\nBut I don't know. It's like when you, um, do something kind of scary or dangerous and then you make it out and you're like, oh, okay. Like I know, um, I know that wasn't as bad as it looked or at least like I know a little more about how to, you know, handle the bike better next time. So I feel safer. That's a good feeling.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I love that. So it\u2019s \u2014 now I'm just like Oh, you grow with your bike! I get, I get like, feels about like literally anything.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9:\u00a0 [laughter]\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: So, don't mind me just sitting here, like with heart eyes. But let's talk about care then.\n\n\u00a0\nLike how do you care like how do you take care of your bike?\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Okay. Well, I mean like there's normal bike maintenance, right? Like you take it to the shop, you just make sure like the chain is looped up and all the, you know, components are working right.\n\n\u00a0\nBut I think\u00a0 part of taking care of it is like trusting other people to take care of it.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Mmm\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Like having relationships with these bike shops, so basically when they see the bike, they already know they're like, oh, that's Jene\u2019s bike. And I think that's, like having that relationship established can help with the care process, if that makes sense.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Yeah. Totally. And I'm like metaphorical, cuz if we're talking about, you know, taking care of, um, like things to take care of ourselves, trusting other people to take care of us too.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah. yeah.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Absolutely.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: What does it what does it look like to travel with the bike? Does that require different maintenance?\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah I mean I basically have to deconstruct the bike, so I have to like take the wheels off, like un- unscrew a lot of parts so that they can break apart essentially. And then they fit all snug in my bike bag. Um, and then I'll put it back together once I get to wherever destination I'm at.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd if I can, I'll try and get like a tune up or just have a bike friend look at it just to make sure everything's running smoothly.\n\n\u00a0\nSo , but it's like, it is crazy. Like it\u2019s taken \u2014 it\u2019s broken apart essentially. I put it together myself and then I'm like, all right, here we go.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd just [laughter] you have to like trust that all the screws are tightened and everything to start riding so\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Totally so when you're like breaking it down and putting it back together so much, is that a ritual that you enjoy or is it more kind of just something you have to do when you're traveling?\n\n\u00a0\nTHEME MUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah I like it. It's like very empowering to be able to take it apart and put it back together and then just start riding immediately.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: After the break, we talk more about how Butter and Jen\u00e9 care for one another.\n\n\u00a0\nMIDROLL\n\n\u00a0\nHey, welcome back to Mood Ring. I\u2019m Anna Borges. Before the break, we were talking to cyclist Jen\u00e9 Etheridge about her relationship with her bike and how taking care if it helps build a sense of trust in herself. Let\u2019s dive back in.\n\n\u00a0\nTHEME MUSIC OUT\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah\u00a0 feel like when I first moved to Mexico city, um, I didn't know anyone at all.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Mm.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: When I got there, it was January, 2021. So we were like still in like pandemic, deep pandemic mode.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Oh and moving to a new place during a pandemic too. Ugh.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: It was, it was so quiet.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Yeah\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: It was my second time in Mexico city, but it was, I remember I was just happy to be there because it was sunny and being from Portland in January, there\u2019s no sun.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: No. Gray skies forever.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah. Yeah. And so, um, I mean, I was kind of lonely. I would just kind of ride a lot, uh, in the beginning and\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Yeah like what was your relationship to your bike like at the time?\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: So I moved there for six months in the beginning and for some reason I didn't bring my bike.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: [gasp]\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: I don't know why.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Oh my god\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: You were separated from Butter.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah. And so being reunited, I was like, oh my God, this is like the best feeling. Nothing feels like your bike when you're riding, like it's just completely different.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd, so it was just nice to finally have that and like be reunited and be able to take care of it and like, make sure everything was up and running smoothly.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I love \u2013 and like something familiar when you hadn't found your people yet in a new city.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah, Totally.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Oh I love that\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah. Yeah. It was super fun.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: We were talking about how, um, just like the concentration that is required to be on a bike is probably the closest thing that I will get to meditation because then I can't be in my head, you know?\n\n\u00a0\nCause I have to like think of what to do and how not to die. Maybe that's a dramatic way of thinking of it, but \u2014\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Mm-hmm yeah. I feel that for sure.\n\n\u00a0\nYou can really be out of your head when you're riding. Like I would say a lot of the, you know, the to-do list and every day small things kind of just, you can't be thinking about it cuz you're riding. Sometimes we're riding for like hours, but then you start kind of getting into this more meditative mode that's like just reflecting on things on like a deeper way, because you have less distractions.\n\n\u00a0\nLike you can't be really looking at your phone, uh, once you get out of the city and you're just riding, you know, know on more secluded roads, you're really just like with your thoughts.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd then also you, you get really close to the people that you ride with because you're talking for literally hours.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I did enter, you know, with a hypothesis around taking care of things, being, you know, good for our mental health and I\u2019m \u2014 how much do you relate to the idea that taking care of something can benefit your mental health? Like does that resonate with you?\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah and it's like, I put it through a lot, you know, like we'll be just going on these trips in Mexico. You know, we take charter buses and you just have to put it in the back in the back of the bus or under the bus with all those suitcases and stuff.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd so you're like kind of risking a lot or when I'm doing gravel rides, like you're just riding through this crazy terrain\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Mmmm.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: And maybe falling because that just happens like when it's rough terrain.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd so being able to like to bring it back to life or just like, you know, travel with it and then get back home and be like, okay, Butter. I know I just put you through a lot.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: [laughter]\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: We're gonna go to the shop, make sure everything's good to go.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd then, you know, to be able to do that is nice. Um, and yeah, you're just like, you know, building a relationship in some way.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I love that so much. I'm like grinning like an idiot.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: One thing I did want to ask, does your bike take care of you in any ways?\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: I mean yeah It challenges me every time I ride it.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Yeah\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: I'm like focusing on making myself stronger.\n\n\u00a0\nSo yeah. At the time, yeah, Am I suffering? Yeah. Yeah. It definitely sucks.\n\n\u00a0\nBut most of the time I feel great after the ride, you know, and I never regret going, um, unless I crash or something but [laughter] yeah.\n\n\u00a0\nI would say like, it takes care of me just through challenging myself and I'm having to trust this machine to get me like hundreds of miles sometimes to a destination.\n\n\u00a0\nSo that definitely feels like care cuz I guess it's the medium to, to travel and to get to the destination, um, in a way that's like a little more intimate than taking a plane or a bus.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: [laughter] Yeah. I don't think I ever wanna think of taking a bus as intimate in my life.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: [laughter]\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: But uh, thank you so much for sharing and for having this whole conversation with me and letting me pick your brain about your bike.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: Yeah of course\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Thank you so much for, for chatting with me today. I almost want to get a bike, but probably won't be.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: No, I think you should.\n\n\u00a0\nI mean, to each their own, like I said, but, um, I would recommend it definitely to anyone who just like, wants to get outta their comfort zone, explore places that you would never see by car, by train, by horse even [laughter]\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Absolutely. I'm sure there are plenty of listeners who are like absolutely. Actually going to go out and do this.\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: But like, fuck the horse. I'm gonna get a bike.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: [laughter]\n\n\u00a0\nJen\u00e9: [laughter]\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: When I think of how empowered Jen\u00e9 described feeling by her ability to take care of her bike, I couldn\u2019t help but think of that like oft-repeated idea that you can't care for others until you care for yourself. And I know that\u2019s true in some ways but in a lot of ways I know so many of us who have the opposite experience too. Like, taking care of other things teaches us to take care of ourselves. Or you know, at least inspires us to.\n\n\u00a0\nMy cats remind me to take care of myself all the time\u2014just last month, I remembered I was due for a visit to the doctor because little Francis needed to see the vet. And I was like oh I guess I need to see the vet too. The people vet. \n\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, one friend of mine always remembers to hydrate when she's watering her plants and then another pours themself into like keeping their Jeep in pristine condition whenever they\u2019re feeling like out of control or overwhelmed.\n\n\u00a0\nAll of that is to say, I like wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you already have things in your life that you take care of, even if don\u2019t really think about it that way.\n\n\u00a0\nSo if you\u2019re up for it, I have a challenge for you. Actually, hey, a challenge for us\u2014I think I could probably use this right now, too. Alright. Let\u2019s think of something we\u2019ve taken care of, past or present. Like pet, a friend, a plant, an inanimate object, a space, anything. Whatever it is, let\u2019s take one small way we\u2019ve shown that something care or love or tenderness and offer it to ourselves, too.\n\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ll report back what I wind up doing on Twitter and Instagram\u2014my handles in the credits per usual. Meet me there and tell me what you tried. I look forward to hearing all about it.\n\n\u00a0\nUntil next time, everybody take care. Quite literally take care. Of something. Ah\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nTHEME MUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nThanks for listening to Mood Ring, a production of APM Studios and Pizza Shark.

You know, activities that don\u2019t have to be productive or impressive or useful and even something you\u2019re good at. Hobbies that don\u2019t have to be anything other than\u2026enjoyable.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But a lot of things can get in the way of actually enjoying them, whether baking to relax turns into stressing about getting an Instagram-worthy loaf of bread or you get stressed out when you don\u2019t discover a secret hidden talent the first time you pick up a paintbrush. You know if you\u2019re anything like me that\u2019s exactly what I do! Letting ourselves relax and be free to do something without the expectation of a performance or an end goal is <em>hard</em>. Even more so when the something we love overlaps with what we do for a living.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>That&#39;s where the no strings attached hobby comes in.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s guest is Nichole Perkins, a writer, poet, and the host of the podcast This is Good for You, where she helps people stop feeling bad about the things that they love to do.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I also wanted to talk with her because as a creative, I assume she got the struggle of the work-hobby balance <em>well</em>. We dug into the beauty of trying things that we aren\u2019t good at and how we can still enjoy our hobbies, even if they <em>do</em> come with strings attached, like overlapping with what you do for a living.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Can I start by hearing something that you&#39;re bad at? Like something that you were just like awful at, but that you love?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: Oh, um, so I recently started trying to figure out, um, acrylic painting, abstract acrylic painting. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. I cannot draw a straight line. I cannot, I have never been able to perfect, um, a winged, you know, liner look because I cannot, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. So that&#39;s something that I know that I am bad at, and I would never like really share that work with anybody because it&#39;s so bad, but it&#39;s also been really relaxing for me.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I love that so much. so I have to ask, cause I feel like there are like two camps of people, largely there are people who can do that and enjoy that. And there are people and I&#39;m in this camp who will do that and be like, this is gonna be like relaxing. I&#39;m not gonna like pressure myself to be good. And then I still am like, but what if I want this to be good? Then I wind up in the boat of like Googling art lessons and oh my God, how do I get better at this blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So like, are you, are you in one of those camps, have you felt the pressure to become good now that you&#39;ve started?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: Yes, absolutely. Because there was like this one tutorial on YouTube that was like, you know, easy beginner thing and it was the sunset and it&#39;s supposed to be with, uh, power lines and beautiful trees and maybe like a little shadow of a house, right. And I tried to draw the power lines and I was just like, oh yeah, this is not, I can&#39;t do this. And I mean, I ended up kind of being still pleased with the results of what I had done, because it actually still looked like a purposeful painting. But I do want to get to a point where it looks really good, but I am still very\u00a0 intimidated about trying to go, you know, find actual lessons or something like that, because I feel like I&#39;m still very childish with, with, you know, learning this thing and I don&#39;t want to be in a classroom or whatever, you know, a workshop environment where there are people who are like, oh yeah, I used to draw, but then I stopped and now I&#39;m back and they&#39;re like, you know.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Or they&#39;re like, I&#39;m so bad at this. And then you look over and you&#39;re like, excuse me, if you think that\u2019s bad, don\u2019t look.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: Yes!</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: But that&#39;s the thing is like you, I want the natural talents. I wanna be naturally good at things like I don&#39;t want to have to work to be good at things.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: Yes. That&#39;s exactly my problem as well. So there are a lot of things, a lot of hobbies that I will try or say, I&#39;m gonna try. And then I get frustrated because I&#39;m not good at the first attempt. And\u2026 I really have to sit and think to myself, there are very few people who are, you know, experts at something the first time they pick it up. Like, yes, there are prodigies and all that kind of stuff. But the people that I admire on a creative level, they all had a natural talent, but they still have to practice and practice and practice and practice, you know. Like I love Prince, you know, he had natural talent, but he had to learn everything that he did and learn how to combine all of that, all of his musical skills, all of his lyricism into creating the legacy that he has now. Um, the same with like the writers that I admire. Yes, there&#39;s some, there&#39;s some natural affinity to it, but they still have to learn.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: And how do you remind yourself of that? Do you have to actually give yourself the Pep talk as you&#39;re doing it?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: I do. I have to, I have to like say okay, practice, practice, practice. It&#39;s okay. I know that this is not something that I can make a living at or that I want to make a living at. So it&#39;s okay. If it is not perfect or consumable.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Why did you pick something that you&#39;re taking classes for then or not classes, but at least like watching YouTube videos?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: But I still want to like see satisfaction in my own improvement. I just wanna be able to like sit and do it without feeling the pressure of performance or like I said, that end, that end goal.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: But you know, with writing, obviously that&#39;s very different, writing is something that, um, has been a part of my life for a very long time and I&#39;ve always known I wanted to make a career out of it. And I just didn&#39;t really know how, um, because there&#39;s so many different ways that you can become a writer or, or make a career out of writing. I still have a lot of goals that I want to accomplish. So that&#39;s, that&#39;s more when I freeze up and let, like, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a perfectionist, but that fear of someone seeing my mistakes or seeing the worst of what I can do. Um, really like puts me in a choke hold sometimes.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely. Yeah. Oh, I can&#39;t wait to dive into all the writing stuff because selfishly love writing, love, love talking, writing, and art. Can you kind of, I don&#39;t know, this is a big question, but like kind of tell me a little bit more about your like current relationship to writing? Cause I know for so many of us it&#39;s work, it&#39;s like therapeutic, it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s creative, it&#39;s personal. It&#39;s like all of these things that are like seemingly at odds for each other. And I&#39;m curious what it is kind of right now for you.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: Right now it is 90% work and then 10% just personal creativity and that personal creativity usually is my poetry. I have published a poetry book. So that was very much a goal of mine. I still, I, and I have other poetry that I would like to publish one day, but right now what pays the bills is culture writing. You know, writing books, script writing for podcasts, um, and that kind of thing. And I hope to eventually get into, um, screenwriting for film and television. Um, and I just, I want to ultimately continue to write until my dying breath.</p><br/><p>Anna: I can\u2019t lie, some days, it\u2019s harder for me to really have <em>fun</em> writing, thanks to how much I associate it with work. After the break, I explore poetry as a potential no-strings-attached hobby and we talk more about how to protect our favorite activities from outside pressures like work.</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>Anna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring! Before the break, I was talking with Nichole Perkins about why it\u2019s so helpful to have hobbies that <em>don\u2019t</em> overlap with what we do for a living. Next up, I may or may not have asked for an impromptu poetry lesson.</p><br/><p>Anna: One of the reasons that I was so excited, um, to talk to you specifically is because growing up, I used to write a lot of poetry and I never had aspirations to do it professionally. It is just, poetry is what I associate with like playful writing, exploratory writing, me writing, all this kind of thing. And so when I started thinking about, Ooh, what can I dig up for this episode? Poetry did come to, come to mind. Oh. And so I&#39;m, I&#39;m kind of curious if I like asked if, like, if I asked you to just write a really God awful poem right now, like where would you start?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: Oh, well, for me, it, that would be, um, a rhyming poem. Um, and not just like in iambic pentameter, like I, I do try to do like, um, um, inside rhymes or, you know, that kind of thing. Try to switch up the, you know, where the rhyme falls, but rhyming poetry has always just escaped me. Um, and I am not good at it. So if I were to try to write something that I would consider bad, it would be rhyming. Um, and making sure that like I threw in the moon\u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I do love me some moon imagery, sorry, poets.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: Right, all poets love the moon, right.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: And so who doesn&#39;t love the moon? Love my girlfriend, the moon</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: So that&#39;s where I would probably, probably start.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Why I, I think I find poetry so alluring as like an outlet like this is because I don&#39;t know what makes a good poem. Like I will read a poem and I like it, you know, or I won&#39;t like it, but that never makes me think this is a good poem or bad poem because it is like so much more subjective to me. I mean, like, I know all writing is subjective, but I&#39;m just, don&#39;t have an ear for poetry. And so like, not knowing what good is, is like freeing to me because I can&#39;t strive for it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: That&#39;s really interesting. Cuz for a lot of people who dislike poetry, part of that is because when we&#39;re in school and we&#39;re learning poetry, it is hard to say what is good and what is bad\u2026 and so it&#39;s hard for them to understand. Like what made, you know, like, [laughs] if I put this in a paragraph form, would it still, would it still have the same emotional hit? Would it still provide the same satisfaction as seeing it in its whatever format, whether it&#39;s a sonnet or, you know, um, really short broken lines, whatever. Um, so people get really frustrated cuz you, you, when you say, what is a poem? And you say, you know, it&#39;s, it&#39;s writing in verse. Well what&#39;s a verse? This, you know, short blocky paragraphs, like. Okay, well why can&#39;t we just put it in a paragraph? Why can&#39;t we just, you know, make it a, a story as opposed to a poem? And it&#39;s like, you can, you can. And the way that poetry just constantly changes. No one poem really looks like the other, um, it freaks people out because people like structure, people like rules. And one of the first things you learn about poetry is yes, this is what a sonnet is, but you can also play with the rules a little bit and change the format of a sonnet, but still call it a sonnet. And that gets people really frustrated, um, about, about poetry, right. Um, because you know, there, there are formats defined formats and then poets go in and just change them all the time. It&#39;s frustrating.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: So when you&#39;re like specifically in the, kind of like that 10%, um, that you mentioned where it&#39;s like really just for you writing, like maybe you&#39;ll hope to publish someday, but it&#39;s your time? How much are you worried about it being good versus not good? Just like for you?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: Um, this is gonna sound really\u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: No\u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: I feel like it&#39;s always good.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I believe it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: It sounds really cocky but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: No, it doesn&#39;t own it. I, I, I mean, that is why you&#39;re a poet.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: I feel so much more confident in my poetry, and when I write, when I get to a final draft of that poem, I&#39;m just like, yes, this is, this is really good. Um, and the only time that I start to doubt myself is when I start thinking, should I submit this someplace? Because that is when I feel like\u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I mean, all of those trying to anticipate reactions, that\u2019s when it starts.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: Exactly. Because it&#39;s like, when I&#39;m submitting the poem, it&#39;s not just me, my, my poem. It is against all the other submissions that are maybe dealing with more, more political topics, more cultural, uh, culture based topics or, um, you know, things like that. And so me writing about, you know, a piece of fruit may not hold up as well against a poem where someone is talking about traumatic events, you know, or something like that. Which is not to say that that poem should not be considered better than mine. Like it can be, it might be. Um, but it&#39;s just a matter of like, well, now my poem has moved from the context of my journal, into the context of the world. Can it stand up against, you know, whatever else the editors are looking at, you know, whatever else the readers are looking at.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: It has to be something.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Nichole: And so I feel when I sit down and, and write it, I feel very, yeah, just assured of myself in, that feels good. It feels good to be able to approach a creative talent with confidence. And so I try to give myself room to move from terrible painting [laugh] to really good poetry or, you know what I hope will be really good fiction.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah. Do you have any advice for people who I don&#39;t know, whatever they try and keep as like their protected space, whether that&#39;s from like trying not to monetize a hobby or not trying to like worry about being good at something like, other than just really reminding yourself of that. Do you have any advice for protecting that space or like keeping that attitude?</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Nichole: I think in this day and age, I would say try not to feel compelled to share, right. Because I think that is when we freeze up, when we think, okay, I&#39;m gonna try this new thing and I&#39;m gonna document it on my Instagram or I&#39;m trying this new thing and I&#39;m gonna send pictures to the group chat, like whatever. You don&#39;t have to. I mean, it&#39;s not to say you have to keep it private or secret. But if you&#39;re able just to hold onto it for yourself and I think that&#39;s an overall problem that a lot of people have is feeling like you cannot keep anything to yourself. You have to share. It is a proof of your love to your partner, to your parents, to, you know, your audience or whatever that you&#39;re like, I&#39;m giving you all of me, I&#39;m trying to be transparent and that kind of thing. Again, that does not mean you&#39;re keeping secrets and hiding it and like, whatever. It&#39;s just a matter of, you can hold onto something for yourself. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s not a betrayal to your, to your relationships, whatever they may be. If you hold onto something until you&#39;re ready to share it, you know?</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Anna: That&#39;s so underrated. Yeah. I feel like as someone who is pretty recognizably, a perfectionist or type A usually at like work or whatever, I find I have a really hard time explaining that sometimes keeping things to myself is for me, you know what I mean? That&#39;s not me being a perfectionist. That&#39;s me protecting myself for my perfectionist habits.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Nichole: Yeah. And, and in my, um, friendships, sometimes I don&#39;t talk about like career opportunities or whatever. And I think, you know, my friends get a little upset with me when I finally do make the announcements or like share, like, why did you tell us about this before? Or why am I finding out about this, you know, from the announcement on social media? And it&#39;s like, it&#39;s not that I am hiding it, but I&#39;m also just trying not to jinx it, you know? And that&#39;s definitely a trauma response for me where I have talked about something too soon and it&#39;s gone away, whether it was a relationship, you know, like, oh, I&#39;m talking to this guy, things are going great. And then, he disappears and I&#39;m like, Ugh, now, now it&#39;s gone. And that it&#39;s a little bit like perfectionism because it&#39;s, um, there is a fear of failure. I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t wanna talk about this thing because I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m gonna fail at it. I don&#39;t wanna talk about this guy that I&#39;m feeling because I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s gonna fail. It&#39;s, it&#39;s not gonna be a success. I don&#39;t wanna talk about this career opportunity because I am afraid that it&#39;s gonna fall through. And then you know, this, it&#39;ll be a rejection of me. Um, you know, I don&#39;t wanna talk about learning how to paint because what if I abandon it because I never get good at it. And then you keep asking me about painting and I&#39;m like, I had to stop because I was a failure.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Anna: No one ever asked Nicole about painting. If you listen to this episode, do not ruin this for her. I will be so mad at you.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Thank you so much for, for chatting. I could have continued chatting about this kind of stuff for forever, honestly.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Nichole: Thank you for having me on.\u00a0</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Anna: I thought I had a pretty good grasp on what made a good no-strings-attached activity for me. I knew it had to be fun to do badly, so I wouldn\u2019t get all perfectionist about it. And I knew I couldn\u2019t feel pressured for it to <em>be</em> something, like something I\u2019d be tempted to monetize.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>But I hadn\u2019t really noticed the theme before: We need things that are just for us. It sounds simple, but it\u2019s easy to forget all the ways we\u2019re always sharing our time and attention and\u2026well, ourselves. We multitask or document on social media or try to kill two birds with one stone with side hustles. And that\u2019s how we forget to create space for things like fucking up or being weird or creating without a goal in mind.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>So there\u2019s magic in keeping some things for ourselves to enjoy, no strings attached. I\u2019d ask you to share your <em>own</em> no-strings-attached activities, but since I just told you to keep it for yourself, how about this: Whatever it is, why do you love it and how do you protect it?</p><br/><p>Let me know and I\u2019ll see you next time.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>CREDITS<br></p>\n      ",

And there are people and I'm in this camp who will do that and be like, this is gonna be like relaxing. I'm not gonna like pressure myself to be good. And then I still am like, but what if I want this to be good? Then I wind up in the boat of like Googling art lessons and oh my God, how do I get better at this blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So like, are you, are you in one of those camps, have you felt the pressure to become good now that you've started?\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: Yes, absolutely. Because there was like this one tutorial on YouTube that was like, you know, easy beginner thing and it was the sunset and it's supposed to be with, uh, power lines and beautiful trees and maybe like a little shadow of a house, right. And I tried to draw the power lines and I was just like, oh yeah, this is not, I can't do this. And I mean, I ended up kind of being still pleased with the results of what I had done, because it actually still looked like a purposeful painting. But I do want to get to a point where it looks really good, but I am still very\u00a0 intimidated about trying to go, you know, find actual lessons or something like that, because I feel like I'm still very childish with, with, you know, learning this thing and I don't want to be in a classroom or whatever, you know, a workshop environment where there are people who are like, oh yeah, I used to draw, but then I stopped and now I'm back and they're like, you know.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Or they're like, I'm so bad at this. And then you look over and you're like, excuse me, if you think that\u2019s bad, don\u2019t look.\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: Yes!\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: But that's the thing is like you, I want the natural talents. I wanna be naturally good at things like I don't want to have to work to be good at things.\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: Yes. That's exactly my problem as well. So there are a lot of things, a lot of hobbies that I will try or say, I'm gonna try. And then I get frustrated because I'm not good at the first attempt. And\u2026 I really have to sit and think to myself, there are very few people who are, you know, experts at something the first time they pick it up. Like, yes, there are prodigies and all that kind of stuff. But the people that I admire on a creative level, they all had a natural talent, but they still have to practice and practice and practice and practice, you know. Like I love Prince, you know, he had natural talent, but he had to learn everything that he did and learn how to combine all of that, all of his musical skills, all of his lyricism into creating the legacy that he has now. Um, the same with like the writers that I admire. Yes, there's some, there's some natural affinity to it, but they still have to learn.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: And how do you remind yourself of that? Do you have to actually give yourself the Pep talk as you're doing it?\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: I do. I have to, I have to like say okay, practice, practice, practice. It's okay. I know that this is not something that I can make a living at or that I want to make a living at. So it's okay. If it is not perfect or consumable.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Why did you pick something that you're taking classes for then or not classes, but at least like watching YouTube videos?\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: But I still want to like see satisfaction in my own improvement. I just wanna be able to like sit and do it without feeling the pressure of performance or like I said, that end, that end goal.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Absolutely.\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: But you know, with writing, obviously that's very different, writing is something that, um, has been a part of my life for a very long time and I've always known I wanted to make a career out of it. And I just didn't really know how, um, because there's so many different ways that you can become a writer or, or make a career out of writing. I still have a lot of goals that I want to accomplish. So that's, that's more when I freeze up and let, like, I don't think I'm a perfectionist, but that fear of someone seeing my mistakes or seeing the worst of what I can do. Um, really like puts me in a choke hold sometimes.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Absolutely. Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to dive into all the writing stuff because selfishly love writing, love, love talking, writing, and art. Can you kind of, I don't know, this is a big question, but like kind of tell me a little bit more about your like current relationship to writing? Cause I know for so many of us it's work, it's like therapeutic, it's fun, it's creative, it's personal. It's like all of these things that are like seemingly at odds for each other. And I'm curious what it is kind of right now for you.\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: Right now it is 90% work and then 10% just personal creativity and that personal creativity usually is my poetry. I have published a poetry book. So that was very much a goal of mine. I still, I, and I have other poetry that I would like to publish one day, but right now what pays the bills is culture writing. You know, writing books, script writing for podcasts, um, and that kind of thing. And I hope to eventually get into, um, screenwriting for film and television. Um, and I just, I want to ultimately continue to write until my dying breath.\n\nAnna: I can\u2019t lie, some days, it\u2019s harder for me to really have fun writing, thanks to how much I associate it with work. After the break, I explore poetry as a potential no-strings-attached hobby and we talk more about how to protect our favorite activities from outside pressures like work.\n\nMIDROLL\n\nAnna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring! Before the break, I was talking with Nichole Perkins about why it\u2019s so helpful to have hobbies that don\u2019t overlap with what we do for a living. Next up, I may or may not have asked for an impromptu poetry lesson.\n\nAnna: One of the reasons that I was so excited, um, to talk to you specifically is because growing up, I used to write a lot of poetry and I never had aspirations to do it professionally. It is just, poetry is what I associate with like playful writing, exploratory writing, me writing, all this kind of thing. And so when I started thinking about, Ooh, what can I dig up for this episode? Poetry did come to, come to mind. Oh. And so I'm, I'm kind of curious if I like asked if, like, if I asked you to just write a really God awful poem right now, like where would you start?\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: Oh, well, for me, it, that would be, um, a rhyming poem. Um, and not just like in iambic pentameter, like I, I do try to do like, um, um, inside rhymes or, you know, that kind of thing. Try to switch up the, you know, where the rhyme falls, but rhyming poetry has always just escaped me. Um, and I am not good at it. So if I were to try to write something that I would consider bad, it would be rhyming. Um, and making sure that like I threw in the moon\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I do love me some moon imagery, sorry, poets.\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: Right, all poets love the moon, right.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: And so who doesn't love the moon? Love my girlfriend, the moon\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: So that's where I would probably, probably start.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Why I, I think I find poetry so alluring as like an outlet like this is because I don't know what makes a good poem. Like I will read a poem and I like it, you know, or I won't like it, but that never makes me think this is a good poem or bad poem because it is like so much more subjective to me. I mean, like, I know all writing is subjective, but I'm just, don't have an ear for poetry. And so like, not knowing what good is, is like freeing to me because I can't strive for it.\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: That's really interesting. Cuz for a lot of people who dislike poetry, part of that is because when we're in school and we're learning poetry, it is hard to say what is good and what is bad\u2026 and so it's hard for them to understand. Like what made, you know, like, [laughs] if I put this in a paragraph form, would it still, would it still have the same emotional hit? Would it still provide the same satisfaction as seeing it in its whatever format, whether it's a sonnet or, you know, um, really short broken lines, whatever. Um, so people get really frustrated cuz you, you, when you say, what is a poem? And you say, you know, it's, it's writing in verse. Well what's a verse? This, you know, short blocky paragraphs, like. Okay, well why can't we just put it in a paragraph? Why can't we just, you know, make it a, a story as opposed to a poem? And it's like, you can, you can. And the way that poetry just constantly changes. No one poem really looks like the other, um, it freaks people out because people like structure, people like rules. And one of the first things you learn about poetry is yes, this is what a sonnet is, but you can also play with the rules a little bit and change the format of a sonnet, but still call it a sonnet. And that gets people really frustrated, um, about, about poetry, right. Um, because you know, there, there are formats defined formats and then poets go in and just change them all the time. It's frustrating.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: So when you're like specifically in the, kind of like that 10%, um, that you mentioned where it's like really just for you writing, like maybe you'll hope to publish someday, but it's your time? How much are you worried about it being good versus not good? Just like for you?\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: Um, this is gonna sound really\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: No\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: I feel like it's always good.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I believe it.\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: It sounds really cocky but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: No, it doesn't own it. I, I, I mean, that is why you're a poet.\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: I feel so much more confident in my poetry, and when I write, when I get to a final draft of that poem, I'm just like, yes, this is, this is really good. Um, and the only time that I start to doubt myself is when I start thinking, should I submit this someplace? Because that is when I feel like\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I mean, all of those trying to anticipate reactions, that\u2019s when it starts.\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: Exactly. Because it's like, when I'm submitting the poem, it's not just me, my, my poem. It is against all the other submissions that are maybe dealing with more, more political topics, more cultural, uh, culture based topics or, um, you know, things like that. And so me writing about, you know, a piece of fruit may not hold up as well against a poem where someone is talking about traumatic events, you know, or something like that. Which is not to say that that poem should not be considered better than mine. Like it can be, it might be. Um, but it's just a matter of like, well, now my poem has moved from the context of my journal, into the context of the world. Can it stand up against, you know, whatever else the editors are looking at, you know, whatever else the readers are looking at.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: It has to be something.\n\n\u00a0\nNichole: And so I feel when I sit down and, and write it, I feel very, yeah, just assured of myself in, that feels good. It feels good to be able to approach a creative talent with confidence. And so I try to give myself room to move from terrible painting [laugh] to really good poetry or, you know what I hope will be really good fiction.\n\n\nAnna: Yeah. Do you have any advice for people who I don't know, whatever they try and keep as like their protected space, whether that's from like trying not to monetize a hobby or not trying to like worry about being good at something like, other than just really reminding yourself of that. Do you have any advice for protecting that space or like keeping that attitude?\n\n\nNichole: I think in this day and age, I would say try not to feel compelled to share, right. Because I think that is when we freeze up, when we think, okay, I'm gonna try this new thing and I'm gonna document it on my Instagram or I'm trying this new thing and I'm gonna send pictures to the group chat, like whatever. You don't have to. I mean, it's not to say you have to keep it private or secret. But if you're able just to hold onto it for yourself and I think that's an overall problem that a lot of people have is feeling like you cannot keep anything to yourself. You have to share. It is a proof of your love to your partner, to your parents, to, you know, your audience or whatever that you're like, I'm giving you all of me, I'm trying to be transparent and that kind of thing. Again, that does not mean you're keeping secrets and hiding it and like, whatever. It's just a matter of, you can hold onto something for yourself. It's okay. It's not a betrayal to your, to your relationships, whatever they may be. If you hold onto something until you're ready to share it, you know?\n\n\nAnna: That's so underrated. Yeah. I feel like as someone who is pretty recognizably, a perfectionist or type A usually at like work or whatever, I find I have a really hard time explaining that sometimes keeping things to myself is for me, you know what I mean? That's not me being a perfectionist. That's me protecting myself for my perfectionist habits.\n\n\nNichole: Yeah. And, and in my, um, friendships, sometimes I don't talk about like career opportunities or whatever. And I think, you know, my friends get a little upset with me when I finally do make the announcements or like share, like, why did you tell us about this before? Or why am I finding out about this, you know, from the announcement on social media? And it's like, it's not that I am hiding it, but I'm also just trying not to jinx it, you know? And that's definitely a trauma response for me where I have talked about something too soon and it's gone away, whether it was a relationship, you know, like, oh, I'm talking to this guy, things are going great. And then, he disappears and I'm like, Ugh, now, now it's gone. And that it's a little bit like perfectionism because it's, um, there is a fear of failure. I don't, I don't wanna talk about this thing because I'm afraid I'm gonna fail at it. I don't wanna talk about this guy that I'm feeling because I'm afraid it's gonna fail. It's, it's not gonna be a success. I don't wanna talk about this career opportunity because I am afraid that it's gonna fall through. And then you know, this, it'll be a rejection of me. Um, you know, I don't wanna talk about learning how to paint because what if I abandon it because I never get good at it. And then you keep asking me about painting and I'm like, I had to stop because I was a failure.\n\n\nAnna: No one ever asked Nicole about painting. If you listen to this episode, do not ruin this for her. I will be so mad at you.\n\n\nThank you so much for, for chatting. I could have continued chatting about this kind of stuff for forever, honestly.\n\n\nNichole: Thank you for having me on.\u00a0\n\n\nAnna: I thought I had a pretty good grasp on what made a good no-strings-attached activity for me. I knew it had to be fun to do badly, so I wouldn\u2019t get all perfectionist about it. And I knew I couldn\u2019t feel pressured for it to be something, like something I\u2019d be tempted to monetize.\n\n\nBut I hadn\u2019t really noticed the theme before: We need things that are just for us. It sounds simple, but it\u2019s easy to forget all the ways we\u2019re always sharing our time and attention and\u2026well, ourselves. We multitask or document on social media or try to kill two birds with one stone with side hustles. And that\u2019s how we forget to create space for things like fucking up or being weird or creating without a goal in mind.\n\n\nSo there\u2019s magic in keeping some things for ourselves to enjoy, no strings attached. I\u2019d ask you to share your own no-strings-attached activities, but since I just told you to keep it for yourself, how about this: Whatever it is, why do you love it and how do you protect it?\n\nLet me know and I\u2019ll see you next time.\n\n\nCREDITS",

Try to remember a quintessential childhood moment, something that encapsulates the <em>best</em> parts of being a kid. Getting lost in your own backyard. Long summer days. Cartoons in your jammies. Playing make-believe. Can you remember the feeling of possibility and wonder?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: That is Georgina Hahn, one of our producers on the show. And she\u2019s telling us about something that\u2019s very close to her heart - letting our inner child out so our most authentic selves can shine. And she even has a name for it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: I call it Lamby. Lamby is writing in my room, surrounded by the soft and tender, exploring my thoughts and feelings. It\u2019s waking up to my roommates cooking breakfast, and cuddling my stuffed Lamby in my matching adult-sized pajama set.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s about so much more than that, too. Lamby is kind of a way of life for me, reaching out to my inner child, taking care of her, looking out for her, helps me create a life of curiosity and openness. To go easy and not be so concerned with what other people think. It\u2019s about giving ourselves permission to be, well, unapologetically Lamby.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MOOD RING THEME</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I\u2019m Anna Borges, and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings\u2014especially the feelings so specific, you make up words for them.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>As you might have guessed, I tapped Georgie to kick us off because\u2014well, I\u2019m not very lamby. Or at least, I didn\u2019t think I was when Georgie first introduced me to the idea. It sounded cute and optimistic and <em>happy,</em> and when Georgie explained it to me with like the earnestness of a baby lamb, I had to admit to her that I had never related to anything less in my life.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So, naturally, we had to do an episode on it. That is the challenge we set for ourselves, right? To occasionally give something a try, even when you\u2019re convinced it is <em>not</em> for you.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Which is exactly why I wanted Georgie to steer us today, so we could learn direct from the source: what <em>can </em>channeling our inner child look like when we don\u2019t associate childhood with tenderness and softness? Or, what might be getting in our way? First, I talked to Georgie about all things Lamby.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: For our listeners, but also still for me, I feel like I go back and forth whether or not I understand Lamby, so, what is Lamby, when and how did you come up with it?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: Okay. Lamby is being unapologetically connected to your inner child and those desires and being tender and being soft and also really leading with that, putting that on your sleeve and putting the sort of gentle vibe forward. And it came about from a stuffed animal that my grandma sent me on Easter when I was 20 or 21, living with my best friend. And we got this like cute little lamb and we would like, just bring her everywhere and do photo shoots with her. And like, just like she was a character in our house. When I moved to New Mexico, I had a radio show called the Lamby Hour on a community radio station. I made a ton of friends through the radio show who were all Lamby? And so I was like, just really beautiful that I feel like the, the energy I was putting out there was really coming back to me and who I was getting to know.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: What I love is before this interview, I was like, please use Lamy in a sentence. Is it a verb? Is it an adjective? And it, it&#39;s like a state of mind, it could be an adjective. Like you&#39;re so Lamby. But it&#39;s also kind of stands out as like a value, like a value system for how you make decisions in your life. You know, like, is this Lamby, is this not Lamby? This place is not Lamby. This place is Lamby. It&#39;s, I&#39;m, I&#39;m really into it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgina: A hundred percent. And I think also it helps me sort of make decisions about like what environments I put myself into. Cuz it just feels like so important that I like try and keep that constant in, in terms of like the people that I spend time with, the activities, the, the food, the clothes, like literally down to just like how I feel in my body.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: So, if people who are listening are also kind of doing the same thing, like, what is that for me? Do you have a recommendation of where they start?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: I think it&#39;s just noticing when do I feel cozy? Kind of like when, when do I feel like safe? Is it just that moment when I make myself a cup of coffee and like feel the warmth to my body? Like who are the people and what are resources around me that are going to kind of evoke that feeling?\u00a0 I think also like putting aside some time each week to be like, I&#39;m just, I&#39;m going to have an afternoon to myself and just do what I&#39;m gonna enjoy doing. [Anna: Mhmm] Also, yeah, like when you wake up, like, okay, is there any room for some Lambiness today? Is there any like, anything on my agenda that I can approach with softness instead of, um, my usual hardness?<br><br>Anna: Have you, have you felt pressure to not be Lamby and like had to reclaim your lambiness?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: I think it was hard in high school and college to be in a very like, like NYU was so cool. You know, like everyone was trying to be so edgy and cool that I think it took a long time to stop trying to be cool and just embracing kind of the nerd. It\u2019s not even nerdy but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Ooh, this thing that Georgie completely made up is speaking to me. But as people may or may not know, if they follow me on twitter I recently fell back into like being like into fandom and fanfic too. And like, I&#39;ve like kind of like been unabashed about talking about it with like people I work with and some of them are like, I don&#39;t know how to respond to this. Like isn&#39;t\u2019 that a weird thing? And I&#39;ve like, felt like, so for lack of a better word, annoying, but it&#39;s because I&#39;m not like worrying about sounding cool. And the kind of like unselfconscious, I don&#39;t know enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: Yeah. And I think to be honest, you will weed some people out, like some people will be like, that&#39;s weird. But then on the other side you&#39;ll then become like a magnet for people who are your same kind of vibe. And that&#39;s really cool to see happen.</p><br/><p>Anna: Okay, so I did find a way to connect with this idea after all. But I still wondered\u2026 what do you do if this lamby stuff doesn\u2019t come so easily? After the break, we talk with someone who helps us understand our inner child. Stay with us.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>MOOD RING THEME</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Anna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. Before the break, our producer Georgina Hahn and I were chatting through some ways we can channel our inner child. But even though I was starting to get on board with the concept, I still had some questions. Like, what happens if my inner child wasn\u2019t very joyful or tender or free? What if I\u2019m not sure <em>who</em> I\u2019m connecting with?</p><br/><p>To help, I talked with Bernice Angoh, a writer, mystic, poet and author of <em>Dear Me: Love letters to my inner child</em>. She gave us some more perspective on how connecting with our inner child often needs to start from a place of healing and discovery.</p><br/><p>Anna: If you could kick us off by telling us a little bit more about inner child work and what that even means, I&#39;d so appreciate it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bernice: Oh, okay. No problem. First of all, how do we define the inner child? I define the inner child as the original you. The you before all the conditioning from culture, from religion, from society, from politics. So, who were you when you still had that sensitivity? That joie de vivre, you know, like you just had this wonder, this great imagination and that&#39;s the part of you, that&#39;s your inner child. When there were no limits to anything.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Oh man. In my head I&#39;m like, oh, who is that? I don&#39;t even know anymore. I feel like there&#39;s a lot of, a lot of bull crap piled on top of, of, of her.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bernice: A lot, a lot. Because we are born into our families and we spend so many years of our lives trying to retrace our steps, to go back to being that free unapologetic, authentic self.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely. And so inner child work is the work of, reconnecting with that authentic you.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bernice: Yes. But in order to reconnect, you, you do have to, to retrace your steps because you have to take a, a deep look into your family history, into your family dynamics, into so much of what has made you, you and into your society also. Cause a lot of the times we end up becoming what our family and society has prescribed for us. And we basically, I always say we put our inner child in a perpetual timeout. It&#39;s like, hush, I don&#39;t want to hear anything you have to say, who are you anyway? You know? And so being able to re-parent or to nurture our inner child, that&#39;s where the healing, you know, begins to be able to know where the shame comes from, where the guilt comes from, where the blame comes from, and all that hurt and hiding comes from.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Man, so how do we like begin spending like time with this inner child?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bernice: So, the first thing that I usually tell people to do is to get- look for a picture of yourself when you are a child. I have this picture of me when I was five years old, and I used to put it in my wallet. I used to put it on, you know, on my phone, on my screen. And when I start to have that negative self talk, I would look at that little girl and imagine that that&#39;s the person I&#39;m talking to. And I&#39;d be disgusted, like how dare you? You know, this child didn&#39;t know any better. They were young. They didn&#39;t, you know, they didn&#39;t deserve this to happen to them. So, you start to speak to yourself with a, with a little more tenderness and compassion and forgiveness. This child needs your guidance. This child doesn&#39;t have a clue about navigating this life. So you are the parent now to yourself, you&#39;re your own mother and father. How would you treat that you? And then you bring it back to yourself now as an adult, right? Because that&#39;s the same person.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MUSIC \u2014 lyrics: \u201cAll my clothes are slightly dirty \u2026 all my thoughts are clean \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Obviously, the first thing I wanted to do after talking with Bernice was find a picture of young me. And in the spirit of Lamby, I asked Georgie if she\u2019d find one, too.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Describe to the class what we&#39;re seeing.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: Okay. So this is a photo of me and my great-grandmother in Hungary, outside of her house. So I&#39;m wearing, like a polo dress shirt and I&#39;m wearing papucs, which are Hungarian little slippers. They&#39;re red with embroidery. And, I found a turtle that was on its back. And my great-grandmother used that broom to flip it over onto its belly.\u00a0 [Anna: oh my god] And the feeling is kind of just like, like just sort of excitement and like-</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: It looks like you&#39;re yelling. Your arms are thrown behind you [laughs].</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: I always loved being like, let&#39;s go do this. Kinda like, the catalyst.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: So the you in this picture, how, how do you think she would hope you were spending your time right now?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: Having fun, spending time with other people and doing things that are Lamby. Is that a cop out? No, like, I don&#39;t know. I just feel like young me would want the vibrant excitement and compassionate feelings to like lead my life.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: It sounds like the young you in the picture would be very happy with how you&#39;re living right now.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: I think so.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Aww, so sweet. Does this mean I have to share mine now?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: Yes. Your turn!</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: So this is me. Uh, God. Oh, there&#39;s so many different things I&#39;m now noticing about this picture now that I&#39;m gonna walk through it. This is what I consider our old house, you know, when I like dream of the old house, and it&#39;s me outside in one of those little, god, it must be even smaller than it looks because I am a small child, but like a little plastic pool and I am laying down in it. My like legs are floating, but like I&#39;m reclining against the side of the pool. And my like arms are crossed over my stomach, like comfortable. And I&#39;m smiling for the camera, which, you know, stops when you hit a certain year in my photo albums.\u00a0 And like, I&#39;m like winking because the sun was in my eye as I was like having\u00a0 this picture taken. There&#39;s someone there adding more water to the pool. There&#39;s like a football in the background. It&#39;s just like, it&#39;s very, I don&#39;t know, summer vibes. Just peaceful summer vibes. And the reason I picked it is because like very specifically, one thing that I know about myself is I really, really like being in the water. I think the most Lamby, I feel like the most expansive my world feels. So when I saw this picture, I was like, hmm, young me, in this picture would not be happy with how I was spending my summer. But I think I&#39;m getting there. Like, I think like with the creativity that I&#39;m bringing into my summer already, she&#39;s happy with that. She&#39;s also a very imaginative young girl. She loves making believe. Oh my God, the amount of make believe we played. Ugh. Oh, I love her! But yeah, I think, I think what I&#39;ve been realizing lately is she would not be the most happy with how I&#39;m spending my time.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: How would they hope you&#39;re spending your time?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I think she would want me to have more outlets for creativity and imagination. And water. Before we end, what is the lambiest thing you&#39;re gonna do today? Once we&#39;re done?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Georgie: Well, I was gonna go to the pool, so yeah, I also have great childhood pool water memories.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Thank you so much for sharing Lammy with us. I\u2019m really excited for finding my version of it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MUSIC - lyrics: I have a way for us \u2026 I have a plan for me \u2026 I know who I want to be \u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: When I sat down to write the conclusion to this episode, I read back through that last bit conversation to get my bearings and you guess what? Like, I do want to spend more time playing and less time working, so I decided to call it a wrap there and go play video games. Which means this episode is almost over. Young Me is pretty pleased with that decision. And I hope you ask your inner child what they want for you today, too.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Thank you again to our producer Georgina Hahn for sharing the magic of Lamby with us.

But then on the other side you'll then become like a magnet for people who are your same kind of vibe. And that's really cool to see happen.\n\nAnna: Okay, so I did find a way to connect with this idea after all. But I still wondered\u2026 what do you do if this lamby stuff doesn\u2019t come so easily? After the break, we talk with someone who helps us understand our inner child. Stay with us.\n\n\nMIDROLL\n\n\nMOOD RING THEME\n\n\nAnna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. Before the break, our producer Georgina Hahn and I were chatting through some ways we can channel our inner child. But even though I was starting to get on board with the concept, I still had some questions. Like, what happens if my inner child wasn\u2019t very joyful or tender or free? What if I\u2019m not sure who I\u2019m connecting with?\n\nTo help, I talked with Bernice Angoh, a writer, mystic, poet and author of Dear Me: Love letters to my inner child. She gave us some more perspective on how connecting with our inner child often needs to start from a place of healing and discovery.\n\nAnna: If you could kick us off by telling us a little bit more about inner child work and what that even means, I'd so appreciate it.\n\n\u00a0\nBernice: Oh, okay. No problem. First of all, how do we define the inner child? I define the inner child as the original you. The you before all the conditioning from culture, from religion, from society, from politics. So, who were you when you still had that sensitivity? That joie de vivre, you know, like you just had this wonder, this great imagination and that's the part of you, that's your inner child. When there were no limits to anything.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Oh man. In my head I'm like, oh, who is that? I don't even know anymore. I feel like there's a lot of, a lot of bull crap piled on top of, of, of her.\n\n\u00a0\nBernice: A lot, a lot. Because we are born into our families and we spend so many years of our lives trying to retrace our steps, to go back to being that free unapologetic, authentic self.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Absolutely. And so inner child work is the work of, reconnecting with that authentic you.\n\n\u00a0\nBernice: Yes. But in order to reconnect, you, you do have to, to retrace your steps because you have to take a, a deep look into your family history, into your family dynamics, into so much of what has made you, you and into your society also. Cause a lot of the times we end up becoming what our family and society has prescribed for us. And we basically, I always say we put our inner child in a perpetual timeout. It's like, hush, I don't want to hear anything you have to say, who are you anyway? You know? And so being able to re-parent or to nurture our inner child, that's where the healing, you know, begins to be able to know where the shame comes from, where the guilt comes from, where the blame comes from, and all that hurt and hiding comes from.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Man, so how do we like begin spending like time with this inner child?\n\n\u00a0\nBernice: So, the first thing that I usually tell people to do is to get- look for a picture of yourself when you are a child. I have this picture of me when I was five years old, and I used to put it in my wallet. I used to put it on, you know, on my phone, on my screen. And when I start to have that negative self talk, I would look at that little girl and imagine that that's the person I'm talking to. And I'd be disgusted, like how dare you? You know, this child didn't know any better. They were young. They didn't, you know, they didn't deserve this to happen to them. So, you start to speak to yourself with a, with a little more tenderness and compassion and forgiveness. This child needs your guidance. This child doesn't have a clue about navigating this life. So you are the parent now to yourself, you're your own mother and father. How would you treat that you? And then you bring it back to yourself now as an adult, right? Because that's the same person.\n\n\u00a0\nMUSIC \u2014 lyrics: \u201cAll my clothes are slightly dirty \u2026 all my thoughts are clean \u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Obviously, the first thing I wanted to do after talking with Bernice was find a picture of young me. And in the spirit of Lamby, I asked Georgie if she\u2019d find one, too.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Describe to the class what we're seeing.\n\n\u00a0\nGeorgie: Okay. So this is a photo of me and my great-grandmother in Hungary, outside of her house. So I'm wearing, like a polo dress shirt and I'm wearing papucs, which are Hungarian little slippers. They're red with embroidery. And, I found a turtle that was on its back. And my great-grandmother used that broom to flip it over onto its belly.\u00a0 [Anna: oh my god] And the feeling is kind of just like, like just sort of excitement and like-\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: It looks like you're yelling. Your arms are thrown behind you [laughs].\n\n\u00a0\nGeorgie: I always loved being like, let's go do this. Kinda like, the catalyst.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: So the you in this picture, how, how do you think she would hope you were spending your time right now?\n\n\u00a0\nGeorgie: Having fun, spending time with other people and doing things that are Lamby. Is that a cop out? No, like, I don't know. I just feel like young me would want the vibrant excitement and compassionate feelings to like lead my life.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: It sounds like the young you in the picture would be very happy with how you're living right now.\n\n\u00a0\nGeorgie: I think so.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Aww, so sweet. Does this mean I have to share mine now?\n\n\u00a0\nGeorgie: Yes. Your turn!\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: So this is me. Uh, God. Oh, there's so many different things I'm now noticing about this picture now that I'm gonna walk through it. This is what I consider our old house, you know, when I like dream of the old house, and it's me outside in one of those little, god, it must be even smaller than it looks because I am a small child, but like a little plastic pool and I am laying down in it. My like legs are floating, but like I'm reclining against the side of the pool. And my like arms are crossed over my stomach, like comfortable. And I'm smiling for the camera, which, you know, stops when you hit a certain year in my photo albums.\u00a0 And like, I'm like winking because the sun was in my eye as I was like having\u00a0 this picture taken. There's someone there adding more water to the pool. There's like a football in the background. It's just like, it's very, I don't know, summer vibes. Just peaceful summer vibes. And the reason I picked it is because like very specifically, one thing that I know about myself is I really, really like being in the water. I think the most Lamby, I feel like the most expansive my world feels. So when I saw this picture, I was like, hmm, young me, in this picture would not be happy with how I was spending my summer. But I think I'm getting there. Like, I think like with the creativity that I'm bringing into my summer already, she's happy with that. She's also a very imaginative young girl. She loves making believe. Oh my God, the amount of make believe we played. Ugh. Oh, I love her! But yeah, I think, I think what I've been realizing lately is she would not be the most happy with how I'm spending my time.\n\n\u00a0\nGeorgie: How would they hope you're spending your time?\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I think she would want me to have more outlets for creativity and imagination. And water. Before we end, what is the lambiest thing you're gonna do today? Once we're done?\n\n\u00a0\nGeorgie: Well, I was gonna go to the pool, so yeah, I also have great childhood pool water memories.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Thank you so much for sharing Lammy with us. I\u2019m really excited for finding my version of it.\n\n\u00a0\nMUSIC - lyrics: I have a way for us \u2026 I have a plan for me \u2026 I know who I want to be \u2026\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: When I sat down to write the conclusion to this episode, I read back through that last bit conversation to get my bearings and you guess what? Like, I do want to spend more time playing and less time working, so I decided to call it a wrap there and go play video games. Which means this episode is almost over. Young Me is pretty pleased with that decision. And I hope you ask your inner child what they want for you today, too.\n\n\u00a0\nThank you again to our producer Georgina Hahn for sharing the magic of Lamby with us. I couldn\u2019t have channeled my inner child without you.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nMOOD RING THEME\n\n\u00a0\nCREDITS\n\n\u00a0\nThanks for listening to Mood Ring, a production of APM Studios and Pizza Shark.

It is time for an astrology episode. Because let\u2019s be honest, I wasn\u2019t going to make it through a season of Mood Ring without one. But also because I think a lot of us could really use it right now.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>DRONING MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica Lanyadoo: People turned to astrology for lots of reasons. A big common reason\u2014especially during this global pandemic and time of social unrest\u2014is anxiety. If I&#39;m looking for a way to not feel anxious and an astrologer rattles off a ton of stuff and a ton of advice, in a way, in the short term, it&#39;s scratching that itch. I want order, I want to be told what&#39;s real. I want to be told what to do. Okay. This person&#39;s telling me. This person seems to have a grasp on the, on the universe and they&#39;re telling me what to do this week.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings \u2026 and sometimes, if I\u2019m being honest with you guys, I do wonder if being TOO practical can hold us back.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>You just heard Jessica Lanyadoo, an astrologer, psychic medium, and today\u2019s guest. I invited her on because I love astrology as a self-care tool and definitely wanted to talk about it, but, at the same time I\u2019ve always felt like there was something kind of holding me back from really getting the most out of it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Because on the one hand, I feel exactly what you just heard Jessica describing. I want to be told what to do. I want to be told what\u2019s real. I want to believe my horoscope when it tells me how I can find happiness and trust when a meme tells me that my Leo Venus means you know, I\u2019m really good at love.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But on the other hand, my skeptical little Virgo brain is like, \u201cUhhh. You don\u2019t actually believe in this, do you?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about today\u2014how we can turn down the volume on our logic and our doubt to really lean into, well as Jessica calls it, \u201cthe woo.\u201d Jessica herself specializes in helping people cultivate self-understanding and emotional intelligence through what she refers to as \u2026 woo. And I am ready to embrace the woo!</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>If you\u2019re sitting here thinking, \u201cCan\u2019t relate, fuck astrology,\u201d this doesn\u2019t just apply to that. You know, you might have another complicated relationship between something you doubt the effectiveness of, or the truth of, but that you really kind of want to believe in. Our brains reject everything from the magic of meditation to our own self-worth\u2014like haven\u2019t you ever stopped to wonder, like \u201cHey, what <em>would</em> happen if I just trusted the process? Like, would I start to believe in it? Would it work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So, that\u2019s what I wanted to talk to Jessica about. Why it\u2019s so hard to embrace the woo, and how we can.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I feel like the question that comes up whenever people talk about astrology is, do you really believe in it? Like, I hear that all the time, whenever I express an interest and I&#39;m curious: A, I mean, do you and B, what&#39;s your reaction to it?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: Hmm. I don&#39;t believe in astrology. [Anna: gasps, whispers \u201camazing\u201d] I don&#39;t believe in astrology, and I don&#39;t believe in ibuprofen and I don&#39;t believe in the internet. I use them because they work. And that&#39;s how I respond to people asking me about it. And it&#39;s also how I respond to people being like, I don&#39;t believe in astrology. I say, cool. Yeah, me neither.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: You\u2019re like no, yeah, me neither.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: It&#39;s a tool, it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a system and a tool. And I think, I should just pull back to say, when someone asks me about astrology, I don&#39;t think about memes. I don&#39;t think about apps. I don&#39;t think about AI. I don&#39;t think about sun signs. I don&#39;t think about compatibility and I don&#39;t think about stereotypes. Or like, \u201cI would never date a \u2014\u2014\u2014,\u201d to me none of that is astrology, That&#39;s like pop culture around astrology.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: That&#39;s like a good response and I&#39;m gonna steal it. Like, what do you think people are really asking when they ask, do you believe in it? Like what&#39;s real, what&#39;s beneath that question?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: It depends on who&#39;s asking. A lot of the times people have asked me that question, what they&#39;re really saying is, \u201cI went to university. I&#39;m really smart. I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m not smart. And, I just think it&#39;s fun.\u201d But usually they&#39;re trying to affirm their intellectual prowess and competency as a person and that is what they mean, I think, yeah.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: But like the reason that I start with the question of like people asking, do you believe in it is because my little gremlin brain asks that all the time. Like every time I kind of wanna like shut up and enjoy and like lean into it as a tool, in the back of my head there&#39;s like a little voice going, \u201cIs this even real? Like, what&#39;s the point of doing this?\u201d [Jessica: yep] So every time I wanna give myself to the woo, embrace the woo, logic gets in the way!</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: I, first of all, really like reclaiming words that are used to minimize or, like, belittle. So, you know, not so much anymore, it&#39;s 2022, but in the nineties I was dyke-identified because you&#39;re not gonna call me a dyke and get me, get me mad. I&#39;m going to call me a dyke and enjoy it. And woo is something like, oh, that&#39;s, woo-woo, that&#39;s like, you know, a way of being dismissive. And so I&#39;m really big on embracing it. So that&#39;s one part of it. But in terms of like, what I think woo is, I think it&#39;s a really big umbrella of \u2026 esoteric spiritualities that are not necessarily part of any kind of religion. I think they can be associated with like new age stuff. But even like, I don&#39;t even know what new age exactly means. It&#39;s woo. I can say astrologer, psychic medium, animal communicator, tarot reader, but that just feels like a lot of fucking words to confuse a person with. So woo. It just really kind of works.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely. Yeah. I, I connect with that so much, and then have like, kind of the underlayer of knowing that I probably lean on it to signal to other people who might judge, if I said astrology or tarot or whatever that like, \u201cDon&#39;t worry. I don&#39;t take it too seriously. I know it&#39;s woo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: And think like, this is, this is like, I&#39;m glad you said that because this thing of \u2026 there&#39;s so much judgment, especially towards women, or, women and femme people for being into things that are not quote \u201cproven.\u201d But I can use astrology to tell a person when a thing happened in their past, when a thing\u2019s going to happen in their future. I was able to see an airborne pandemic coming in 2020 through astrology. There&#39;s no religion that gives any kind of like \u2026 evidence. Right? Because people do attribute astrology to faith and it is spiritual, right? So it\u2019s, it&#39;s just really an interesting thing to me that people have to distance themselves to prove their intelligence. When in fact studying astrology takes years, it means learning a new language and there&#39;s a lot of math. But most people don&#39;t know that.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: This is why I can never fully embrace the woo! Math.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: Math is hard! It\u2019s not a joke.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Math is hard! [laughs] I&#39;m really glad that you mentioned like faith so early on, because when I was like getting ready for this interview and this episode, I did realize that it&#39;s like, not so much about astrology as it is, \u201cHow do I develop a sense of faith that I can trust? The same way that I&#39;m not great at trusting my gut or trusting all of these things\u201d \u2018Cause I think so many of us second guess anything that we can&#39;t point at and be like, \u201cFactual. Valid. Cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: Yes. Agreed. Well, you know, I&#39;m one of those people, I don&#39;t have faith, easily or frequently, but I, I&#39;m a fan of evidence. And so for me, I think a lot of people are surprised because I&#39;m a psychic medium and an animal communicator and astrologer, people assume that I believe in the things I do. I don&#39;t. And people who assume that I am a faith-based person. I\u2019m not. I would like to be more, honestly. And also I love evidence, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with requiring evidence of the things that guide our lives and guide our choices. But, but like to answer your question in a way that&#39;s, I think, slightly more helpful, is \u2026 it is hard to have faith in others or in, or in, other things, when we don\u2019t have faith in ourselves and we don\u2019t know how to listen to ourselves-</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Ugh!</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: I&#39;m sorry!</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>[Anna and Jessica laugh]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I mean it\u2019s true, but you don\u2019t have to say it, Jessica!</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: I know, I know. It was like I slapped you. You were like, ouch! I\u2019m so sorry. But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what it is, is like. If you give strangers on the internet\u2014or like, whatever people, your mom, your ex\u2014power over your self esteem and your identity, like if we have that habit to do that with others, then we&#39;re really likely to do it with like faith-based things. And it is a, kind of a survival mechanism to say, \u201cI&#39;m not going to believe in things if I don&#39;t know how to assess whether or not they&#39;re accurate. And if I make a mistake, I don&#39;t know how to take care of myself around that mistake.\u201d That&#39;s the key.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: There\u2019s like risk in trusting your faith or having faith.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: Yes. The risk is that you&#39;re going to be wrong. That you&#39;re gonna be silly, that you&#39;re going to be dumb. That risk is that you, you know, you will lose yourself. You will give away your power. There&#39;s so many things that people can do in the name of faith. I mean, I think it&#39;s wise to have a critical relationship with where we give our faith, with what we believe in, and the tools that we use.</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Well. Wow. Jessica just pretty much summed up exactly what\u2019s so scary about giving ourselves over to the woo, huh? It takes a lot of self-trust to let go and that can be really terrifying for many of us\u2014or I mean, at least a lot scarier than staying in control.</p><br/><p>After the break, we\u2019ll talk about how to get over that\u2014but, like, in a way that\u2019s actually true to you, I promise.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Hey all, welcome back to Mood Ring. We\u2019ve been talking with astrology and psychic Jessica Lanyado. We started with <em>why</em> it can be so hard to embrace the woo\u2014so now let\u2019s dive into how.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And trust me, the irony is not lost on me that even in an episode about woo and rejecting the practicalities that hold us back from woo, I still couldn\u2019t resist the urge to ask Jessica for practical answers. But honestly, I\u2019m glad I did. The rest of our conversation really didn\u2019t go as expected for me\u2014and I may or may not have left with an entirely new perspective. Let\u2019s dive back in.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Do you have, like, any guidance for how people who are kind of in this push and pull relationship with like belief, faith, whatever we want to call it, but want to be able to fully lean in or start leaning in? Like where do we start embracing the woo?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: That&#39;s really good question. Let me think for a second here, because\u2014let me tell you why I&#39;m like pausing to think. Because it does depend a little. Some people don&#39;t embrace the woo because they have a hard time being in emotion. [Anna: yeah] And some people have a hard time not identifying first and foremost with their intellect. And those are very different problems. And they look kind of the same on the surface, but they&#39;re very different issues and they take different remediation. I also think some people have religious damage and are scared of believing in anything because their belief was turned against them. And I think it ultimately really just does come back to figuring out how to trust yourself [Anna: yeah] And how to use tools\u2014and I would say in this context, belief is a tool\u2014as a way to make your life better and to identify whether or not it&#39;s actually not making your life better.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I love that, so like what does tapping into their intuition and deciding what to do with that information look like? Because I know that it&#39;s like, some people are more prescriptive than others, you know, like some astrologers I like, but sometimes it&#39;s very vague, like the planets are doing this and that means it might be a good time to do that or whatever. And it&#39;s, what do we do? What do we do with that? What is it like, I&#39;m like, sure. And then I forget the next day.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. So I am a fan of taking notes. If something seems important that you&#39;re reading or hearing or seeing a \u201cwoo\u201d say, I think it&#39;s important to jot it down and to then sit with like, okay, this person has said it&#39;s a great time to flirt. And then when the day comes, you can check in and be like, do I feel like flirting with anyone? And if the answer is no, because I feel shitty about my body today, then you can be like, \u201cOkay, do I need to flirt with myself? Like, can I actually work with this energy?\u201d [Anna: yeah!] You know what I mean? And if the answer is like, \u201cYou know what I do, I wasn&#39;t going to go to this party, but maybe I will go to this party, cause some fucking nerd told me it was a good day to flirt and let&#39;s see what happens.\u201d And then you go and it&#39;s terrible. Cool. Okay. Good information. Or you go, you go, and it&#39;s like, actually you flirt with someone. Great. You&#39;re getting information that you can use. And if it&#39;s not useful, don&#39;t use it. And if it is useful do use it. So again, I guess I keep on coming back to pragmatism. Faith will organically bloom when you feel safe. Yeah.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah. I think it&#39;s so funny because I really have been craving the ability to give myself to the woo, to turn that off that part of my brain. And this is very validating and this is going to help me, like, lean into the woo, by not trying to give myself to the woo.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: That&#39;s it. It&#39;s like, it&#39;s about accepting your nature. You&#39;re a critical thinker. You&#39;re somebody who&#39;s questioning things. Don&#39;t give that up to have faith. Bring that in. You know, and I think this is like, this is like, you&#39;ve just kind of gotten to this core thing of, if you have to give up your essential nature in order to do something, maybe it&#39;s not for you. And maybe it is, maybe it&#39;s the challenge you need, but why not enter into everything with critical thinking?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Man, yeah no, literally on that note, I think, I think that really sums up everything we hope to get at and didn&#39;t know we would be getting at.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jessica: That&#39;s so exciting, that\u2019s so exciting. Well, this has been a true joy for me so I thank you.</p><br/><p><br>Anna Borges: Little did I know when I set out to do an episode about embracing the woo that I was really doing an episode on \u2026 <em>embracing myself</em>.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Okay. But seriously, I, I do want to bottle Jessica\u2019s last answer for us and apply it to just about \u2026 everything. The idea that we shouldn\u2019t force ourselves to do things that don\u2019t work for us feels really simple, like I know, but how often do you find yourself doing it anyway? Like especially when it comes to taking care of our mental health.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>We try to turn ourselves into morning people, or people who meditate, or people who follow specific routines\u2014and when that stuff doesn\u2019t work? Ugh, I mean, I don\u2019t know about you, but my first question is always, \u201cWhat is wrong with me and how can I change?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>As for all the woo, I really love how Jessica highlighted how we can use it as a tool for, you know, intentional self-care and self-compassion, like that kind of stuff we talk about on the show all the time. Think of the party example that she gave\u2014the point was not whether or not the planets know for sure that it\u2019s a good time to flirt. Sometimes it\u2019s simply about creating an opportunity to open ourselves up to a new experience, like going to the party or thinking intentionally about what we want, or treating ourselves with kindness and love, like flirting with ourselves.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And I think the same can be said for so many mental health tools, right?

It is time for an astrology episode. Because let\u2019s be honest, I wasn\u2019t going to make it through a season of Mood Ring without one. But also because I think a lot of us could really use it right now.\n\n\u00a0\nDRONING MUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nJessica Lanyadoo: People turned to astrology for lots of reasons. A big common reason\u2014especially during this global pandemic and time of social unrest\u2014is anxiety. If I'm looking for a way to not feel anxious and an astrologer rattles off a ton of stuff and a ton of advice, in a way, in the short term, it's scratching that itch. I want order, I want to be told what's real. I want to be told what to do. Okay. This person's telling me. This person seems to have a grasp on the, on the universe and they're telling me what to do this week.\n\n\u00a0\nTHEME MUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings \u2026 and sometimes, if I\u2019m being honest with you guys, I do wonder if being TOO practical can hold us back.\n\n\u00a0\nYou just heard Jessica Lanyadoo, an astrologer, psychic medium, and today\u2019s guest. I invited her on because I love astrology as a self-care tool and definitely wanted to talk about it, but, at the same time I\u2019ve always felt like there was something kind of holding me back from really getting the most out of it.\n\n\u00a0\nBecause on the one hand, I feel exactly what you just heard Jessica describing. I want to be told what to do. I want to be told what\u2019s real. I want to believe my horoscope when it tells me how I can find happiness and trust when a meme tells me that my Leo Venus means you know, I\u2019m really good at love.\n\n\u00a0\nBut on the other hand, my skeptical little Virgo brain is like, \u201cUhhh. You don\u2019t actually believe in this, do you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nSo, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about today\u2014how we can turn down the volume on our logic and our doubt to really lean into, well as Jessica calls it, \u201cthe woo.\u201d Jessica herself specializes in helping people cultivate self-understanding and emotional intelligence through what she refers to as \u2026 woo. And I am ready to embrace the woo!\n\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re sitting here thinking, \u201cCan\u2019t relate, fuck astrology,\u201d this doesn\u2019t just apply to that. You know, you might have another complicated relationship between something you doubt the effectiveness of, or the truth of, but that you really kind of want to believe in. Our brains reject everything from the magic of meditation to our own self-worth\u2014like haven\u2019t you ever stopped to wonder, like \u201cHey, what would happen if I just trusted the process? Like, would I start to believe in it? Would it work?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nSo, that\u2019s what I wanted to talk to Jessica about. Why it\u2019s so hard to embrace the woo, and how we can.\n\n\u00a0\nMUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I feel like the question that comes up whenever people talk about astrology is, do you really believe in it? Like, I hear that all the time, whenever I express an interest and I'm curious: A, I mean, do you and B, what's your reaction to it?\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: Hmm. I don't believe in astrology. [Anna: gasps, whispers \u201camazing\u201d] I don't believe in astrology, and I don't believe in ibuprofen and I don't believe in the internet. I use them because they work. And that's how I respond to people asking me about it. And it's also how I respond to people being like, I don't believe in astrology. I say, cool. Yeah, me neither.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: You\u2019re like no, yeah, me neither.\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: It's a tool, it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a system and a tool. And I think, I should just pull back to say, when someone asks me about astrology, I don't think about memes. I don't think about apps. I don't think about AI. I don't think about sun signs. I don't think about compatibility and I don't think about stereotypes. Or like, \u201cI would never date a \u2014\u2014\u2014,\u201d to me none of that is astrology, That's like pop culture around astrology.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: That's like a good response and I'm gonna steal it. Like, what do you think people are really asking when they ask, do you believe in it? Like what's real, what's beneath that question?\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: It depends on who's asking. A lot of the times people have asked me that question, what they're really saying is, \u201cI went to university. I'm really smart. I don't want you to think I'm not smart. And, I just think it's fun.\u201d But usually they're trying to affirm their intellectual prowess and competency as a person and that is what they mean, I think, yeah.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: But like the reason that I start with the question of like people asking, do you believe in it is because my little gremlin brain asks that all the time. Like every time I kind of wanna like shut up and enjoy and like lean into it as a tool, in the back of my head there's like a little voice going, \u201cIs this even real? Like, what's the point of doing this?\u201d [Jessica: yep] So every time I wanna give myself to the woo, embrace the woo, logic gets in the way!\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: I, first of all, really like reclaiming words that are used to minimize or, like, belittle. So, you know, not so much anymore, it's 2022, but in the nineties I was dyke-identified because you're not gonna call me a dyke and get me, get me mad. I'm going to call me a dyke and enjoy it. And woo is something like, oh, that's, woo-woo, that's like, you know, a way of being dismissive. And so I'm really big on embracing it. So that's one part of it. But in terms of like, what I think woo is, I think it's a really big umbrella of \u2026 esoteric spiritualities that are not necessarily part of any kind of religion. I think they can be associated with like new age stuff. But even like, I don't even know what new age exactly means. It's woo. I can say astrologer, psychic medium, animal communicator, tarot reader, but that just feels like a lot of fucking words to confuse a person with. So woo. It just really kind of works.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Absolutely. Yeah. I, I connect with that so much, and then have like, kind of the underlayer of knowing that I probably lean on it to signal to other people who might judge, if I said astrology or tarot or whatever that like, \u201cDon't worry. I don't take it too seriously. I know it's woo.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: And think like, this is, this is like, I'm glad you said that because this thing of \u2026 there's so much judgment, especially towards women, or, women and femme people for being into things that are not quote \u201cproven.\u201d But I can use astrology to tell a person when a thing happened in their past, when a thing\u2019s going to happen in their future. I was able to see an airborne pandemic coming in 2020 through astrology. There's no religion that gives any kind of like \u2026 evidence. Right? Because people do attribute astrology to faith and it is spiritual, right? So it\u2019s, it's just really an interesting thing to me that people have to distance themselves to prove their intelligence. When in fact studying astrology takes years, it means learning a new language and there's a lot of math. But most people don't know that.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: This is why I can never fully embrace the woo! Math.\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: Math is hard! It\u2019s not a joke.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Math is hard! [laughs] I'm really glad that you mentioned like faith so early on, because when I was like getting ready for this interview and this episode, I did realize that it's like, not so much about astrology as it is, \u201cHow do I develop a sense of faith that I can trust? The same way that I'm not great at trusting my gut or trusting all of these things\u201d \u2018Cause I think so many of us second guess anything that we can't point at and be like, \u201cFactual. Valid. Cool.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: Yes. Agreed. Well, you know, I'm one of those people, I don't have faith, easily or frequently, but I, I'm a fan of evidence. And so for me, I think a lot of people are surprised because I'm a psychic medium and an animal communicator and astrologer, people assume that I believe in the things I do. I don't. And people who assume that I am a faith-based person. I\u2019m not. I would like to be more, honestly. And also I love evidence, and I don't think there's anything wrong with requiring evidence of the things that guide our lives and guide our choices. But, but like to answer your question in a way that's, I think, slightly more helpful, is \u2026 it is hard to have faith in others or in, or in, other things, when we don\u2019t have faith in ourselves and we don\u2019t know how to listen to ourselves-\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Ugh!\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: I'm sorry!\n\n\u00a0\n[Anna and Jessica laugh]\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I mean it\u2019s true, but you don\u2019t have to say it, Jessica!\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: I know, I know. It was like I slapped you. You were like, ouch! I\u2019m so sorry. But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what it is, is like. If you give strangers on the internet\u2014or like, whatever people, your mom, your ex\u2014power over your self esteem and your identity, like if we have that habit to do that with others, then we're really likely to do it with like faith-based things. And it is a, kind of a survival mechanism to say, \u201cI'm not going to believe in things if I don't know how to assess whether or not they're accurate. And if I make a mistake, I don't know how to take care of myself around that mistake.\u201d That's the key.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: There\u2019s like risk in trusting your faith or having faith.\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: Yes. The risk is that you're going to be wrong. That you're gonna be silly, that you're going to be dumb. That risk is that you, you know, you will lose yourself. You will give away your power. There's so many things that people can do in the name of faith. I mean, I think it's wise to have a critical relationship with where we give our faith, with what we believe in, and the tools that we use.\n\nTHEME MUSIC\n\nAnna Borges: Well. Wow. Jessica just pretty much summed up exactly what\u2019s so scary about giving ourselves over to the woo, huh? It takes a lot of self-trust to let go and that can be really terrifying for many of us\u2014or I mean, at least a lot scarier than staying in control.\n\nAfter the break, we\u2019ll talk about how to get over that\u2014but, like, in a way that\u2019s actually true to you, I promise.\n\n\nMIDROLL\n\n\u00a0\nTHEME MUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Hey all, welcome back to Mood Ring. We\u2019ve been talking with astrology and psychic Jessica Lanyado. We started with why it can be so hard to embrace the woo\u2014so now let\u2019s dive into how.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAnd trust me, the irony is not lost on me that even in an episode about woo and rejecting the practicalities that hold us back from woo, I still couldn\u2019t resist the urge to ask Jessica for practical answers. But honestly, I\u2019m glad I did. The rest of our conversation really didn\u2019t go as expected for me\u2014and I may or may not have left with an entirely new perspective. Let\u2019s dive back in.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Do you have, like, any guidance for how people who are kind of in this push and pull relationship with like belief, faith, whatever we want to call it, but want to be able to fully lean in or start leaning in? Like where do we start embracing the woo?\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: That's really good question. Let me think for a second here, because\u2014let me tell you why I'm like pausing to think. Because it does depend a little. Some people don't embrace the woo because they have a hard time being in emotion. [Anna: yeah] And some people have a hard time not identifying first and foremost with their intellect. And those are very different problems. And they look kind of the same on the surface, but they're very different issues and they take different remediation. I also think some people have religious damage and are scared of believing in anything because their belief was turned against them. And I think it ultimately really just does come back to figuring out how to trust yourself [Anna: yeah] And how to use tools\u2014and I would say in this context, belief is a tool\u2014as a way to make your life better and to identify whether or not it's actually not making your life better.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I love that, so like what does tapping into their intuition and deciding what to do with that information look like? Because I know that it's like, some people are more prescriptive than others, you know, like some astrologers I like, but sometimes it's very vague, like the planets are doing this and that means it might be a good time to do that or whatever. And it's, what do we do? What do we do with that? What is it like, I'm like, sure. And then I forget the next day.\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: Yeah. Yeah. So I am a fan of taking notes. If something seems important that you're reading or hearing or seeing a \u201cwoo\u201d say, I think it's important to jot it down and to then sit with like, okay, this person has said it's a great time to flirt. And then when the day comes, you can check in and be like, do I feel like flirting with anyone? And if the answer is no, because I feel shitty about my body today, then you can be like, \u201cOkay, do I need to flirt with myself? Like, can I actually work with this energy?\u201d [Anna: yeah!] You know what I mean? And if the answer is like, \u201cYou know what I do, I wasn't going to go to this party, but maybe I will go to this party, cause some fucking nerd told me it was a good day to flirt and let's see what happens.\u201d And then you go and it's terrible. Cool. Okay. Good information. Or you go, you go, and it's like, actually you flirt with someone. Great. You're getting information that you can use. And if it's not useful, don't use it. And if it is useful do use it. So again, I guess I keep on coming back to pragmatism. Faith will organically bloom when you feel safe. Yeah.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Yeah. I think it's so funny because I really have been craving the ability to give myself to the woo, to turn that off that part of my brain. And this is very validating and this is going to help me, like, lean into the woo, by not trying to give myself to the woo.\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: That's it. It's like, it's about accepting your nature. You're a critical thinker. You're somebody who's questioning things. Don't give that up to have faith. Bring that in. You know, and I think this is like, this is like, you've just kind of gotten to this core thing of, if you have to give up your essential nature in order to do something, maybe it's not for you. And maybe it is, maybe it's the challenge you need, but why not enter into everything with critical thinking?\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Man, yeah no, literally on that note, I think, I think that really sums up everything we hope to get at and didn't know we would be getting at.\n\n\u00a0\nJessica: That's so exciting, that\u2019s so exciting. Well, this has been a true joy for me so I thank you.\n\nAnna Borges: Little did I know when I set out to do an episode about embracing the woo that I was really doing an episode on \u2026 embracing myself.\n\n\u00a0\nOkay. But seriously, I, I do want to bottle Jessica\u2019s last answer for us and apply it to just about \u2026 everything. The idea that we shouldn\u2019t force ourselves to do things that don\u2019t work for us feels really simple, like I know, but how often do you find yourself doing it anyway? Like especially when it comes to taking care of our mental health.\n\n\u00a0\nWe try to turn ourselves into morning people, or people who meditate, or people who follow specific routines\u2014and when that stuff doesn\u2019t work? Ugh, I mean, I don\u2019t know about you, but my first question is always, \u201cWhat is wrong with me and how can I change?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nAs for all the woo, I really love how Jessica highlighted how we can use it as a tool for, you know, intentional self-care and self-compassion, like that kind of stuff we talk about on the show all the time. Think of the party example that she gave\u2014the point was not whether or not the planets know for sure that it\u2019s a good time to flirt. Sometimes it\u2019s simply about creating an opportunity to open ourselves up to a new experience, like going to the party or thinking intentionally about what we want, or treating ourselves with kindness and love, like flirting with ourselves.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd I think the same can be said for so many mental health tools, right? Like, at the end of the day, it\u2019s about understanding ourselves and making those tools available to us, work for us as we are. Which, hey, I am not saying that\u2019s easy by any means, but, at least with woo, it\u2019s a little bit more magical.\n\n\u00a0\nCREDITS",

If you&#39;ve been with us here since the beginning of Mood Ring \u2026 you may remember a work-related breakdown I had on the shower floor? Yeah, that was this job. So week after week, I would go back and forth debating about whether or not I wanted to quit without anything lined up for the sake of my mental health.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Because here was the thing: I could. I could do that. I grew up with a lot of financial instability, so savings has always been really important to me. And by that point in my life, I was in a privileged enough position that I could afford unemployment for a couple of months if I wiped out my savings.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But, I just couldn&#39;t get myself to do it. Like, sure, yeah money could buy me freedom from a job that was making me cry every time I woke up and faced the thought of yet another day. But money was also buying my health insurance and rent and security and peace of mind and all of the things that I needed to buy in my life. And, I mean, I\u2019d experienced what it was like before without a financial safety net. And I didn\u2019t know what would be worse, like all the feelings I was dealing with at this job, or all the feelings that came with losing that security?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Which is all to say, oh my god, there are a lot of feelings to be had around money. The stress of the things we do to make it. The decisions we have to make about spending it. The shame of having it, the guilt of not having it. The attitudes we\u2019ve adopted about it or inherited.\u00a0 I mean, grappling with privilege or changing financial circumstances. Just overall how money, or lack thereof, can make us feel vulnerable. Or judged. Or obligated. Or a million other emotions.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I know that\u2019s something I say a lot on this show: things make us feel emotions.

So how much was money really helping my mental health?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I mean, a lot. A lot. Money helps my mental health a lot, and it would be bullshit to pretend otherwise.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s still not that simple.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings\u2014both the feelings you can put a price on and the feelings you can\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Every episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope \u2014 with our feelings, with our baggage, with our money baggage, with our brains, and with the world around us.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Today, we\u2019re talking about money and how sometimes it can buy\u2014maybe, not happiness, exactly, but a whole lot of stuff that supports our mental health. Like, not just in big ways, like access to mental health care and being able to meet our fundamental needs, but also in small ways. You know, like, the ability to buy things like time, energy, and support in the form of things like\u2026child care and meal delivery and time off work and all of these little things that support our ability to feel, like, slightly more well.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>We wanted to tackle this topic by hearing from you about your relationship with money and kind of the connection between money and mental health and how you experience it. And your responses, you know, made the heart of the episode super clear, and it\u2019s that unpacking our relationships with money and all our feelings about it is key to understanding the role it plays in our mental health. For better AND for worse.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Maybe you\u2019ll recognize yourself in some of today\u2019s stories, and maybe you won\u2019t, but the point is to get to know your own story. You know, because this shit is complicated, and we have to meet ourselves where we\u2019re at with lots of compassion.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Alright, so without further ado I just want to dive right into some of the stories we got from our listeners.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Kevin: My mismanagement of money has gotten me in a heap of trouble at home with my spouse. Spending beyond my means and really had to curb the amount of dumb shit that I buy, which has been helpful because I\u2019m able to talk myself out of making purchases now and say, \u201cYou know what? That\u2019s not going to help me. That\u2019s not going to make me feel less depressed or less terrible. So I don\u2019t need to do it.\u201d And yeah, when you don\u2019t have a lot of money it\u2019s fucking stressful. Because you\u2019re worried about how you\u2019re going to make it to the next paycheck. You worry about spending your money on the wrong things. You worry about just like having enough to take care of an emergency if something comes up. Yeah, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s rough when you\u2019re already struggling enough as it is, tossing in thinking about finances and how poorly you handle them and poor decisions that you make and how people are disappointed with you when you piss away your money on dumb shit. That doesn\u2019t make you feel any better. It makes you feel a lot worse and that\u2019s, that is a one-way ticket to couples therapy.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Okay, raise your hand if our listener Kevin just echoed your internal monologue. We can judge ourselves SO harshly for how we spend our money\u2014even if we\u2019re doing it in the name of just trying to feel better.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>At the same time, feelings hold information\u2014and like Kevin and our next listener Ronald point out, sometimes they can help us figure out whether or not money is actually doing what we want it to do.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Ronald: I don\u2019t know if, you know, ordering food on UberEats makes me happy. I don\u2019t think it makes me happy. It makes me like satiated, for sure, but I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know if participating in a system that is exploitative is necessarily nourishing for people either.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I don\u2019t know that anyone really knows that. I mean I don\u2019t! How do we even begin to untangle all the ways self-care has gotten wrapped up with consumerism, and all of the sticky, tricky ethical and human questions that come with it?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>A similar theme that came up a lot? Guilt related to our financial circumstances.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Harper: I have immense financial anxiety that is disproportionate to my circumstances. And I have a lot of I guess like financial survivor\u2019s guilt about that. About the fact that I have all these resources and yet I still feel so unsafe and I feel so guilty that I have this much when others do not. I also have a lot of child of immigrants\u2019 guilt around it because my family came from so little, they gave me so much. And whenever I am unable to succeed it feels like I am failing multiple generations. When I was a kid a hate crime happened to my family and we were able to move and that was because of the way that my parents had made their financial choices and the financial standing that they were in, that they were able to do that. So that\u2019s just really emblematic, I guess, of what money has meant to my family. When I, when I got laid off from my first job, I had had a lot of money saved because saving was always really important to me, and I felt really confident because I also had a really great resume full of great internships and good experience and I felt like it would be a couple of months and then I\u2019d be fine. And then that ended up not being the case and thus began the major financial trauma of my life which is that I had spent several years after that being unemployed, underemployed or fully employed at places that were really abusive. And so I burned through all of my savings and then I had to rely on my parents after that. I felt like \u201cwow, there is no amount of money that I can save that will ever keep me safe.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Anna: Like I said at the top of the episode, that point about safety is so important for me, too, and for so many of us. And when we start to feel like no amount of money will keep us safe, what are we supposed to do with that?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I mean, I wish we had answers, but in talking to people in our circles and hearing from our listeners, sometimes we have no choice but to just kind of\u2026keep on trying to make it work the best we can.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Ronald: You know I am the child of immigrants. My parents kind of came here via the Refugee Act of 1980. And I think for a lot of those immigrants you kind of navigate poverty the best way you can, usually by like leaning on the community that you \u2026 you\u2019re living in and your fellow immigrants and then you find a way to kind of straddle, class straddle into the middle class. And that, you know. My mom is a CNA at a nursing home. And I would say, you know, my aunt works in the medical field. My dad was a respiratory therapist. And so, you know, you kind of do what you can to survive and then you find a very steady work where you\u2019re usually like \u2026 taking care of dying rich people.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Harper: I feel like all I\u2019ve ever wanted to be able to do is three things: I wanted to have enough money to be safe, I wanted to have enough money to have a decent margin of error for when I made the wrong choice, not just for when circumstances screwed me over, and I\u2019ve always wanted to have enough money to be able to be generous. That\u2019s really all I want, and I have been able to do those things at different points in my life, but I really don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ll ever have enough to truly be safe. And that scares me.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: That scares me, too. A lot. I feel like these days, I can\u2019t open Twitter or talk to my friends or anything without hearing jokes about the shitty existence under late stage capitalism\u2014and those jokes are funny, but beneath those jokes, beneath all of them, all I hear is genuine fear that money won\u2019t ever NOT define our lives. Whether it\u2019s not being able to afford your basic needs or staying in shitty jobs so we can, it\u2019s hard not to feel like money is the one thing standing between us and any number of fates. And that\u2019s scary\u2014and also not a very satisfying solution, especially when we\u2019re usually here to talk about dealing with feelings like fear.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But, I mean, if it were that easy to reach a satisfying conclusion about money and mental health, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation I guess. Which, yeah okay, not exactly a comfort, but I did promise that we wouldn\u2019t try to find easy answers on Mood Ring, so here we are.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Thank you to listeners and friends of the show Kevin, Harper and Ronald for sharing their stories with us for this episode. Like, we know this is some vulnerable shit and we really appreciate it every time you guys share your stories with us so thank you again.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>After the break, we\u2019ll chat with Mood Ring producer Jordan Kauwling about money and a recent major life decision.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. I\u2019m Anna Borges. Before the break we were listening to messages from YOU about the impact that money has had on your own lives.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Next up, is a conversation I had with my producer Jordan Kauwling, and I have some kind of sad news and by kind of I mean very, which that this was actually the last episode that Jordan and I were working on together. Jordan is moving on from Mood Ring and she is going to be so dearly missed for a million reasons that I will not begin to enumerate because then this episode will get very, very off topic, but she has been such an asset to the show and it just so happened to line up that this last episode that we were doing together was a topic that was really really close to Jordan\u2019s heart and my heart, and it just seemed like the perfect opportunity to sit down and talk money trauma together. So I\u2019m just going to let the conversation speak for itself.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: When we were developing this episode, I know that it was one that really resonated with you, Jordan. And it also happens to be your last episode. So it does feel perfect in a way for us to have this conversation, but it&#39;s also a little bittersweet.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jordan: Yeah, it&#39;s definitely bittersweet. When we had our production meetings and we decided we wanted to do an episode about money, I immediately felt something in my spirit stand up and say, this is an episode that is meant for you to be a part of. So I&#39;m so glad that we&#39;re able to have this conversation today.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: And I know so much of your connection to this topic, like at this time and space in the world is related to you going on sabbatical soon. And I, I&#39;m curious actually, cause I feel like we figured out this episode a while ago, did you know at the time, or was it just general money stuff that made your spirit sit up?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jordan: When we were having this production, this pre-production meeting about money, I was thinking about my godmother. My godmother, I reconnected with her in 2019 \u2026 right before the pandemic when I moved back to LA. She lives, she lived in Santa Monica and she unfortunately passed away from cancer in 2020. And so when we decided we were gonna do this episode about money, all I could think about was my godmother, this woman who had worked her entire life to work herself out of poverty and who died penniless. And then it made me reflect on my own life, my own path that I had been on of overwork throughout the pandemic. But to answer your question at the time that we had this meeting, I had no idea that I was gonna need to, that I was gonna need to take a break.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: So would you mind sharing kind of how, I mean you had that realization that you needed a break?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jordan: Yeah, sure. I, I feel like my body was slowly letting me know that it was time for me to, to take a break. My godmother passing away at the height of the pandemic in 2020, not being able to say goodbye to her other than via Zoom, having to have an outdoor funeral, really instead of taking what happened to my godmother as a message and reflecting on it, that I needed to take a pause in my life, that I needed to stop working so hard and overworking myself. I took it as a message that I needed to work even harder because I never wanted to end up in a similar situation as her. I took, so I, I started working even harder, to the detriment of my own emotional, mental and, and, and physical health. Because again with the pandemic, so many of us were out of work. I felt so much guilt because I was one of the few people in my friend&#39;s circle. And in my family circle, who was able to work from home, who was able to continue to work full time and to bring in an income. And so many people around me were not able to do so.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jordan: So I took on the responsibility of helping people pay utility bills. Helping people pay tax bills, helping people, you know, buy groceries. And so, because I felt like I was privileged enough to continue to work, it pushed me to work even harder until I reached a point where I physically could not work any harder. I emotionally could not work any harder. And I started longing for vacation time. And I realized that, in my life, I&#39;ve never gone on a vacation. So I started researching, you know, if I were to go on a vacation, where would I go? And I, I fell down this YouTube rabbit hole that eventually led me to the idea of what if you took an extended vacation, and what if that vacation was, you know, not just two or three days or a week&#39;s time, what if it was something that was, was restorative to all of the things that have been stripped from you in the past few years?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: The story of your aunt, even though, like I&#39;ve not had an experience like it, feels so familiar to me because so much of my drive to make money is like avoiding a certain fate that I&#39;ve witnessed, you know? And like, we don&#39;t bring in stuff such as like work life balance and actual like wellness into that conversation. All I knew is I wanted to avoid my parents&#39; financial fate, that&#39;s it. Not like I wanna avoid my parents&#39; financial fate and also be like a human who is well and doesn&#39;t wanna die. I was just so concerned with the money aspect of it, even through our conversation and listening to, to our listeners who were, who were speaking to this as well, is how much of like, can money buy happiness? When I think like, hell yet can, like, what I&#39;m really thinking is like money can like buy me out of one specific type of unhappiness. But I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve really considered holistically what money is doing for my mental health.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jordan: I&#39;ve, I\u2019ve come to a place hopefully of peace or of better peace with money. Money can buy happiness. It can buy, buy me time. Hell it can buy my mom a new house, hopefully one day. But you know, money is like water. It flows in and it flows out. But if you&#39;re not careful, it can, can drown you. So\u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Holy shit, Jordan! Where did that come from?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jordan: I don\u2019t know! [laughs]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Clearly there\u2019s no easy answer here. I mean, there isn\u2019t even a simple question that we were asking. But we knew all that going in.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And I think what stood out to me between Jordan\u2019s story, my own story, the stories that we got from Ronald and Harper and Kevin, is we can put so much hope into money. Like, so many expectations on it. And in some ways that\u2019s totally right! Money does in a lot of ways bolster our ability to take care of ourselves on a very fundamental level. And we also look to it for security or to avoid a certain fate or to buy things that can ease the burden of life\u2019s everyday bullshit. But, I think what\u2019s standing out is it can be hard to predict like whether it\u2019ll actually do what we need it to do or if it will just cause more problems, literally or emotionally.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Digging into all of the like personal nuances of using money to address mental health is complicated, as we heard from all of you. And\u2026 I mean we can make 6 million episodes out of this. But it\u2019s a good place to start, you know, like we can unpack our money baggage. We can reflect on the underlying needs that we\u2019re trying to address with money and whether money can actually address those needs. Because sometimes, that can lead us to say, \u201cYou know? Actually, I won\u2019t get what I need from this,\u201d and then we can use it as an opportunity to find something else. Like something better.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But at the same time what do we do when the answer is, \u201cYeah, money would really help here\u201d and we don\u2019t have it? Or our feelings or our histories interfere with our ability to accept that help or use it in that way?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I guess that\u2019s when we find ways to soothe and manage the feelings that come with that. And share our stories so we don\u2019t think that we\u2019re alone in them. And short of that, I\u2019m really holding out on marrying rich.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>If you have more thoughts to share on money and mental health, you know we always want to hear from you. Just because the theme of the day is over doesn\u2019t mean your stories are over.\u00a0 So tag me or the show on social, call our toll-free number and leave a message, submit through our website.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And in the meantime, I hope you treat yourself to something nice\u2014whether that\u2019s self-compassion or a small purchase that will give you the hit of dopamine when you need it. You know, whichever works.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>CREDITS</p>\n      ",

For better AND for worse.\n\n\u00a0\nMaybe you\u2019ll recognize yourself in some of today\u2019s stories, and maybe you won\u2019t, but the point is to get to know your own story. You know, because this shit is complicated, and we have to meet ourselves where we\u2019re at with lots of compassion.\n\n\u00a0\nAlright, so without further ado I just want to dive right into some of the stories we got from our listeners.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nKevin: My mismanagement of money has gotten me in a heap of trouble at home with my spouse. Spending beyond my means and really had to curb the amount of dumb shit that I buy, which has been helpful because I\u2019m able to talk myself out of making purchases now and say, \u201cYou know what? That\u2019s not going to help me. That\u2019s not going to make me feel less depressed or less terrible. So I don\u2019t need to do it.\u201d And yeah, when you don\u2019t have a lot of money it\u2019s fucking stressful. Because you\u2019re worried about how you\u2019re going to make it to the next paycheck. You worry about spending your money on the wrong things. You worry about just like having enough to take care of an emergency if something comes up. Yeah, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s rough when you\u2019re already struggling enough as it is, tossing in thinking about finances and how poorly you handle them and poor decisions that you make and how people are disappointed with you when you piss away your money on dumb shit. That doesn\u2019t make you feel any better. It makes you feel a lot worse and that\u2019s, that is a one-way ticket to couples therapy.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Okay, raise your hand if our listener Kevin just echoed your internal monologue. We can judge ourselves SO harshly for how we spend our money\u2014even if we\u2019re doing it in the name of just trying to feel better.\n\n\u00a0\nAt the same time, feelings hold information\u2014and like Kevin and our next listener Ronald point out, sometimes they can help us figure out whether or not money is actually doing what we want it to do.\n\n\u00a0\nRonald: I don\u2019t know if, you know, ordering food on UberEats makes me happy. I don\u2019t think it makes me happy. It makes me like satiated, for sure, but I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know if participating in a system that is exploitative is necessarily nourishing for people either.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I don\u2019t know that anyone really knows that. I mean I don\u2019t! How do we even begin to untangle all the ways self-care has gotten wrapped up with consumerism, and all of the sticky, tricky ethical and human questions that come with it?\n\n\u00a0\nA similar theme that came up a lot? Guilt related to our financial circumstances.\n\n\u00a0\nHarper: I have immense financial anxiety that is disproportionate to my circumstances. And I have a lot of I guess like financial survivor\u2019s guilt about that. About the fact that I have all these resources and yet I still feel so unsafe and I feel so guilty that I have this much when others do not. I also have a lot of child of immigrants\u2019 guilt around it because my family came from so little, they gave me so much. And whenever I am unable to succeed it feels like I am failing multiple generations. When I was a kid a hate crime happened to my family and we were able to move and that was because of the way that my parents had made their financial choices and the financial standing that they were in, that they were able to do that. So that\u2019s just really emblematic, I guess, of what money has meant to my family. When I, when I got laid off from my first job, I had had a lot of money saved because saving was always really important to me, and I felt really confident because I also had a really great resume full of great internships and good experience and I felt like it would be a couple of months and then I\u2019d be fine. And then that ended up not being the case and thus began the major financial trauma of my life which is that I had spent several years after that being unemployed, underemployed or fully employed at places that were really abusive. And so I burned through all of my savings and then I had to rely on my parents after that. I felt like \u201cwow, there is no amount of money that I can save that will ever keep me safe.\u201d\n\n\nAnna: Like I said at the top of the episode, that point about safety is so important for me, too, and for so many of us. And when we start to feel like no amount of money will keep us safe, what are we supposed to do with that?\n\n\u00a0\nI mean, I wish we had answers, but in talking to people in our circles and hearing from our listeners, sometimes we have no choice but to just kind of\u2026keep on trying to make it work the best we can.\n\n\u00a0\nRonald: You know I am the child of immigrants. My parents kind of came here via the Refugee Act of 1980. And I think for a lot of those immigrants you kind of navigate poverty the best way you can, usually by like leaning on the community that you \u2026 you\u2019re living in and your fellow immigrants and then you find a way to kind of straddle, class straddle into the middle class. And that, you know. My mom is a CNA at a nursing home. And I would say, you know, my aunt works in the medical field. My dad was a respiratory therapist. And so, you know, you kind of do what you can to survive and then you find a very steady work where you\u2019re usually like \u2026 taking care of dying rich people.\n\n\u00a0\nHarper: I feel like all I\u2019ve ever wanted to be able to do is three things: I wanted to have enough money to be safe, I wanted to have enough money to have a decent margin of error for when I made the wrong choice, not just for when circumstances screwed me over, and I\u2019ve always wanted to have enough money to be able to be generous. That\u2019s really all I want, and I have been able to do those things at different points in my life, but I really don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ll ever have enough to truly be safe. And that scares me.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: That scares me, too. A lot. I feel like these days, I can\u2019t open Twitter or talk to my friends or anything without hearing jokes about the shitty existence under late stage capitalism\u2014and those jokes are funny, but beneath those jokes, beneath all of them, all I hear is genuine fear that money won\u2019t ever NOT define our lives. Whether it\u2019s not being able to afford your basic needs or staying in shitty jobs so we can, it\u2019s hard not to feel like money is the one thing standing between us and any number of fates. And that\u2019s scary\u2014and also not a very satisfying solution, especially when we\u2019re usually here to talk about dealing with feelings like fear.\n\n\u00a0\nBut, I mean, if it were that easy to reach a satisfying conclusion about money and mental health, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation I guess. Which, yeah okay, not exactly a comfort, but I did promise that we wouldn\u2019t try to find easy answers on Mood Ring, so here we are.\n\n\u00a0\nThank you to listeners and friends of the show Kevin, Harper and Ronald for sharing their stories with us for this episode. Like, we know this is some vulnerable shit and we really appreciate it every time you guys share your stories with us so thank you again.\n\n\u00a0\nAfter the break, we\u2019ll chat with Mood Ring producer Jordan Kauwling about money and a recent major life decision.\n\n\u00a0\nMIDROLL\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. I\u2019m Anna Borges. Before the break we were listening to messages from YOU about the impact that money has had on your own lives.\n\n\u00a0\nNext up, is a conversation I had with my producer Jordan Kauwling, and I have some kind of sad news and by kind of I mean very, which that this was actually the last episode that Jordan and I were working on together. Jordan is moving on from Mood Ring and she is going to be so dearly missed for a million reasons that I will not begin to enumerate because then this episode will get very, very off topic, but she has been such an asset to the show and it just so happened to line up that this last episode that we were doing together was a topic that was really really close to Jordan\u2019s heart and my heart, and it just seemed like the perfect opportunity to sit down and talk money trauma together. So I\u2019m just going to let the conversation speak for itself.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: When we were developing this episode, I know that it was one that really resonated with you, Jordan. And it also happens to be your last episode. So it does feel perfect in a way for us to have this conversation, but it's also a little bittersweet.\n\n\u00a0\nJordan: Yeah, it's definitely bittersweet. When we had our production meetings and we decided we wanted to do an episode about money, I immediately felt something in my spirit stand up and say, this is an episode that is meant for you to be a part of. So I'm so glad that we're able to have this conversation today.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: And I know so much of your connection to this topic, like at this time and space in the world is related to you going on sabbatical soon. And I, I'm curious actually, cause I feel like we figured out this episode a while ago, did you know at the time, or was it just general money stuff that made your spirit sit up?\n\n\u00a0\nJordan: When we were having this production, this pre-production meeting about money, I was thinking about my godmother. My godmother, I reconnected with her in 2019 \u2026 right before the pandemic when I moved back to LA. She lives, she lived in Santa Monica and she unfortunately passed away from cancer in 2020. And so when we decided we were gonna do this episode about money, all I could think about was my godmother, this woman who had worked her entire life to work herself out of poverty and who died penniless. And then it made me reflect on my own life, my own path that I had been on of overwork throughout the pandemic. But to answer your question at the time that we had this meeting, I had no idea that I was gonna need to, that I was gonna need to take a break.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: So would you mind sharing kind of how, I mean you had that realization that you needed a break?\n\n\u00a0\nJordan: Yeah, sure. I, I feel like my body was slowly letting me know that it was time for me to, to take a break. My godmother passing away at the height of the pandemic in 2020, not being able to say goodbye to her other than via Zoom, having to have an outdoor funeral, really instead of taking what happened to my godmother as a message and reflecting on it, that I needed to take a pause in my life, that I needed to stop working so hard and overworking myself. I took it as a message that I needed to work even harder because I never wanted to end up in a similar situation as her. I took, so I, I started working even harder, to the detriment of my own emotional, mental and, and, and physical health. Because again with the pandemic, so many of us were out of work. I felt so much guilt because I was one of the few people in my friend's circle. And in my family circle, who was able to work from home, who was able to continue to work full time and to bring in an income. And so many people around me were not able to do so.\n\n\u00a0\nJordan: So I took on the responsibility of helping people pay utility bills. Helping people pay tax bills, helping people, you know, buy groceries. And so, because I felt like I was privileged enough to continue to work, it pushed me to work even harder until I reached a point where I physically could not work any harder. I emotionally could not work any harder. And I started longing for vacation time. And I realized that, in my life, I've never gone on a vacation. So I started researching, you know, if I were to go on a vacation, where would I go? And I, I fell down this YouTube rabbit hole that eventually led me to the idea of what if you took an extended vacation, and what if that vacation was, you know, not just two or three days or a week's time, what if it was something that was, was restorative to all of the things that have been stripped from you in the past few years?\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: The story of your aunt, even though, like I've not had an experience like it, feels so familiar to me because so much of my drive to make money is like avoiding a certain fate that I've witnessed, you know? And like, we don't bring in stuff such as like work life balance and actual like wellness into that conversation. All I knew is I wanted to avoid my parents' financial fate, that's it. Not like I wanna avoid my parents' financial fate and also be like a human who is well and doesn't wanna die. I was just so concerned with the money aspect of it, even through our conversation and listening to, to our listeners who were, who were speaking to this as well, is how much of like, can money buy happiness? When I think like, hell yet can, like, what I'm really thinking is like money can like buy me out of one specific type of unhappiness. But I don't know that I've really considered holistically what money is doing for my mental health.\n\n\u00a0\nJordan: I've, I\u2019ve come to a place hopefully of peace or of better peace with money. Money can buy happiness. It can buy, buy me time. Hell it can buy my mom a new house, hopefully one day. But you know, money is like water. It flows in and it flows out. But if you're not careful, it can, can drown you. So\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Holy shit, Jordan! Where did that come from?\n\n\u00a0\nJordan: I don\u2019t know! [laughs]\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Clearly there\u2019s no easy answer here. I mean, there isn\u2019t even a simple question that we were asking. But we knew all that going in.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd I think what stood out to me between Jordan\u2019s story, my own story, the stories that we got from Ronald and Harper and Kevin, is we can put so much hope into money. Like, so many expectations on it. And in some ways that\u2019s totally right! Money does in a lot of ways bolster our ability to take care of ourselves on a very fundamental level. And we also look to it for security or to avoid a certain fate or to buy things that can ease the burden of life\u2019s everyday bullshit. But, I think what\u2019s standing out is it can be hard to predict like whether it\u2019ll actually do what we need it to do or if it will just cause more problems, literally or emotionally.\n\n\u00a0\nDigging into all of the like personal nuances of using money to address mental health is complicated, as we heard from all of you. And\u2026 I mean we can make 6 million episodes out of this. But it\u2019s a good place to start, you know, like we can unpack our money baggage. We can reflect on the underlying needs that we\u2019re trying to address with money and whether money can actually address those needs. Because sometimes, that can lead us to say, \u201cYou know? Actually, I won\u2019t get what I need from this,\u201d and then we can use it as an opportunity to find something else. Like something better.\n\n\u00a0\nBut at the same time what do we do when the answer is, \u201cYeah, money would really help here\u201d and we don\u2019t have it? Or our feelings or our histories interfere with our ability to accept that help or use it in that way?\n\n\u00a0\nI guess that\u2019s when we find ways to soothe and manage the feelings that come with that. And share our stories so we don\u2019t think that we\u2019re alone in them. And short of that, I\u2019m really holding out on marrying rich.\n\n\u00a0\nIf you have more thoughts to share on money and mental health, you know we always want to hear from you. Just because the theme of the day is over doesn\u2019t mean your stories are over.\u00a0 So tag me or the show on social, call our toll-free number and leave a message, submit through our website.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd in the meantime, I hope you treat yourself to something nice\u2014whether that\u2019s self-compassion or a small purchase that will give you the hit of dopamine when you need it. You know, whichever works.\n\n\u00a0\nTHEME MUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nCREDITS",

Our mental health. Specifically, laughing about our mental health by following accounts we find relatable and making it part of our regular social media diet.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Now to be clear, disclaimer up top, it\u2019s totally okay if jokes about mental health don\u2019t feel particularly funny to you. What makes us laugh is, you know, an extremely personal thing, especially where mental health is concerned. And far be it for me to try and tell people that they should find my tweets about wanting to die hilarious. It\u2019s not for everyone.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>All that said, I\u2019m really relieved that joking about mental health on social media is way more accepted than it used to be. Because now, all of my feeds are full of reminders that I\u2019m not alone, and they offer new ways to frame how I think about my struggles. And, I mean yeah,\u00a0 they make me laugh and laughing is great.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So let\u2019s dig into why following mental health accounts is, you know, a small way to show yourself some love. Joining me is Priscilla Eva, who runs one of my favorite mental health accounts, Memes to Discuss in Therapy. And when I say memes to discuss in therapy, I don\u2019t mean wholesome memes that would make my therapist proud. I mean memes that would make my therapist like start scribbling a lot of notes.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And by <em>that</em>, I mean total shitposts.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>You\u2019re good if you\u2019re not actually familiar with this whole mental health shitposting thing\u2014the main thing you need to know is that they\u2019re the kind of posts that probably seem inappropriate or insensitive or dark from the outside. But when you <em>are</em> in on the joke? It\u2019s kind of like finding shorthand for the experiences that you thought no one else understood.<br><br>So let\u2019s dive into my conversation with Priscilla.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MUSIC FADE OUT</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: I would love to start by hearing from you, just for people who aren&#39;t familiar with the page how you would describe it, just to like anchor, anchor our listeners into like, what the f we&#39;re talking about.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: It&#39;s just a meme shitposting page. And I like to say I specialize in curating and making memes for mental health and chronic illness. Because those are the two things I care about, mental health and chronic illness related things. And, those are the things that I find most resonant and like to share and repost or make memes of.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: So can you give me kind of the origin story of how you started this page, and like what led to it?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: So my friend Tyler, they actually started the page about five years ago. And they started it for the same reason, wanted to just basically shit post mental health stuff. [Anna laughs] And it started as a Facebook page that was just, you know, sharing with a few friends. And then they made it public. And so I started helping, about four or five years ago?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Oh, wow, I didn&#39;t realize the page had been alive for so long. I, I feel like a newcomer, like I&#39;m a poser. I&#39;m like, Oh, I&#39;ve been a long term fan of memes to discuss in therapy. And it&#39;s like, oh, no, no,</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: Our growth only really, I think took off \u2026 a little bit before the pandemic started. [Anna: hmmmm] And I think the pandemic did a lot for people, you know, realizing that they maybe had mental health stuff that they wanted to address for just a plethora of reasons.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: It\u2019s, it became more mainstream.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: Yes. And so then we got even more followers from that. And then, we started the Instagram, so we could cross post. And, that&#39;s kind of where we grew to where we are today.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: So before that, what was your relationship with social media like, or was that really when you dove full in?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: Actually always had, you know, sort of flirtation ship with social media. I&#39;ve had my SlyFox persona since high school, which was back in the MySpace days.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Same, same. I was a scene queen, you know, just being sad on the internet since 2004.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: Yeah, so I&#39;ve had my SlyFox persona since then. And I kind of use it as my, like, online posting alter ego.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: I feel often similarly when I talk about my mental health online. It&#39;s like there&#39;s how I talk about my mental health with my therapist and my friends, and then how I talk about it with it online and that difference there, but, it&#39;s not, so it sounds like you&#39;re someone who has always been comfortable on the internet in some way. Like an Internet person.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: Yeah, I, oh gosh. I was very into AIM back in the day, the instant messenger. Yes, and MySpace, all that. Had a lot of online friendships. So it&#39;s like people I actually know, which is parlayed into what a lot of my relationships are as an adult. There&#39;s a lot of people I know from school, college, you know. And now from, like, my chronic illness stuff, different walks of life. People I&#39;ve met in real life, but we usually only ever talk online because I have my chronic illness stuff like, you know, during the pandemic, since I&#39;m immunocompromised, couldn&#39;t go out at all. [Anna: yeah] So, that kind of compounded it. But there&#39;s a lot of relationships I have with people that it&#39;s, you know, just messaging each other back and forth a few times a week, sending each other memes. And I&#39;m surprised how similar it is to the AIM instant messages I was sending in high school.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: I am so glad that you said that, or so excited that you said that because literally, literally one of the things I was gonna, wanted to just share is that that is how it functions for me. Like my relationship to the memes, specifically, your page is one that I use a lot, is reposting them to stories kind of as an away message. You know, it used to be like emo song lyrics on my aim profile, and now it&#39;s like sad memes. And I just kind of like throw it out there to give people visibility into my sadness, so.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: Yeah, just kind of like an update as to what&#39;s going on or what you&#39;re feeling.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Wow. I really can\u2019t overstate how massively important platforms like AIM, Tumblr, MySpace\u2026 all of that were to those of us who needed a place where we could express in writing or in a safe way things that were really hard to express out loud. After the break, we\u2019ll finish up our conversation with Memes To Discuss in Therapy admin Priscilla Eva and dig into how her followers engage with her content. Plus, we\u2019ll talk about where darker mental health jokes fit into all of this.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. I\u2019m Anna Borges. Before the break we were talking about how following mental health memes accounts and posting about things like our mental health and chronic illness has helped an entire community of people find a new way to express themselves and connect. So let\u2019s go ahead and finish up our chat with Priscilla Eva. And as a reminder, Priscilla runs the Instagram and Facebook page Memes to Discuss in Therapy.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Obviously, what we&#39;re talking about is how we use these memes to support our mental health or like how they might not be so great for our mental health and that whole relationship. So, in your experience, how do you see how people interact with your page and share or comment or tag their friends? Like what kind of behavior do you see most often?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: One thing I absolutely adore about Memes to Discuss in Therapy and our followers is, now the ratio is much higher. It&#39;s like 99% of people who comment are really nice, they&#39;re supportive, or they&#39;re looking for support, you know. It&#39;s an interactive thing where we&#39;re all helping each other or feeling less alone. There&#39;s about 1% of people who are trolling, who are clearly just there to try to piss people off. And those people get blocked and banned immediately. So I try to keep them out of the comments. But, I find it so interesting that once I kind of shifted my, you know, personal posting from my personal SlyFox page, the memes page, still using the SlyFox, you know, me. But, just shifting the lens through, I guess, you know, what I&#39;m letting society look at me as saying, Hey, this is a mental health page, and we&#39;re going to be supportive of each other. I still talk about all the same stuff, but it&#39;s just, you know, it&#39;s just on the top, you know, this is Memes to Discuss in Therapy. And people are a lot more supportive than I have ever found, you know, elsewhere in internet life. And that&#39;s pretty freakin awesome. I love it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: I love that, that both like doesn&#39;t surprise me and surprises me, if only because like, I&#39;m kind of cynical. So I&#39;m like, hey, who knows? People can be assholes about anything, including mental health. But, I do think a space where people can have conversations that they don&#39;t get to have elsewhere, even on other pages, like I, can be hopefully welcoming for that. How do you see your followers interacting with the memes? And like, if you had to guess the various reasons that people follow these accounts and what they get from them? What would you say based on what you see?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: So we get, I have like multiple tiers of interaction we get on both the Facebook page and the Instagram page. There&#39;s people who are just liking and sharing and, you know, they never comment or anything. And that&#39;s great. If people are liking and sharing stuff, I assume it resonates with them, and that&#39;s awesome. That&#39;s the whole point. I love it. And then there&#39;s a lot of people who will comment and tag friends in their comments or a ton of people who will comment, say, like, Oh, I feel attacked, or if this isn&#39;t me, like, just really relating in the comments. And I love, I love seeing that in the comments. Because so often, someone will say, like, Oh, my God, this is totally me. And then you&#39;ll see someone comment underneath them saying, I thought I was the only one. There&#39;s a lot of stuff too, when I post about like suicidal ideation, or intrusive thoughts, like that&#39;s one of those things that our society doesn&#39;t like to talk about at all. And when we do talk about it, we have to put big warnings on it and say, This is really serious. We can&#39;t joke around about this. And I think for those of us who are at least me, like me personally, who deal with you know, intrusive thoughts or suicidal ideation on a daily basis. It&#39;s kind of hard to keep getting, getting the message over and over again, that something that&#39;s in your head every day is really wrong and like, something must be bad with you if, you know, you&#39;re having these things that pop into your head all the time. And that&#39;s another one that people messaged me all the time, or we get comments all the time, of people saying, oh my god, I thought I was the only one. And that&#39;s another one that I like to just say, No, you&#39;re not.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Nope. Absolutely. Yeah, this is resonating so much with me because I, I also deal with like, chronic, passive suicidal ideation is how I kind of describe it. And I wrote an essay about it a couple years ago, and still get messages that mean so much to me, for people who are like, I thought I was alone, I didn&#39;t feel this way. And I think it&#39;s a real gift to be able to joke about it with other people who get it. You know, and so like having these safe spaces where that will not be a red flag for one of my random followers just is so, so invaluable.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I do often wonder, I know that this kind of thing for people who don&#39;t speak this language, or who might not follow these accounts and who might not know that you dealt with this before, but now see through your page that you do, like, have you experienced people expressing worry?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: I, I personally have always been like very much an open book when it comes to my mental health, when it comes to my physical health. My mom was kind enough in high school, when my parents got divorced, she told all of us kids, like you each have to go see a therapist, I don&#39;t care if you go to one session, or if you go to 20 sessions, but like, I want to make sure we didn&#39;t break the kids, like, at least go and do just talk to a therapist for one hour. And if you never want to see him again, that&#39;s fine. But if you do, like, I&#39;ll pay for you to keep going. And she, I remember, she also would tell us, like, you know, one week in therapy at this age is going to be a year in therapy when you&#39;re my age. So like, if you feel like doing it, do it now. And so I totally took her up on that. And I did therapy for about a year, going weekly. And that was awesome. When I was, it was like, when I was 16 to 17. And it gave me a lot of coping skills that I think it usually takes most people into their young adult lives, you know, into their 20s or 30s to get, so I was very thankful for that. But because of that I was very open about my mental health, open about my depressive episodes and just open about, you know, what I was going through. And so for me personally, it&#39;s like, I don&#39;t think I scare anyone, cause they know who I am. However [laughs], I think there are some people that I know who have become more comfortable sharing about their mental health.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Oh, good!</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: Just like from interacting with me, interacting with the page, and they have run into that before where some of their like normie friends are like, Oh, are you okay? You&#39;re, like, sounding kind of dark or this or that. They&#39;re like, you know, I&#39;m just actually exploring these feelings I&#39;m having. I&#39;m like saying them out loud or putting them out there for other people to see, so.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: To kind of switch gears, one thing I did really want to ask is, it&#39;s not surprising at all, to me, but still so interesting to hear that obviously, your reach spiked, right around the beginning of the pandemic, when people were speaking this language. So I&#39;m really curious what kind of things in the past two years, what kind of topics you see resonate most with your audience?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: One of the big ones that has just like skyrocketed since the pandemic is social awkwardness. Lots of social awkward memes, and lots of social awkward conversations. But people like forgetting how to people because, you know, they only spend time with their roommates or their pets. And a lot of people talking about depression or loneliness that, you know, a lot of people are not comfortable or have not spent time like being by themselves, like, learning how to be a good friend to themselves. We&#39;ve had a lot more people just talking about weird thoughts. I&#39;d say like, intrusive thoughts, you know. During the pandemic, people are not in the routine of, you know, doing the same thing every day to keep their brain kind of distracted. So I think, like, a lot of weirdness crept in, but a lot of, you know, goodness, too. [Anna: absolutely] And, yeah, it&#39;s been interesting and cool to see all different people interact with that.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: What&#39;s, what&#39;s really striking me, funnily enough, is, as you&#39;re walking through the topics, it all sounds so earnest, and like serious and wholesome. But for people who haven&#39;t seen the page, these are all topics that are discussed in a really hilarious way, you know, and [Priscilla: yeah!] I wonder if, if you had to sum it up? How, what would you say is like the magic part of exploring these topics, but in like, a hilarious shitposting medium?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Priscilla Eva: The magic part for me is just the accessibility, because I think there&#39;s something about humor, especially something about dark humor, that allows us to laugh about things that, like, we&#39;re not even supposed to whisper about. And I think it&#39;s, sometimes it&#39;s that thin wedge in the door to actually open up a discussion about something. And man, I can&#39;t tell you how many people I know in real life, how many people I know through the pages, how many, just people who I&#39;ve talked to who say, you know, I started looking into depression, or anxiety, or OCD, or getting on medication, or dealing with my eating disorder, all this stuff you know, it started with making jokes about it and reposting memes or reposting silly little stories. And I was just joking about it. But then I realized maybe I&#39;m joking about it because it&#39;s something I actually care about. But once you allow yourself to laugh about it, rather than be scared about it, it opens up a door that you didn&#39;t know was there. And it allows you to, you know, really step in and explore those feelings in a new way. And for me, that&#39;s the magical part of it. And I just like the camaraderie too. I love knowing that there, you know, at any given time, I can post something on our Facebook or Instagram. And immediately we&#39;ll get responses from all over the world of people saying, yep, me too. [Anna: same!] I also experience that, like it&#39;s just nice to know that we are not alone.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Thank you again to Priscilla for talking to me about one of my favorite things. You can follow Priscilla\u2019s page if you\u2019ve decided this is something that could be for you either on Instagram or Facebook at Memes to Discuss in Therapy.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>There is one part of my BuzzFeed story that I left out at the top of the episode. Even with all of the negative comments and emails and tweets I was getting about that post, the, you know, 21 Tweets About Depression, there were a lot of supportive ones, too. People who related and who were thankful for the opportunity to see that other people related, too.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>They replied to the other commenters and essentially said, \u201cHey, just because this doesn\u2019t work for you doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. If you don\u2019t like it, if you don\u2019t find it funny, don\u2019t read it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the rule of thumb I kind of follow here, too. You know, we have agency to follow accounts that make us laugh and make us feel seen and that give us language to describe our experiences, just like we have the agency to unfollow the ones that make us feel bad and just don\u2019t work for us.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So I encourage you to get to know your mental health sense of humor and follow where it leads you, whether it\u2019s accounts like Priscilla\u2019s, or late night shitposting on Twitter (I tend to do a lot of that if you\u2019re not already following me). You know, weird bits on TikTok, specific creators that really get you \u2026 whatever genuinely makes you laugh and is a bright spot on your feed, cause there\u2019s plenty on social media that is not that, so the more you can feed in, the better.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>For those of you who do enjoy laughing about your mental health experience, I\u2019m curious: What are some of your favorite accounts and memes? Because I\u2019m always on the lookout for more. And I would love to get to know your sense of humor as well. So tag us in them, send them our way, check us out on Instagram or Twitter @moodringshow, and I\u2019m looking forward to laughing with you!</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>You can even tag me if you\u2019re really into it \u2014 I\u2019m @AnnaBroges on Twitter \u2013 that\u2019s Anna B-R-O-G-E-S\u2026because Anna Borges was taken.

I\u2019d been tasked with the challenge of finding a way to make mental health content shareable, and relatable, and viral. And that might sound like a ridiculously easy job in the year of our digital lord 2022, but it wasn\u2019t that long ago that the landscape of mental health content looked very different than it does today. Like on big mainstream websites, it was pretty much limited to serious and earnest personal essays and serious and earnest resource articles. And everything else was kind of like\u2026 you know\u2026 niche. Like it existed, but just in certain corners of the internet.\n\n\u00a0\nSo, I decided to try doing what I\u2019d long done in my little corners of the internet, I joked about my depression.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd it did not go well.\n\n\u00a0\nRECORD SCRATCH, CROWD GASP, YOUNG GIRL SHOUTING \u201cYOU NEED TO LEAVE\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nThe roundup in question was \u201c21 Tweets About Depression That Might Just Make You Laugh.\u201d A quintessential BuzzFeed list that I thought would make people laugh, and, you know, more importantly, maybe make them feel less alone.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd [laughs] man oh man, was I wrong. Instead, the comments and the emails and the tweets just came flooding in.\n\n\u00a0\nSOUNDS OF CROWD JEERING\n\n\u00a0\nAnonymous Commenter: \u201cI feel physically sick after reading this. This post is horrible.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnonymous Commenter: \u201cYou clearly have no experience with depression if you think these are funny.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: And, and I can\u2019t emphasize how mild these tweets were. You know, it was stuff like, \u201cIt\u2019s not called a nap, it\u2019s called a depression sleep.\u201d And like, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for my winter depression to end so I can get a start on my spring depression!\u201d Just completely innocuous tweets that you would probably see seventeen of a day these days. And the comments just kept coming.\n\n\u00a0\nAnonymous Commenter: \u201cThis is disrespectful to people who actually struggle.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nAnonymous Commenter: \u201cYou have no business writing about mental health.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nAnonymous Commenter: \u201cDepression isn\u2019t funny. Period. It never will be!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: And I couldn\u2019t help but immediately panic and wonder if I\u2019d made, like, some grave mistake. I was like, \u201cAre they right? Was my chosen coping mechanism disrespectful and out of touch? Should I have kept it a shameful secret? What is wrong with me!?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nWas joking about my mental health really so wrong?\n\n\u00a0\nMOOD RING THEME MUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings\u2026even when some people think your jokes about those feelings are pretty fucked up.\n\n\u00a0\nEvery episode, we\u2019re exploring one new way to cope \u2014 with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brain, with the internet or with the world around us.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Today\u2019s episode is about laughing about mental health. Our mental health. Specifically, laughing about our mental health by following accounts we find relatable and making it part of our regular social media diet.\n\n\u00a0\nNow to be clear, disclaimer up top, it\u2019s totally okay if jokes about mental health don\u2019t feel particularly funny to you. What makes us laugh is, you know, an extremely personal thing, especially where mental health is concerned. And far be it for me to try and tell people that they should find my tweets about wanting to die hilarious. It\u2019s not for everyone.\n\n\u00a0\nAll that said, I\u2019m really relieved that joking about mental health on social media is way more accepted than it used to be. Because now, all of my feeds are full of reminders that I\u2019m not alone, and they offer new ways to frame how I think about my struggles. And, I mean yeah,\u00a0 they make me laugh and laughing is great.\n\n\u00a0\nSo let\u2019s dig into why following mental health accounts is, you know, a small way to show yourself some love. Joining me is Priscilla Eva, who runs one of my favorite mental health accounts, Memes to Discuss in Therapy. And when I say memes to discuss in therapy, I don\u2019t mean wholesome memes that would make my therapist proud. I mean memes that would make my therapist like start scribbling a lot of notes.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd by that, I mean total shitposts.\n\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019re good if you\u2019re not actually familiar with this whole mental health shitposting thing\u2014the main thing you need to know is that they\u2019re the kind of posts that probably seem inappropriate or insensitive or dark from the outside. But when you are in on the joke? It\u2019s kind of like finding shorthand for the experiences that you thought no one else understood.\nSo let\u2019s dive into my conversation with Priscilla.\n\n\u00a0\nMUSIC FADE OUT\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: I would love to start by hearing from you, just for people who aren't familiar with the page how you would describe it, just to like anchor, anchor our listeners into like, what the f we're talking about.\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: It's just a meme shitposting page. And I like to say I specialize in curating and making memes for mental health and chronic illness. Because those are the two things I care about, mental health and chronic illness related things. And, those are the things that I find most resonant and like to share and repost or make memes of.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: So can you give me kind of the origin story of how you started this page, and like what led to it?\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: So my friend Tyler, they actually started the page about five years ago. And they started it for the same reason, wanted to just basically shit post mental health stuff. [Anna laughs] And it started as a Facebook page that was just, you know, sharing with a few friends. And then they made it public. And so I started helping, about four or five years ago?\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Oh, wow, I didn't realize the page had been alive for so long. I, I feel like a newcomer, like I'm a poser. I'm like, Oh, I've been a long term fan of memes to discuss in therapy. And it's like, oh, no, no,\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: Our growth only really, I think took off \u2026 a little bit before the pandemic started. [Anna: hmmmm] And I think the pandemic did a lot for people, you know, realizing that they maybe had mental health stuff that they wanted to address for just a plethora of reasons.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: It\u2019s, it became more mainstream.\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: Yes. And so then we got even more followers from that. And then, we started the Instagram, so we could cross post. And, that's kind of where we grew to where we are today.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: So before that, what was your relationship with social media like, or was that really when you dove full in?\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: Actually always had, you know, sort of flirtation ship with social media. I've had my SlyFox persona since high school, which was back in the MySpace days.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Same, same. I was a scene queen, you know, just being sad on the internet since 2004.\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: Yeah, so I've had my SlyFox persona since then. And I kind of use it as my, like, online posting alter ego.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: I feel often similarly when I talk about my mental health online. It's like there's how I talk about my mental health with my therapist and my friends, and then how I talk about it with it online and that difference there, but, it's not, so it sounds like you're someone who has always been comfortable on the internet in some way. Like an Internet person.\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: Yeah, I, oh gosh. I was very into AIM back in the day, the instant messenger. Yes, and MySpace, all that. Had a lot of online friendships. So it's like people I actually know, which is parlayed into what a lot of my relationships are as an adult. There's a lot of people I know from school, college, you know. And now from, like, my chronic illness stuff, different walks of life. People I've met in real life, but we usually only ever talk online because I have my chronic illness stuff like, you know, during the pandemic, since I'm immunocompromised, couldn't go out at all. [Anna: yeah] So, that kind of compounded it. But there's a lot of relationships I have with people that it's, you know, just messaging each other back and forth a few times a week, sending each other memes. And I'm surprised how similar it is to the AIM instant messages I was sending in high school.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: I am so glad that you said that, or so excited that you said that because literally, literally one of the things I was gonna, wanted to just share is that that is how it functions for me. Like my relationship to the memes, specifically, your page is one that I use a lot, is reposting them to stories kind of as an away message. You know, it used to be like emo song lyrics on my aim profile, and now it's like sad memes. And I just kind of like throw it out there to give people visibility into my sadness, so.\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: Yeah, just kind of like an update as to what's going on or what you're feeling.\n\n\u00a0\nWow. I really can\u2019t overstate how massively important platforms like AIM, Tumblr, MySpace\u2026 all of that were to those of us who needed a place where we could express in writing or in a safe way things that were really hard to express out loud. After the break, we\u2019ll finish up our conversation with Memes To Discuss in Therapy admin Priscilla Eva and dig into how her followers engage with her content. Plus, we\u2019ll talk about where darker mental health jokes fit into all of this.\n\n\u00a0\nMIDROLL\n\n\u00a0\nHey, welcome back to Mood Ring. I\u2019m Anna Borges. Before the break we were talking about how following mental health memes accounts and posting about things like our mental health and chronic illness has helped an entire community of people find a new way to express themselves and connect. So let\u2019s go ahead and finish up our chat with Priscilla Eva. And as a reminder, Priscilla runs the Instagram and Facebook page Memes to Discuss in Therapy.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Obviously, what we're talking about is how we use these memes to support our mental health or like how they might not be so great for our mental health and that whole relationship. So, in your experience, how do you see how people interact with your page and share or comment or tag their friends? Like what kind of behavior do you see most often?\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: One thing I absolutely adore about Memes to Discuss in Therapy and our followers is, now the ratio is much higher. It's like 99% of people who comment are really nice, they're supportive, or they're looking for support, you know. It's an interactive thing where we're all helping each other or feeling less alone. There's about 1% of people who are trolling, who are clearly just there to try to piss people off. And those people get blocked and banned immediately. So I try to keep them out of the comments. But, I find it so interesting that once I kind of shifted my, you know, personal posting from my personal SlyFox page, the memes page, still using the SlyFox, you know, me. But, just shifting the lens through, I guess, you know, what I'm letting society look at me as saying, Hey, this is a mental health page, and we're going to be supportive of each other. I still talk about all the same stuff, but it's just, you know, it's just on the top, you know, this is Memes to Discuss in Therapy. And people are a lot more supportive than I have ever found, you know, elsewhere in internet life. And that's pretty freakin awesome. I love it.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: I love that, that both like doesn't surprise me and surprises me, if only because like, I'm kind of cynical. So I'm like, hey, who knows? People can be assholes about anything, including mental health. But, I do think a space where people can have conversations that they don't get to have elsewhere, even on other pages, like I, can be hopefully welcoming for that. How do you see your followers interacting with the memes? And like, if you had to guess the various reasons that people follow these accounts and what they get from them? What would you say based on what you see?\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: So we get, I have like multiple tiers of interaction we get on both the Facebook page and the Instagram page. There's people who are just liking and sharing and, you know, they never comment or anything. And that's great. If people are liking and sharing stuff, I assume it resonates with them, and that's awesome. That's the whole point. I love it. And then there's a lot of people who will comment and tag friends in their comments or a ton of people who will comment, say, like, Oh, I feel attacked, or if this isn't me, like, just really relating in the comments. And I love, I love seeing that in the comments. Because so often, someone will say, like, Oh, my God, this is totally me. And then you'll see someone comment underneath them saying, I thought I was the only one. There's a lot of stuff too, when I post about like suicidal ideation, or intrusive thoughts, like that's one of those things that our society doesn't like to talk about at all. And when we do talk about it, we have to put big warnings on it and say, This is really serious. We can't joke around about this. And I think for those of us who are at least me, like me personally, who deal with you know, intrusive thoughts or suicidal ideation on a daily basis. It's kind of hard to keep getting, getting the message over and over again, that something that's in your head every day is really wrong and like, something must be bad with you if, you know, you're having these things that pop into your head all the time. And that's another one that people messaged me all the time, or we get comments all the time, of people saying, oh my god, I thought I was the only one. And that's another one that I like to just say, No, you're not.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Nope. Absolutely. Yeah, this is resonating so much with me because I, I also deal with like, chronic, passive suicidal ideation is how I kind of describe it. And I wrote an essay about it a couple years ago, and still get messages that mean so much to me, for people who are like, I thought I was alone, I didn't feel this way. And I think it's a real gift to be able to joke about it with other people who get it. You know, and so like having these safe spaces where that will not be a red flag for one of my random followers just is so, so invaluable.\n\n\u00a0\nI do often wonder, I know that this kind of thing for people who don't speak this language, or who might not follow these accounts and who might not know that you dealt with this before, but now see through your page that you do, like, have you experienced people expressing worry?\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: I, I personally have always been like very much an open book when it comes to my mental health, when it comes to my physical health. My mom was kind enough in high school, when my parents got divorced, she told all of us kids, like you each have to go see a therapist, I don't care if you go to one session, or if you go to 20 sessions, but like, I want to make sure we didn't break the kids, like, at least go and do just talk to a therapist for one hour. And if you never want to see him again, that's fine. But if you do, like, I'll pay for you to keep going. And she, I remember, she also would tell us, like, you know, one week in therapy at this age is going to be a year in therapy when you're my age. So like, if you feel like doing it, do it now. And so I totally took her up on that. And I did therapy for about a year, going weekly. And that was awesome. When I was, it was like, when I was 16 to 17. And it gave me a lot of coping skills that I think it usually takes most people into their young adult lives, you know, into their 20s or 30s to get, so I was very thankful for that. But because of that I was very open about my mental health, open about my depressive episodes and just open about, you know, what I was going through. And so for me personally, it's like, I don't think I scare anyone, cause they know who I am. However [laughs], I think there are some people that I know who have become more comfortable sharing about their mental health.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Oh, good!\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: Just like from interacting with me, interacting with the page, and they have run into that before where some of their like normie friends are like, Oh, are you okay? You're, like, sounding kind of dark or this or that. They're like, you know, I'm just actually exploring these feelings I'm having. I'm like saying them out loud or putting them out there for other people to see, so.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: To kind of switch gears, one thing I did really want to ask is, it's not surprising at all, to me, but still so interesting to hear that obviously, your reach spiked, right around the beginning of the pandemic, when people were speaking this language. So I'm really curious what kind of things in the past two years, what kind of topics you see resonate most with your audience?\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: One of the big ones that has just like skyrocketed since the pandemic is social awkwardness. Lots of social awkward memes, and lots of social awkward conversations. But people like forgetting how to people because, you know, they only spend time with their roommates or their pets. And a lot of people talking about depression or loneliness that, you know, a lot of people are not comfortable or have not spent time like being by themselves, like, learning how to be a good friend to themselves. We've had a lot more people just talking about weird thoughts. I'd say like, intrusive thoughts, you know. During the pandemic, people are not in the routine of, you know, doing the same thing every day to keep their brain kind of distracted. So I think, like, a lot of weirdness crept in, but a lot of, you know, goodness, too. [Anna: absolutely] And, yeah, it's been interesting and cool to see all different people interact with that.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: What's, what's really striking me, funnily enough, is, as you're walking through the topics, it all sounds so earnest, and like serious and wholesome. But for people who haven't seen the page, these are all topics that are discussed in a really hilarious way, you know, and [Priscilla: yeah!] I wonder if, if you had to sum it up? How, what would you say is like the magic part of exploring these topics, but in like, a hilarious shitposting medium?\n\n\u00a0\nPriscilla Eva: The magic part for me is just the accessibility, because I think there's something about humor, especially something about dark humor, that allows us to laugh about things that, like, we're not even supposed to whisper about. And I think it's, sometimes it's that thin wedge in the door to actually open up a discussion about something. And man, I can't tell you how many people I know in real life, how many people I know through the pages, how many, just people who I've talked to who say, you know, I started looking into depression, or anxiety, or OCD, or getting on medication, or dealing with my eating disorder, all this stuff you know, it started with making jokes about it and reposting memes or reposting silly little stories. And I was just joking about it. But then I realized maybe I'm joking about it because it's something I actually care about. But once you allow yourself to laugh about it, rather than be scared about it, it opens up a door that you didn't know was there. And it allows you to, you know, really step in and explore those feelings in a new way. And for me, that's the magical part of it. And I just like the camaraderie too. I love knowing that there, you know, at any given time, I can post something on our Facebook or Instagram. And immediately we'll get responses from all over the world of people saying, yep, me too. [Anna: same!] I also experience that, like it's just nice to know that we are not alone.\n\n\u00a0\nThank you again to Priscilla for talking to me about one of my favorite things. You can follow Priscilla\u2019s page if you\u2019ve decided this is something that could be for you either on Instagram or Facebook at Memes to Discuss in Therapy.\n\n\u00a0\nThere is one part of my BuzzFeed story that I left out at the top of the episode. Even with all of the negative comments and emails and tweets I was getting about that post, the, you know, 21 Tweets About Depression, there were a lot of supportive ones, too. People who related and who were thankful for the opportunity to see that other people related, too.\n\n\u00a0\nThey replied to the other commenters and essentially said, \u201cHey, just because this doesn\u2019t work for you doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. If you don\u2019t like it, if you don\u2019t find it funny, don\u2019t read it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the rule of thumb I kind of follow here, too. You know, we have agency to follow accounts that make us laugh and make us feel seen and that give us language to describe our experiences, just like we have the agency to unfollow the ones that make us feel bad and just don\u2019t work for us.\n\n\u00a0\nSo I encourage you to get to know your mental health sense of humor and follow where it leads you, whether it\u2019s accounts like Priscilla\u2019s, or late night shitposting on Twitter (I tend to do a lot of that if you\u2019re not already following me). You know, weird bits on TikTok, specific creators that really get you \u2026 whatever genuinely makes you laugh and is a bright spot on your feed, cause there\u2019s plenty on social media that is not that, so the more you can feed in, the better.\n\n\u00a0\nFor those of you who do enjoy laughing about your mental health experience, I\u2019m curious: What are some of your favorite accounts and memes? Because I\u2019m always on the lookout for more. And I would love to get to know your sense of humor as well. So tag us in them, send them our way, check us out on Instagram or Twitter @moodringshow, and I\u2019m looking forward to laughing with you!\n\n\u00a0\nYou can even tag me if you\u2019re really into it \u2014 I\u2019m @AnnaBroges on Twitter \u2013 that\u2019s Anna B-R-O-G-E-S\u2026because Anna Borges was taken.

And I guess that comes with all of the disclaimers that you would expect.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>[sighs] All right\u2026 I wrote\u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p><em>I need to get my shit together. It sounds so easy, but why have I always failed so miserably? I don\u2019t know how I let myself get so far behind, or why I can\u2019t delay instant gratification, or when I got so fucking lazy. I know what I have to do. Why can\u2019t I just do it? What is wrong with me?</em></p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I know I only wrote that in freshman year of high school because of the date at the top of the page. Because to be honest, like, I\u2019ve probably written some variation of that a hundred times over in the decade and a half since then. And maybe you have too? Berating yourself for something - for not being good enough, or fast enough, or a million other things. And for me, it was my inability to focus, to accomplish my goals, to function, basically, the way that I thought I should be able to function because it seemed like everyone BUT ME could do it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>It was a recurring subplot in my journals for <em>years.</em></p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And then, eventually\u2014like 15 years later eventually\u2014I got diagnosed with ADHD.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>[laughs] So\u2026yeah. Which, that cleared a lot of things up in hindsight.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And while I felt some relief at having an explanation, I also felt this, like, sense of grief for this person I thought I knew. Like, how could it be that all of these core beliefs about myself, as unkind as they were, were suddenly just\u2026wrong?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>What do you do when you discover you\u2019ve been an unreliable narrator of your own story this whole time?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hey friends, what\u2019s up?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings\u2014even when your feelings about yourself feel like cold hard facts.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Every episode, we\u2019re exploring one new way to cope \u2014 with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, with the world around us. And with the unkind stories we tell ourselves about ourselves.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And today, we\u2019re talking about how the stories we\u2019ve told ourselves about ourselves can burrow their way into our brains and impact our self-worth and even our whole self-concept. And a lot of those narratives come from messages we get about who we\u2019re supposed to be, or how we\u2019re expected to function, or how our lived experiences fit the mold of what we\u2019re told is normal or acceptable or right.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>After my diagnosis, I started to wonder, like: how many of us are carrying around stories that we believe wholeheartedly, stories that tell us we\u2019re not good enough or smart enough or talented enough or worthy enough?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So this episode is about stories. Stories we tell ourselves and stories others tell us ABOUT ourselves, and how we can do the work to untangle it all.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>To help us with all that untangling, I reached out to Dr. Renee Lemus and Dr. Christina Rose. Together, they host the podcast Las Doctoras and run a writing course that seeks to help students decolonize their writing and use storytelling as a form of healing. Through their work, they help people reclaim their voices and rewrite their stories in a way that\u2019s authentic to <em>them</em>.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MUSIC FADE OUT</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Dr. Lemus and Dr. Rose, thank you so much for joining me today! I&#39;d love for us to just dive right in and start talking about these narratives that we have about ourselves and where they come from. Specifically, it can be this feedback loop, you know? Of \u2026 stories that we&#39;ve been told about ourselves that we then go on to tell the world about who we are or tell ourselves about who we are. So kind of a big question, but how does the outside world and all of the messages that we receive from it impact our own messaging?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Dr. Lemus: You know we&#39;re, we&#39;re gender studies professors, right? We&#39;re women&#39;s studies professors. We&#39;re always going to have that feminist perspective on things and add that lens. I think a big, we&#39;ve always named that a big part of what we do in our classes is to give language to our experiences, right. But I think we live in a world that wants to say that if we experienced oppression, it&#39;s our fault. It&#39;s something that we did wrong or we didn&#39;t do something right. And I think, or, or wants to gaslight our experience and say, no, you didn&#39;t experience that. Like, that you&#39;re [Anna: yeah] you&#39;re just being too sensitive. And so I think we always come in to say, like, to validate that experience and say, yes, you experienced sexism. Yes, you experienced racism. And to give language to things that we already know in our bodies, right. And, and validate those experiences as some, and to know where to place, not the blame, but to place our frustrations. And so I think for us, we, when it comes to our story, we can feel empowered to tell our story, because we know that \u2026 we&#39;re not the only ones experiencing it and it&#39;s not our fault. Right. It&#39;s not, it&#39;s not a flaw in us that we can&#39;t meet every need of our household and our children, because the structures of society don&#39;t give us enough support to do those things!</p><br/><p>Anna: I, I, I work with therapists all day. So like, I&#39;m like putting the answer out there as though I know it, but like, I imagine gaining awareness of these type of narratives and messages that you&#39;ve internalized has to be this first step, because otherwise, how can you start to rewrite them? And so how, how can we start to gain that awareness?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Dr. Rose: Well we&#39;re learning, I think to check in with our bodies, you know [Anna: yeah!] I think our bodies can really tell us those things, you know? I think that, you know, again, that narrative that would have us basically sacrifice ourself for any cause, anything or just, I don&#39;t know. For, for labor, for, you know, the common good, for religion, for family and all these things. Really takes a toll on our whole being. And sometimes it is our body that can, can really give us the, the truthful and not like not, or a real, like it doesn&#39;t. I say, my, my body doesn&#39;t lie. You know, it&#39;s like the, the book, that, My Body Keeps the Score or something like that. But if my back hurts, you know, or if my shoulders hurt, like, that&#39;s undeniable, it&#39;s like, it&#39;s kind, it&#39;s not like I can, from this air, you know, earthy air perspective, kind of convince myself. I can just think about my feelings, right. We were talking about that too. Like, I actually need to feel them. I need to cry. And that&#39;s, so I know when I&#39;m crying or I know when I actually do some things for my body that could be movement. It could actually be like artwork. It could be like meditation, it could be stretching. You know, I think that&#39;s, that&#39;s where I know I&#39;m doing, I&#39;m taking at least the first step, you know, and when my body talks to me and I listen, maybe that&#39;s even the, the, the step before.</p><br/><p>Dr. Lemus: If we&#39;re tired, we&#39;re tired. Right. And we&#39;re going to, so I, I definitely think it starts with really just a lot of self-reflection. I wanted to say, I think another important part of this is like, where do we start is community. [Dr. Rose: Yes!] Who you [laughs] you, you&#39;ve surrounded yourself with, because I mean, and, and I would say like, for me, there&#39;s different communities, right, that I&#39;m in, and some give me this certain part that I need and this other, you know. But I think again, when you&#39;re in academia, right, or in any kind of, let&#39;s say mainstream or even corporate or whatever kind of environment that you don&#39;t feel is like your safe environment. You need somewhere to feel safe, where you can let go, where you can [laughs] you can call and rant and say, oh my God, I experienced this thing, you know? [laughs] Which is basically what our podcast is, is just about ranting about things. But I think community where you can feel safe, where they can validate your experiences. Where you have very similar values. Where you&#39;re invested in the same things and feel supported so that \u2026 you&#39;re not always having to be productive. Where you can pick up where each other left off. Because I have community, I&#39;m able to validate my experiences more and I&#39;m able to feel empowered in my story more because I&#39;m not being gas- like society&#39;s gonna gaslight us all day long. So when you have a community and somebody to say, no, yes, you deserve to rest or you deserve \u2026 it&#39;s okay that you&#39;re angry. Then that just, ugh, it feels like you can, you know, rest a lot more. [Anna: oh!]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Dr. Rose: I just want to name that that&#39;s intentional too, like, you know? Just, you know, society, or like the Western framework really wants us to be like an, like a disembodied head that just like, like does stuff, you know, produces things\u2026</p><br/><p>Anna: \u2026and questions our experience too.</p><br/><p>Dr. Rose: And also yes. And it wants us to be isolated too. Like, it&#39;s, they do wanna create this abusive relationship dynamic where you can&#39;t reach out to your community, like you should handle this alone. So I just think those messages are real. And I just wanna, I wanna know, that everyone to know that it&#39;s not, you, you know, and, and liberating yourself from that, you know, reaching out and to other people and, and, and to your body is, you know, radical, radical feminism.</p><br/><p>Anna: It\u2019s really stuck with me, the point Dr. Lemus and Dr. Rose make about how these harmful narratives we have about ourselves can fester in isolation. Because I don\u2019t know about you, but when I\u2019m alone, I don\u2019t stop to question the voice in my head that says I\u2019m defective. I don\u2019t think to ask, \u201cWait, who\u2019s voice is that and how did it get in there?\u201d And when those thoughts go unchallenged for long enough, that\u2019s when they become part of the story I tell myself about myself.</p><br/><p>After the break, we\u2019ll talk about what it means to rewrite our stories\u2014especially when we\u2019ve believed a different narrative for so long.</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>Anna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. I\u2019m Anna Borges. Before the break, we were talking to\u00a0 Dr. Renee Lemus and Dr. Christina Rose about rewriting the self-destructive stories we tell ourselves. Let\u2019s get back to it.</p><br/><p>Anna: I like to say in therapy and like, you know, when we talk about stuff like narrative therapy, for example, which is kind of like the brain process that I, I, I followed for this episode, but. I like to say when my therapist and I talk about doing this kind of exercise of like rewriting my story, I get super overwhelmed, trying to figure out, I&#39;m like, which part of my story, whose story, what, what does rewriting it mean? How do I write my story?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Dr. Lemus: Yeah, this is, this is where, I mean, we would say, this is where ceremony comes in. This is where, writing is the small part of it, right. It&#39;s to say, first, you have to be present in your body. Right. So whatever that means to you, whether it&#39;s meditation, whether it&#39;s dancing, whether it&#39;s\u2026 doing some art, like, whatever that looks like to you, that it means to be present in your body. Kind of letting go of [Dr. Rose: past] you know, all the other things. Yeah. And just being in the moment. So part of my meditation practice, and part of something that Christine and I do in our courses, in our meditation or our like grounding centering practices is to call in our ancestors, is to call in whatever spiritual guides, you know, you&#39;re down with. And, or even calling in our inner child. [Anna: yeah] Calling in our higher self. Right. All of those, all the parts of us that sometimes we forget. Our imagination. Like, that&#39;s a big thing that we do in our courses is we think that \u2026 [Dr. Rose: Intuition] Intuition, like we think, like kids are so imaginative they&#39;re so in their imagination. And then at some point we let that go, cuz we think we have to be realistic. And so we&#39;re like, how can we tap back into that? And so it&#39;s, it&#39;s yeah. It&#39;s getting centered, you know, calling in maybe whatever spiritual guides you have. And then just kind of, yeah. I start just asking myself, like, if I was interviewing myself, like, how&#39;s it going today? Or, you know, or maybe I am pissed about something and just like ranting. And, and what that does. And again, something else we do in our course, is we do like these warm up writing activities, just write without thinking. And many, I mean, you can, you can look up prompts, online, whatever. And in doing that, it gets those juices flowing. And then what you really want to write about kind of comes through, but it&#39;s hard to do that when you&#39;re like sitting cold, right. You&#39;re like, I&#39;m gonna go write. And you&#39;re sitting there and you&#39;re like nothing\u2019s happening, right. Or I don&#39;t know what to do or-</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Or why can&#39;t I run this marathon right now? [laughs]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Dr. Lemus: Yeah. And so it&#39;s to say like, give yourself grace, you know, it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect. Just kind of literally just write anything, anything. Sometimes I will even read something and I&#39;ll like rewrite just to have that \u2026 that somatic experience of writing something, even if I&#39;m like quoting another book. And then once my body starts getting going, I, my, my voice starts to come out.</p><br/><p>Dr. Rose: And it doesn&#39;t have like an end goal either. Like I was even thinking, you could begin with recording your dreams, you know, in some way [Anna: ah that&#39;s a great place to start] You know, cuz I think, or even just listening, listening to your dreams, you know, and waking up and it could be, it could be like a journal. It could be written down or you could just voice memo it, like this is what I dreamed, you know, like that&#39;s a beautiful, that&#39;s a beautiful space of listening and hearing and listening and writing, you know, recording.</p><br/><p>Anna: Love that. So we&#39;ve been talking about writing and now I would like to talk about metaphorically rewriting because for me, like I&#39;m a big journaler and what I, what I&#39;ve been thinking about a lot lately is when I journal that&#39;s often the first time I&#39;m telling my story to myself, you know, it&#39;s like seeing my own thoughts in black and white and conversing with myself. And I also like to reread my journals a lot and going back and saying like, oh, okay, like, this is how I thought about this at the time, sometimes it&#39;s changed. And sometimes I&#39;m like, oh, that is how I thought about it at the time. And how it&#39;s, I&#39;ve been thinking about it ever since. And like, I would like to rethink about this thing that I was telling myself. And so I&#39;m curious if you have any sort of like, if that shows up in like in your work, in like a literal way too, like how you literally rewrite or retell your stories yourself when you found out that the first one was not the story that you wanted to tell yourself.</p><br/><p>Dr. Lemus: I think it&#39;s just having grace for your own growth. Like grace is such a big theme for us is just like really giving yourself permission to just be where you&#39;re at now. I, that&#39;s what I tell my students. I say, wherever your relationship is with, you know, whatever, like the world it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s not gonna always be like this. It&#39;s going to evolve. It&#39;s going to change and that&#39;s okay. You know, even your identity, right? Your relationship with your identity, that&#39;s gonna change. That&#39;s going to evolve. Nothing is stagnant. And so I think just giving yourself grace for what your story used to be. And, and, I was telling some of my students cuz we were rounding up the semester and they were like, oh I think I&#39;m too confrontational. Cuz I, I&#39;ll call people out on too much. And I&#39;m like, I&#39;m too much.</p><br/><p>Anna: Oh, big narrative I see a lot.</p><br/><p>Dr. Lemus: And I tell them one, you&#39;re not too much. Two, I said, I was like that when I was in my twenties and I am much more discerning now of where I put my energy, but I am so grateful to my 20 year old self for being so confrontational with people because it allowed me to set boundaries. So I think it&#39;s like, yes, I have evolved. But I&#39;m also really grateful for those times, those things that I did, or even those stories that I would tell myself because it helped me to, to evolve, right. Those, because I got those stories out of me, then I was able to like make room to process and grow.</p><br/><p>Anna: What&#39;s so funny is that&#39;s I think the process I go through when I reread by journals, you know, I think, I think of my past self in a certain way, usually like a not very nice way and like rereading how I was telling myself the story and the time, now that leads me to like that kind of thing. Like, oh, okay. Well my new story is like, no, I didn&#39;t used to be like XYZ, negative thought. There are too many to pick from right now, you know, it was actually this. So, Christina, what would you add?</p><br/><p>Dr. Rose: I was thinking of the danger of the single story, you know, this sense of that. And, and I&#39;m, again, this world that we were raised in believes that even like we only have one narrative going on in ourselves, you know\u2026</p><br/><p>Anna: Multiplicity who? We are one, never changing person.</p><br/><p>Dr. Lemus: Right, monolithic.</p><br/><p>Dr. Rose: And one of the exercises that we often do is, we, week six or something in our, you know, eight week course, we&#39;ll take a look at something we wrote in week one or two. And we&#39;ll look at it from a perspective of, like, a loving adult, which we are, you know [laughs] you know, coming to that, coming back to a piece of writing from a place of grace, I love that love. And as, and, and as if we were, you know, the, the parent of the person who wrote that or the caretaker or the abuela or the elder, you know, but from a place of the love that we give to other people, you know, the love we give to those that we take care of. And so I think that&#39;s a, so that \u2026 exercise is such a shift in perspective for me too, you know, because yes, when I do go through my journals, I don&#39;t do it annually. I do do it like, probably every seven years or so. And it is a big deal and I do cry and it is, you know, it is, and it&#39;s beautiful. And it&#39;s also like heartbreaking. I&#39;m like mija, like what the heck were you giving your energy to that person? Like, like no more, you know, it&#39;s, it&#39;s a big lesson, you know, for me. And um, and I do try to make it a ceremony too, you know, because I need, in order to come from a place of love, often I need my guides, I need my ancestors. I need the spirit world to be like around me, those who love me, you know? So that&#39;s what I would add.</p><br/><p>Anna: Before we wrapped, I was going to ask if someone was listening and just was like raring to go start scribbling where they would start. But I, I love both of the things that you just outlined, whether it&#39;s expanding on something with curiosity or writing to, to your younger self, your inner child. Those both sound like great places, so unless you have something else that you would suggest to our listeners for like one last writing prompt,</p><br/><p>Dr. Lemus: One last one last writing prompts is to like, do an outline of a children&#39;s, like a children&#39;s book where you&#39;re the main character, right? Like, and what would her superpowers be or their superpowers be and what would their environment be like? And yeah.</p><br/><p>Anna: Ahhhh! That is, is so good. I, I wanna go do that like right now, but this has been such an amazing conversation. I wish it could go on for like two more hours. So thank you for, for joining me today and talking about some of my favorite things and sharing some of your beautiful insights that I wanted to go write about now. So.</p><br/><p>Dr. Lemus: Thank you. Thank you for having, for having us.</p><br/><p>Anna: There\u2019s a reason I think of my later-in-life diagnosis when I think of the importance of rewriting my story or how I tell my story. It\u2019s that, like, our understanding of ourselves is always changing. Or like Dr. Rose said, we don\u2019t only have one story. We\u2019re made up of stories, past and present, and rewriting isn\u2019t about like denying the truth of our experiences at the time or correcting ourselves in retrospect\u2014it\u2019s about releasing the false narratives that we\u2019re still holding onto as true, you know, so we can make room for the stories we want to tell.</p><br/><p>And\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t know about you, but I think the next story I want to try telling is that children\u2019s book Dr. Lemus was talking about.

            "contentSnippet": "Host Anna Borges (The More Or Less Definitive Guide to Self-Care) is joined by Dr. Renee Lemus and Dr. Christina Rose\u2013hosts of Las Doctoras podcast\u2013about rewriting the stories we tell ourselves about who we are and rewiring the messaging that comes from the world about who we\u2019re allowed to be.\u00a0\n\nFollow Mood Ring @moodringshow\u00a0\n\nFollow Anna @annabroges\n\nFollow Las Doctoras podcast online at lasdoctoras.net.\u00a0\n\nMood Ring is a production of American Public Media and Pizza Shark!\n\n\nFull Transcript\n\n\nAnna Borges: Let\u2019s kick things off by reading an old journal entry of mine from freshman year of high school. And I guess that comes with all of the disclaimers that you would expect.\n\n\u00a0\n[sighs] All right\u2026 I wrote\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nI need to get my shit together. It sounds so easy, but why have I always failed so miserably? I don\u2019t know how I let myself get so far behind, or why I can\u2019t delay instant gratification, or when I got so fucking lazy. I know what I have to do. Why can\u2019t I just do it? What is wrong with me?\n\n\u00a0\nI know I only wrote that in freshman year of high school because of the date at the top of the page. Because to be honest, like, I\u2019ve probably written some variation of that a hundred times over in the decade and a half since then. And maybe you have too? Berating yourself for something - for not being good enough, or fast enough, or a million other things. And for me, it was my inability to focus, to accomplish my goals, to function, basically, the way that I thought I should be able to function because it seemed like everyone BUT ME could do it.\n\n\u00a0\nIt was a recurring subplot in my journals for years.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd then, eventually\u2014like 15 years later eventually\u2014I got diagnosed with ADHD.\n\n\u00a0\nTHEME MUSIC\n\n\u00a0\n[laughs] So\u2026yeah. Which, that cleared a lot of things up in hindsight.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd while I felt some relief at having an explanation, I also felt this, like, sense of grief for this person I thought I knew. Like, how could it be that all of these core beliefs about myself, as unkind as they were, were suddenly just\u2026wrong?\n\n\u00a0\nWhat do you do when you discover you\u2019ve been an unreliable narrator of your own story this whole time?\n\n\u00a0\nHey friends, what\u2019s up?\n\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings\u2014even when your feelings about yourself feel like cold hard facts.\n\n\u00a0\nEvery episode, we\u2019re exploring one new way to cope \u2014 with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, with the world around us. And with the unkind stories we tell ourselves about ourselves.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd today, we\u2019re talking about how the stories we\u2019ve told ourselves about ourselves can burrow their way into our brains and impact our self-worth and even our whole self-concept. And a lot of those narratives come from messages we get about who we\u2019re supposed to be, or how we\u2019re expected to function, or how our lived experiences fit the mold of what we\u2019re told is normal or acceptable or right.\n\n\u00a0\nMUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nAfter my diagnosis, I started to wonder, like: how many of us are carrying around stories that we believe wholeheartedly, stories that tell us we\u2019re not good enough or smart enough or talented enough or worthy enough?\n\n\u00a0\nSo this episode is about stories. Stories we tell ourselves and stories others tell us ABOUT ourselves, and how we can do the work to untangle it all.\n\n\u00a0\nTo help us with all that untangling, I reached out to Dr. Renee Lemus and Dr. Christina Rose. Together, they host the podcast Las Doctoras and run a writing course that seeks to help students decolonize their writing and use storytelling as a form of healing. Through their work, they help people reclaim their voices and rewrite their stories in a way that\u2019s authentic to them.\n\n\u00a0\nMUSIC FADE OUT\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Dr. Lemus and Dr. Rose, thank you so much for joining me today! I'd love for us to just dive right in and start talking about these narratives that we have about ourselves and where they come from. Specifically, it can be this feedback loop, you know? Of \u2026 stories that we've been told about ourselves that we then go on to tell the world about who we are or tell ourselves about who we are. So kind of a big question, but how does the outside world and all of the messages that we receive from it impact our own messaging?\n\n\u00a0\nDr. Lemus: You know we're, we're gender studies professors, right? We're women's studies professors. We're always going to have that feminist perspective on things and add that lens. I think a big, we've always named that a big part of what we do in our classes is to give language to our experiences, right. But I think we live in a world that wants to say that if we experienced oppression, it's our fault. It's something that we did wrong or we didn't do something right. And I think, or, or wants to gaslight our experience and say, no, you didn't experience that. Like, that you're [Anna: yeah] you're just being too sensitive. And so I think we always come in to say, like, to validate that experience and say, yes, you experienced sexism. Yes, you experienced racism. And to give language to things that we already know in our bodies, right. And, and validate those experiences as some, and to know where to place, not the blame, but to place our frustrations. And so I think for us, we, when it comes to our story, we can feel empowered to tell our story, because we know that \u2026 we're not the only ones experiencing it and it's not our fault. Right. It's not, it's not a flaw in us that we can't meet every need of our household and our children, because the structures of society don't give us enough support to do those things!\n\nAnna: I, I, I work with therapists all day. So like, I'm like putting the answer out there as though I know it, but like, I imagine gaining awareness of these type of narratives and messages that you've internalized has to be this first step, because otherwise, how can you start to rewrite them? And so how, how can we start to gain that awareness?\n\n\u00a0\nDr. Rose: Well we're learning, I think to check in with our bodies, you know [Anna: yeah!] I think our bodies can really tell us those things, you know? I think that, you know, again, that narrative that would have us basically sacrifice ourself for any cause, anything or just, I don't know. For, for labor, for, you know, the common good, for religion, for family and all these things. Really takes a toll on our whole being. And sometimes it is our body that can, can really give us the, the truthful and not like not, or a real, like it doesn't. I say, my, my body doesn't lie. You know, it's like the, the book, that, My Body Keeps the Score or something like that. But if my back hurts, you know, or if my shoulders hurt, like, that's undeniable, it's like, it's kind, it's not like I can, from this air, you know, earthy air perspective, kind of convince myself. I can just think about my feelings, right. We were talking about that too. Like, I actually need to feel them. I need to cry. And that's, so I know when I'm crying or I know when I actually do some things for my body that could be movement. It could actually be like artwork. It could be like meditation, it could be stretching. You know, I think that's, that's where I know I'm doing, I'm taking at least the first step, you know, and when my body talks to me and I listen, maybe that's even the, the, the step before.\n\nDr. Lemus: If we're tired, we're tired. Right. And we're going to, so I, I definitely think it starts with really just a lot of self-reflection. I wanted to say, I think another important part of this is like, where do we start is community. [Dr. Rose: Yes!] Who you [laughs] you, you've surrounded yourself with, because I mean, and, and I would say like, for me, there's different communities, right, that I'm in, and some give me this certain part that I need and this other, you know. But I think again, when you're in academia, right, or in any kind of, let's say mainstream or even corporate or whatever kind of environment that you don't feel is like your safe environment. You need somewhere to feel safe, where you can let go, where you can [laughs] you can call and rant and say, oh my God, I experienced this thing, you know? [laughs] Which is basically what our podcast is, is just about ranting about things. But I think community where you can feel safe, where they can validate your experiences. Where you have very similar values. Where you're invested in the same things and feel supported so that \u2026 you're not always having to be productive. Where you can pick up where each other left off. Because I have community, I'm able to validate my experiences more and I'm able to feel empowered in my story more because I'm not being gas- like society's gonna gaslight us all day long. So when you have a community and somebody to say, no, yes, you deserve to rest or you deserve \u2026 it's okay that you're angry. Then that just, ugh, it feels like you can, you know, rest a lot more. [Anna: oh!]\n\n\u00a0\nDr. Rose: I just want to name that that's intentional too, like, you know? Just, you know, society, or like the Western framework really wants us to be like an, like a disembodied head that just like, like does stuff, you know, produces things\u2026\n\nAnna: \u2026and questions our experience too.\n\nDr. Rose: And also yes. And it wants us to be isolated too. Like, it's, they do wanna create this abusive relationship dynamic where you can't reach out to your community, like you should handle this alone. So I just think those messages are real. And I just wanna, I wanna know, that everyone to know that it's not, you, you know, and, and liberating yourself from that, you know, reaching out and to other people and, and, and to your body is, you know, radical, radical feminism.\n\nAnna: It\u2019s really stuck with me, the point Dr. Lemus and Dr. Rose make about how these harmful narratives we have about ourselves can fester in isolation. Because I don\u2019t know about you, but when I\u2019m alone, I don\u2019t stop to question the voice in my head that says I\u2019m defective. I don\u2019t think to ask, \u201cWait, who\u2019s voice is that and how did it get in there?\u201d And when those thoughts go unchallenged for long enough, that\u2019s when they become part of the story I tell myself about myself.\n\nAfter the break, we\u2019ll talk about what it means to rewrite our stories\u2014especially when we\u2019ve believed a different narrative for so long.\n\nMIDROLL\n\nAnna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. I\u2019m Anna Borges. Before the break, we were talking to\u00a0 Dr. Renee Lemus and Dr. Christina Rose about rewriting the self-destructive stories we tell ourselves. Let\u2019s get back to it.\n\nAnna: I like to say in therapy and like, you know, when we talk about stuff like narrative therapy, for example, which is kind of like the brain process that I, I, I followed for this episode, but. I like to say when my therapist and I talk about doing this kind of exercise of like rewriting my story, I get super overwhelmed, trying to figure out, I'm like, which part of my story, whose story, what, what does rewriting it mean? How do I write my story?\n\n\u00a0\nDr. Lemus: Yeah, this is, this is where, I mean, we would say, this is where ceremony comes in. This is where, writing is the small part of it, right. It's to say, first, you have to be present in your body. Right. So whatever that means to you, whether it's meditation, whether it's dancing, whether it's\u2026 doing some art, like, whatever that looks like to you, that it means to be present in your body. Kind of letting go of [Dr. Rose: past] you know, all the other things. Yeah. And just being in the moment. So part of my meditation practice, and part of something that Christine and I do in our courses, in our meditation or our like grounding centering practices is to call in our ancestors, is to call in whatever spiritual guides, you know, you're down with. And, or even calling in our inner child. [Anna: yeah] Calling in our higher self. Right. All of those, all the parts of us that sometimes we forget. Our imagination. Like, that's a big thing that we do in our courses is we think that \u2026 [Dr. Rose: Intuition] Intuition, like we think, like kids are so imaginative they're so in their imagination. And then at some point we let that go, cuz we think we have to be realistic. And so we're like, how can we tap back into that? And so it's, it's yeah. It's getting centered, you know, calling in maybe whatever spiritual guides you have. And then just kind of, yeah. I start just asking myself, like, if I was interviewing myself, like, how's it going today? Or, you know, or maybe I am pissed about something and just like ranting. And, and what that does. And again, something else we do in our course, is we do like these warm up writing activities, just write without thinking. And many, I mean, you can, you can look up prompts, online, whatever. And in doing that, it gets those juices flowing. And then what you really want to write about kind of comes through, but it's hard to do that when you're like sitting cold, right. You're like, I'm gonna go write. And you're sitting there and you're like nothing\u2019s happening, right. Or I don't know what to do or-\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Or why can't I run this marathon right now? [laughs]\n\n\u00a0\nDr. Lemus: Yeah. And so it's to say like, give yourself grace, you know, it doesn't have to be perfect. Just kind of literally just write anything, anything. Sometimes I will even read something and I'll like rewrite just to have that \u2026 that somatic experience of writing something, even if I'm like quoting another book. And then once my body starts getting going, I, my, my voice starts to come out.\n\nDr. Rose: And it doesn't have like an end goal either. Like I was even thinking, you could begin with recording your dreams, you know, in some way [Anna: ah that's a great place to start] You know, cuz I think, or even just listening, listening to your dreams, you know, and waking up and it could be, it could be like a journal. It could be written down or you could just voice memo it, like this is what I dreamed, you know, like that's a beautiful, that's a beautiful space of listening and hearing and listening and writing, you know, recording.\n\nAnna: Love that. So we've been talking about writing and now I would like to talk about metaphorically rewriting because for me, like I'm a big journaler and what I, what I've been thinking about a lot lately is when I journal that's often the first time I'm telling my story to myself, you know, it's like seeing my own thoughts in black and white and conversing with myself. And I also like to reread my journals a lot and going back and saying like, oh, okay, like, this is how I thought about this at the time, sometimes it's changed. And sometimes I'm like, oh, that is how I thought about it at the time. And how it's, I've been thinking about it ever since. And like, I would like to rethink about this thing that I was telling myself. And so I'm curious if you have any sort of like, if that shows up in like in your work, in like a literal way too, like how you literally rewrite or retell your stories yourself when you found out that the first one was not the story that you wanted to tell yourself.\n\nDr. Lemus: I think it's just having grace for your own growth. Like grace is such a big theme for us is just like really giving yourself permission to just be where you're at now. I, that's what I tell my students. I say, wherever your relationship is with, you know, whatever, like the world it's, you know, it's not gonna always be like this. It's going to evolve. It's going to change and that's okay. You know, even your identity, right? Your relationship with your identity, that's gonna change. That's going to evolve. Nothing is stagnant. And so I think just giving yourself grace for what your story used to be. And, and, I was telling some of my students cuz we were rounding up the semester and they were like, oh I think I'm too confrontational. Cuz I, I'll call people out on too much. And I'm like, I'm too much.\n\nAnna: Oh, big narrative I see a lot.\n\nDr. Lemus: And I tell them one, you're not too much. Two, I said, I was like that when I was in my twenties and I am much more discerning now of where I put my energy, but I am so grateful to my 20 year old self for being so confrontational with people because it allowed me to set boundaries. So I think it's like, yes, I have evolved. But I'm also really grateful for those times, those things that I did, or even those stories that I would tell myself because it helped me to, to evolve, right. Those, because I got those stories out of me, then I was able to like make room to process and grow.\n\nAnna: What's so funny is that's I think the process I go through when I reread by journals, you know, I think, I think of my past self in a certain way, usually like a not very nice way and like rereading how I was telling myself the story and the time, now that leads me to like that kind of thing. Like, oh, okay. Well my new story is like, no, I didn't used to be like XYZ, negative thought. There are too many to pick from right now, you know, it was actually this. So, Christina, what would you add?\n\nDr. Rose: I was thinking of the danger of the single story, you know, this sense of that. And, and I'm, again, this world that we were raised in believes that even like we only have one narrative going on in ourselves, you know\u2026\n\nAnna: Multiplicity who? We are one, never changing person.\n\nDr. Lemus: Right, monolithic.\n\nDr. Rose: And one of the exercises that we often do is, we, week six or something in our, you know, eight week course, we'll take a look at something we wrote in week one or two. And we'll look at it from a perspective of, like, a loving adult, which we are, you know [laughs] you know, coming to that, coming back to a piece of writing from a place of grace, I love that love. And as, and, and as if we were, you know, the, the parent of the person who wrote that or the caretaker or the abuela or the elder, you know, but from a place of the love that we give to other people, you know, the love we give to those that we take care of. And so I think that's a, so that \u2026 exercise is such a shift in perspective for me too, you know, because yes, when I do go through my journals, I don't do it annually. I do do it like, probably every seven years or so. And it is a big deal and I do cry and it is, you know, it is, and it's beautiful. And it's also like heartbreaking. I'm like mija, like what the heck were you giving your energy to that person? Like, like no more, you know, it's, it's a big lesson, you know, for me. And um, and I do try to make it a ceremony too, you know, because I need, in order to come from a place of love, often I need my guides, I need my ancestors. I need the spirit world to be like around me, those who love me, you know? So that's what I would add.\n\nAnna: Before we wrapped, I was going to ask if someone was listening and just was like raring to go start scribbling where they would start. But I, I love both of the things that you just outlined, whether it's expanding on something with curiosity or writing to, to your younger self, your inner child. Those both sound like great places, so unless you have something else that you would suggest to our listeners for like one last writing prompt,\n\nDr. Lemus: One last one last writing prompts is to like, do an outline of a children's, like a children's book where you're the main character, right? Like, and what would her superpowers be or their superpowers be and what would their environment be like? And yeah.\n\nAnna: Ahhhh! That is, is so good. I, I wanna go do that like right now, but this has been such an amazing conversation. I wish it could go on for like two more hours. So thank you for, for joining me today and talking about some of my favorite things and sharing some of your beautiful insights that I wanted to go write about now. So.\n\nDr. Lemus: Thank you. Thank you for having, for having us.\n\nAnna: There\u2019s a reason I think of my later-in-life diagnosis when I think of the importance of rewriting my story or how I tell my story. It\u2019s that, like, our understanding of ourselves is always changing. Or like Dr. Rose said, we don\u2019t only have one story.

The conversation covers how the app works, how communication can deepen trust, and how it can be challenging to voice our needs.</p><br/><p>Follow Mood Ring <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/moodringshow\">@moodringshow</a></p><br/><p>Follow Anna <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/annabroges\">\u200b\u200b@annabroges</a></p><br/><p>Mood Ring is a production of American Public Media and Pizza Shark.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p><strong>Full Transcript</strong></p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: There\u2019s a word people associate with me a lot: vulnerable. Like, <em>my work is vulnerable</em> and <em>thank you for being so vulnerable</em>. And honestly? It couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I SUCK at being vulnerable.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s surprising to hear, it\u2019s not just you. I didn\u2019t know that about myself for a really long time. My therapist was kind of the first one to float the idea and I didn\u2019t really buy it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>She kept at it, though. She was not gonna take no for an answer. At some point in our work together, she looked at me and said, \u201cYou talk openly about vulnerable things, but is that the same as actually being vulnerable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>My therapist wasn\u2019t impressed by my ability to write an essay about wanting to die or to tweet my way through a depressive episode. She wanted to know: Did I ever reach out to a friend when I was feeling suicidal, or did I only tell them about it when I got through the worst of it alone? Did I cry in front of other people? Like really cry? Did I let people sit with me when I was too depressed to talk, just because I needed company? Did I ask for help?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the kind of vulnerability I struggle with\u2014because honestly? Vulnerability, in my opinion, is exposing whatever is toughest to expose. And that\u2019s what\u2019s tough for me. And whether or not you struggle with it too, or another kind of vulnerability, I figured we could all use a little guidance around how to actually ask for support when we need it.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hey I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings, even when those feelings are big and scary and you really want someone there with you.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Every episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope \u2014 with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, or with the world around us.</p><br/><p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><br/><p>Reaching out to a loved one when you need support is the type of advice you hear everywhere. We <em>know</em> that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do, but a lot of us just can\u2019t get ourselves to do it, or don\u2019t know how. Sometimes, instead of psyching yourself up to send the text or figuring out what to say in the first place, it can just feel easier to weather the storm by yourself.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s why I wanted to talk to today\u2019s guest.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah Lucas is the co-creator of the notOK app. She worked with her brother Charlie to make it easier for people to reach out to loved ones when they\u2019re, well, \u201cnot okay\u201d. And we\u2019ll get more into how the app works in our conversation, but for now I\u2019ll say: It\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that I need and what today\u2019s episode is all about: Finding ways to ask for help without <em>actually</em> having to ask for help.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Hey Hannah, I&#39;m so excited to chat.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: Hey!</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: So you created an app with your brother, so for our listeners who haven&#39;t heard of it or aren&#39;t familiar, can you just give us a little bit of history there and tell us about how it works?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: So the notOK app is essentially a digital panic button. That when pressed it alerts the user&#39;s up to five preselected trusted contacts that the user is not okay and needs help, along with the user&#39;s GPS location, just in case the trusted contacts need to physically go get them.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely, and what inspired you to create it?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: I came up for the idea for the app when I was a freshman in high school, I had just been diagnosed with a chronic illness called POTS. It stands for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. And because of this, I was passing out all the time. I was being bullied, harassed, the whole nine. And it just made me spiral really deeply into depression and anxiety. Until one night I just, I couldn&#39;t handle the pressure anymore and I had a suicide attempt, but luckily my mom saved my life that night and I&#39;m forever grateful for that. And that&#39;s when I knew, I desperately needed a tool to take my independence back from my chronic illness and my mental illness.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Thank you for sharing that, first of all. And I&#39;m, I&#39;m so glad as someone who deals with suicidal ideation and self-harm a lots always- nice isn&#39;t the word to hear, like to connect with other people who, who can relate. Like it&#39;s not nice because I hate that we can relate\u2013</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: It&#39;s comforting.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: But it\u2019s comforting. Exactly, exactly. So if someone wanted to use the notOK app, when kind of do they use it, what kind of moments is it for?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: The notOK app is a crisis tool as well as pre-crisis, my therapist and I, we like to put it this way. I rate my stress and anxiety on a scale from one to 10, one being the lowest, 10 being I need emergency services right now. So when I feel myself building up about a four or five and I just feel it rising higher and higher, I normally press the button. So it doesn&#39;t always have to get to a crisis point. But of course crises do happen, every once in a while. So the notOK app is here for that. It&#39;s here for those tough moments where you don&#39;t know the words to say, but you need help.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: So I loved what you said about how it can be really, really hard to find the literal words. Why, why, it&#39;s a big question, but like why, why is it so hard?! Like, like you, you, as you say, like, we are kind of in this \u2026 cultural moment where there is, I think a little bit more mental health literacy going around. Like we have a little bit more vocabulary, like not quite everything, but at least on social media, like but in the moment, in the moment, why is it so hard to reach out and to say, Hey, I&#39;m not okay.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: Let&#39;s face it, mental illness lies. It tells you that you&#39;re not worthy. It tells you that nobody around you cares, that you don&#39;t have people around you. So mental illness really just shuts you up and it is so difficult to break that, that silence. So I just wanted to make it as easy as possible, because sometimes it&#39;s just like, I&#39;m sitting here and like, I&#39;m so overwhelmed and I&#39;m so stressed out and I&#39;m like, I need help, but I don&#39;t know how to ask for it. You know, I don&#39;t wanna be a burden.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I&#39;m so glad you said that because one of my, perhaps more embarrassing personal questions, is if you have any tips or guidance or solidarity for people who are nervous about asking people to be their trusted contact in the first place, you know. I feel like my, my brain goes, no, you&#39;re a burden, you don&#39;t wanna like ask them to be your go-to person. That&#39;s too much. Like how do I shut that up?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: So whenever I add someone new as a trusted contact and I feel just, I just feel so anxious and I feel so nervous about it. I&#39;m like, what if they say no, this is a big responsibility. I don&#39;t wanna be a burden. But then I honestly think to myself, what would happen, like if I just wasn&#39;t in that person&#39;s life anymore? And I know that&#39;s a bad way to think about it, but it&#39;s like thinking logically about it. There would be a hole in their life, you know. Like all of my relationships, I try to keep it 50/50. So, you know, just for healthy boundaries and everything. But it&#39;s like, they would miss me, you know, like they&#39;re choosing to be in my life, they\u2019re choosing to be my friend. They&#39;re choosing to be my support. So of course, you know, they would be okay with being a trusted contact, you know, they&#39;re already putting themselves in that position for me.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely. And have you found that asking them or hitting the button and reaching out to them has brought you closer with any of your trusted contacts?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: Oh, definitely. I have to say my favorite feature of this app is when you go and initially add a trusted contact, the trusted contact actually gets a text message that says, \u201cHey, so and so added you as a trusted contact for the notOK app.\u201d And it gives them resources, and it tells them what a trusted contact is, and it tells them the responsibility and how to help the user. Which really is incredible on so many levels [Anna: yeah!] because a lot of people don&#39;t even know that their friends are struggling. And this opens up the conversation to say, \u201cHey, how can I be here for you?\u201d You know, \u201chow can we be there for each other? What&#39;s going on? You know, you don&#39;t always have to be perfect. It&#39;s okay. You know, your flaws are what make you beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah, oh, I love that it opens up a conversation because I, I wanted to ask, like, do you have any tips around how you might approach that conversation?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: Be vulnerable. It&#39;s the most difficult thing to do. But it&#39;s the most rewarding thing you can ever do in your life is just being vulnerable with the people who care about you. I\u2019m not saying spill all of your secrets! [laughs] But it is okay to show them a softer side of you, you know? I don&#39;t wanna use the word damage, but \u2026 a side of you that isn&#39;t so perfect, you know, give them that chance to love those flaws of yours, you know.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>After the break, we\u2019ll talk more with Hannah about coping with her peers and keeping it real.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC FADE OUT</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC FADE IN</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hey, welcome back. I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring. We\u2019re talking to Hannah Lucas about the app she helped create which is sort of a digital panic button and that helps you reach out to trusted friends and loved ones when you need support.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: So you&#39;re, you&#39;re gen Z. Like, so just, I was just talking to my producer, Georgie, about how, you know, when I was growing up on the internet, like the life that I was putting out there, you know, like on Instagram or on Twitter was definitely like a better view of my life, but I never felt the pressure for like perfection.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: Yeah, exactly. But it&#39;s like, I was striving so hard for, for perfection. And it&#39;s like, all you see on social media is those perfect moments. You know, you don&#39;t see those flaws. You don&#39;t see them being who they are. You see these little bits and snippets of their life. And it&#39;s like, my life isn&#39;t as exciting. You know, I&#39;m not as pretty, I&#39;m not as skinny, you know, I&#39;m not as fit, you know? It&#39;s just all those, it was a lot, it was a lot.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I wanna stick on like vulnerability for a second because I, I really love that. I&#39;m curious how you&#39;re seeing in your social spaces on social media or IRL, this move toward more vulnerability. Are you seeing it in your circles or is it something that you&#39;ve really introduced to them?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: You know, that&#39;s an interesting question. I think it&#39;s a little bit of both. My view on technology and social media it&#39;s changed drastically, but now I view it as more of a black mirror. You can find anything and everything on the internet, but it&#39;s a reflection of what you wanna see. Like, are you making the choice to follow these people who positively impact you, or are you following all the gossips and the drama and things that are just going to feed you negative energy, 24/7, you know? And with my friend group \u2026 I\u2019d say that it was kind of difficult for my friends to be real. Like, I don&#39;t even wanna say vulnerable, but, just be real with everyone and even themselves with what&#39;s going on. But, it started with a conversation. We all had to have like a little group talk, on how we can do better and be better people and really grow. And it, at the end of the day, we all had to make a choice, you know, are we going to choose to be a little bit more vulnerable? Or are we gonna strive for the impossible perfection?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: But I would love to ask about, kind of what comes after asking for help, because for me, one of, one of the things that&#39;s hard about asking for support or even getting asked for help is like, how you do that? You know, like, like literally, and I know it&#39;s different situation to situation, but do you have any tips for giving your loved ones guidance on the best way to support you in these moments of need?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: Everybody&#39;s different. But I will say have that honest trust, that honest conversation with your trusted contacts, when you first add them as a trusted contact. Work with them to figure out and create a safety plan for what to do when you&#39;re in these situations. Figure out coping mechanisms to bring you down \u2026 you know, when you&#39;ve, when you feel the pressure rising.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: I am curious if like, do you have, what are some of your hopes for the future of this kind of support and communication and being able to talk about mental health?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hannah: Honestly my dream is that this app helps people realize that mental health and mental illness isn&#39;t that big of a deal. And what I mean by that is just treating it immediately when you see the signs, you know, you don&#39;t have to deal with the stigma. Just go get help, cause that&#39;s the most important thing.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely.

            "contentSnippet": "Anna Borges interviews notOK app creator Hannah Lucas about how to get help during intense mental health moments. The conversation covers how the app works, how communication can deepen trust, and how it can be challenging to voice our needs.\n\nFollow Mood Ring @moodringshow\n\nFollow Anna \u200b\u200b@annabroges\n\nMood Ring is a production of American Public Media and Pizza Shark.\n\n\nFull Transcript\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: There\u2019s a word people associate with me a lot: vulnerable. Like, my work is vulnerable and thank you for being so vulnerable. And honestly? It couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I SUCK at being vulnerable.\n\n\u00a0\nIf that\u2019s surprising to hear, it\u2019s not just you. I didn\u2019t know that about myself for a really long time. My therapist was kind of the first one to float the idea and I didn\u2019t really buy it.\n\n\u00a0\nShe kept at it, though. She was not gonna take no for an answer. At some point in our work together, she looked at me and said, \u201cYou talk openly about vulnerable things, but is that the same as actually being vulnerable?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nTHEME MUSIC\n\n\u00a0\nMy therapist wasn\u2019t impressed by my ability to write an essay about wanting to die or to tweet my way through a depressive episode. She wanted to know: Did I ever reach out to a friend when I was feeling suicidal, or did I only tell them about it when I got through the worst of it alone? Did I cry in front of other people? Like really cry? Did I let people sit with me when I was too depressed to talk, just because I needed company? Did I ask for help?\n\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the kind of vulnerability I struggle with\u2014because honestly? Vulnerability, in my opinion, is exposing whatever is toughest to expose. And that\u2019s what\u2019s tough for me. And whether or not you struggle with it too, or another kind of vulnerability, I figured we could all use a little guidance around how to actually ask for support when we need it.\n\n\u00a0\nHey I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings, even when those feelings are big and scary and you really want someone there with you.\n\n\u00a0\nEvery episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope \u2014 with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, or with the world around us.\n\n\u00a0\n\nReaching out to a loved one when you need support is the type of advice you hear everywhere. We know that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do, but a lot of us just can\u2019t get ourselves to do it, or don\u2019t know how. Sometimes, instead of psyching yourself up to send the text or figuring out what to say in the first place, it can just feel easier to weather the storm by yourself.\n\n\u00a0\nSo that\u2019s why I wanted to talk to today\u2019s guest.\n\n\u00a0\nHannah Lucas is the co-creator of the notOK app. She worked with her brother Charlie to make it easier for people to reach out to loved ones when they\u2019re, well, \u201cnot okay\u201d. And we\u2019ll get more into how the app works in our conversation, but for now I\u2019ll say: It\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that I need and what today\u2019s episode is all about: Finding ways to ask for help without actually having to ask for help.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Hey Hannah, I'm so excited to chat.\n\n\u00a0\nHannah: Hey!\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: So you created an app with your brother, so for our listeners who haven't heard of it or aren't familiar, can you just give us a little bit of history there and tell us about how it works?\n\n\u00a0\nHannah: So the notOK app is essentially a digital panic button. That when pressed it alerts the user's up to five preselected trusted contacts that the user is not okay and needs help, along with the user's GPS location, just in case the trusted contacts need to physically go get them.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Absolutely, and what inspired you to create it?\n\n\u00a0\nHannah: I came up for the idea for the app when I was a freshman in high school, I had just been diagnosed with a chronic illness called POTS. It stands for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. And because of this, I was passing out all the time. I was being bullied, harassed, the whole nine. And it just made me spiral really deeply into depression and anxiety. Until one night I just, I couldn't handle the pressure anymore and I had a suicide attempt, but luckily my mom saved my life that night and I'm forever grateful for that. And that's when I knew, I desperately needed a tool to take my independence back from my chronic illness and my mental illness.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Thank you for sharing that, first of all. And I'm, I'm so glad as someone who deals with suicidal ideation and self-harm a lots always- nice isn't the word to hear, like to connect with other people who, who can relate. Like it's not nice because I hate that we can relate\u2013\n\n\u00a0\nHannah: It's comforting.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: But it\u2019s comforting. Exactly, exactly. So if someone wanted to use the notOK app, when kind of do they use it, what kind of moments is it for?\n\n\u00a0\nHannah: The notOK app is a crisis tool as well as pre-crisis, my therapist and I, we like to put it this way. I rate my stress and anxiety on a scale from one to 10, one being the lowest, 10 being I need emergency services right now. So when I feel myself building up about a four or five and I just feel it rising higher and higher, I normally press the button. So it doesn't always have to get to a crisis point. But of course crises do happen, every once in a while. So the notOK app is here for that. It's here for those tough moments where you don't know the words to say, but you need help.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: So I loved what you said about how it can be really, really hard to find the literal words. Why, why, it's a big question, but like why, why is it so hard?! Like, like you, you, as you say, like, we are kind of in this \u2026 cultural moment where there is, I think a little bit more mental health literacy going around. Like we have a little bit more vocabulary, like not quite everything, but at least on social media, like but in the moment, in the moment, why is it so hard to reach out and to say, Hey, I'm not okay.\n\n\u00a0\nHannah: Let's face it, mental illness lies. It tells you that you're not worthy. It tells you that nobody around you cares, that you don't have people around you. So mental illness really just shuts you up and it is so difficult to break that, that silence. So I just wanted to make it as easy as possible, because sometimes it's just like, I'm sitting here and like, I'm so overwhelmed and I'm so stressed out and I'm like, I need help, but I don't know how to ask for it. You know, I don't wanna be a burden.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: I'm so glad you said that because one of my, perhaps more embarrassing personal questions, is if you have any tips or guidance or solidarity for people who are nervous about asking people to be their trusted contact in the first place, you know. I feel like my, my brain goes, no, you're a burden, you don't wanna like ask them to be your go-to person. That's too much. Like how do I shut that up?\n\n\u00a0\nHannah: So whenever I add someone new as a trusted contact and I feel just, I just feel so anxious and I feel so nervous about it. I'm like, what if they say no, this is a big responsibility. I don't wanna be a burden. But then I honestly think to myself, what would happen, like if I just wasn't in that person's life anymore? And I know that's a bad way to think about it, but it's like thinking logically about it. There would be a hole in their life, you know. Like all of my relationships, I try to keep it 50/50. So, you know, just for healthy boundaries and everything. But it's like, they would miss me, you know, like they're choosing to be in my life, they\u2019re choosing to be my friend. They're choosing to be my support. So of course, you know, they would be okay with being a trusted contact, you know, they're already putting themselves in that position for me.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna: Absolutely. And have you found that asking them or hitting the button and reaching out to them has brought you closer with any of your trusted contacts?\n\n\u00a0\nHannah: Oh, definitely. I have to say my favorite feature of this app is when you go and initially add a trusted contact, the trusted contact actually gets a text message that says, \u201cHey, so and so added you as a trusted contact for the notOK app.\u201d And it gives them resources, and it tells them what a trusted contact is, and it tells them the responsibility and how to help the user.

And as my wax tech was like painfully ripping the hair off my body, I thought, &quot;Huh, it&#39;s so nice to be touched by another human again.&quot;</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t realize that I was lonely or could really stand to have been fucked or cuddled \u2014 I live alone and I&#39;m single, so during the height of pandemic lockdown, I was \u2026 very, very isolated. But it wasn&#39;t until I felt this visceral rush of relief when I typically felt excruciating pain that I realized, Oh, I needed this.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Like, actually needed it. Because when I say I was touch starved, I\u2019m not being cute or\u00a0 dramatic. Tough starvation is a real thing. It\u2019s also known as skin hunger or touch deprivation, but whatever you call it, we know that going for too long without human touch has real psychological effects. Starting with when we bond with our caregivers through touch when we\u2019re infants, we\u2019re wired to need touch, for our development and for our mental health.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So what do we do when we\u2019re not getting any?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hey, I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings, even when you\u2019re feeling so untouched like a 2007 pop song.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Every episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope\u2014with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, or with the world around us.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Today we\u2019re talking about cuddling with your friends, which might seem like kind of a leap from a bikini wax. But that&#39;s because I didn\u2019t know until the last minute that I wanted this episode to be about cuddling your friends. Before that, I knew I wanted to do something on touch starvation, and, you know, ways to scratch that itch. We thought of massages, or loving self-touch and yep, getting waxed, but, you know, none of them really felt right. Because sure, all of that involves getting touched, but none of it is <em>intimacy. </em>And I was missing intimacy as much as I was missing the touch itself.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And then I had this exchange on Twitter.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>SOUND OF KEYBOARD TYPING</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I was doing what I do\u2014AKA tweeting about whatever thought comes into my head and conveniently forgetting that my family and coworkers follow me\u2014and I was basically like, \u201cHey, show of hands, who else hasn&#39;t had real physical intimacy since the Before Times?&quot;</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And lots of people chimed in and long story short, the tweet led to some talk about why platonic intimacy isn\u2019t more of a thing. Like, why is so much non-sexual touch still reserved mostly for sexual and romantic partners?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>And one of the people who chimed in is actually one of today\u2019s guests.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>I slid into his DMs like, \u201cHey, want to platonically cuddle?\u201d and by that I mean, \u201cDo you want to come on my podcast?\u201d And thankfully, he said yes.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zachary Zane is a writer who mostly focuses on sex and bisexuality in his work. He\u2019s behind the erotic nonficiton zine Boyslut and is a columnist for Men\u2019s Health. And most importantly, he\u2019s someone who, quite frankly, seemed to have a lot of platonic intimacy in his life. So, I wanted us to learn from him together.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Oh, I&#39;m so excited to chat today! Were you luckier than I was during the pandemic and, like, got plenty of touch? What, what was it like for you?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: Um, I- initially, no, I did not get any touch whatsoever and that was not fun as I, as you can imagine. And then I actually, one of the few people that managed to find love during the pandemic, which I know is probably problematic to say. But uh-</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: I hate you. I&#39;m so jealous.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: And, and then, so we kind of cuddled up together. So I had a primary partner who I was able to see and cuddle with, towards the kind of end of it. Cause there was that lull kind of the middle, during the summer where I was like, okay, I feel safe meeting people, and that&#39;s when I met them. And then we kind of went back into lockdown and then we were with each other. So I was very lucky.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Ugh. Oh, and for our listeners who aren&#39;t familiar with, like ethical non-monogamy and polyamory, can you just give like a quick one liner on like what you mean when you say primary partner?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: Sure. So primary partner for me, I \u2026 it, it just like, I actually practice, like, non-hierarchical poly, but so maybe saying primary is not the correct term. So essentially when you have multiple partners, this is kind of like, for me in the sense was kind of the, the main one that I was kind of hanging out with, the main one who I&#39;m in love with, the one who I call my boyfriend. And then I kind of have more casual partners, which are almost like, honestly, friends with benefits. Although poly people just kind of love putting terms to absolutely everything, unnecessarily. But, so this was more the person who I&#39;d spend my time with more consistently.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Got it. Got it. And I love, I love that you say friends with benefits because immediately my brain goes, okay, well, this episode is about cuddling your friends. First, I would love to just hear about your experience with platonic intimacy and how, and what that means for you and what it looks like in your life.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: I think I&#39;m very \u2026 lucky that I&#39;ve been able to have it, but I&#39;m able to have it because I am queer. And I recognize that, where cuddling with another man platonically, I feel like it&#39;s much more accepted in the gay community, in the queer community, than if I was completely straight. And then I think it would just be more challenging if, you know, if you&#39;re straight, you have to be really comfortable with your masculinity to be able to platonically cuddle another straight friend.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Hmm, absolutely. What kind of experiences have you had in this area?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: Yeah. And I really think in that regard, it&#39;s more like relationship anarchy. Again, there are a million terms and I know it&#39;s annoying, but kind of relationship anarchy, one of the\u00a0 key \u2026 parts of that is the idea that you don&#39;t prioritize kind of romantic relationships over your friendships and your friendships can be equally as important and equally as fulfilling, even though you&#39;re not sexual, even if you\u2019re not in, in a romantic relationship. And I kinda love that about relationship anarchy.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: But I\u2019m curious how you, if you ever had the expectation that touch and physical intimacy was only for romantic partners and if you had to release the expectation of that and accept that it could be with platonic relationships, or if it\u2019s always been that way for you?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: No, I think I definitely had this idea that \u2026 you know, touch, whether it&#39;s cuddling, or touch that extends beyond sex, was definitely still for romantic relationships or sexual relationships. I think the only exception is when you were, like, sad or crying. Is, if I&#39;m looking back on it, it&#39;s when you&#39;re crying. That was the only time it was kind of more acceptable to have these elements of platonic touch as a means of comfort. Like why do I have to reach a point of such despair in order to, for it to be socially acceptable for me to have platonic touch. But I really think, the thing that changed was, again, I- was being queer, and just, I was part of this community where people were platonic touching. Being like, Hey, let&#39;s cuddle, let&#39;s get in a bed or just holding each other or in a way that was just the norm \u2026 or definitely more of the norm in a way that wasn&#39;t weird or necessarily sexual.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Absolutely. So it does sound like you have, like, no lack of channels for platonic intimacy.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: No I 100% agree, but I also wanna be like, I&#39;m in the minority and I&#39;m very lucky to have this, and I&#39;m lucky to have my friends and my community and my partners. And again, it&#39;s all part of the queer and poly world, and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been able to get this.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>After a break, we\u2019ll get some advice for listeners who might be ready to snuggle up with their friends but don\u2019t know how to ask, so stay tuned.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring, I\u2019m Anna Borges. Let\u2019s get back to my conversation with sex writer and activist Zachary Zane about cuddling our friends.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: So, I&#39;m curious if you would have any advice for listeners who aren&#39;t in these communities, but who might wanna take some of this wisdom to apply to their friendship. And they&#39;re like, I really want platonic intimacy, but as you called out, unless you&#39;re in a space where that&#39;s normalized and acceptable, it could be really awkward.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: I\u2019m, I&#39;m always just a fan of asking for what you want and then being, the key about asking for what you want being okay with rejection and not being weird. That\u2019s the key to asking for what you want, is being super okay with rejection, not making it weird when they get awkward or uncomfortable. Cause they&#39;ve never been asked that question before. And they might just say no, because like they&#39;re like, no, no. And then they might come back being like, actually that sounds really nice. So just, the key is in how you take their rejection or they might be like, Hey! Actually, yeah, I\u2019m really touched starved, too. And especially now, I think because of the pandemic, it actually creates more of an entry point than potentially what you&#39;ve had before, because you&#39;re like, I had no touch for two years completely and I\u2019m starved for it. Makes it an easier entry point, I think.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Yeah. And, and that&#39;s on, even on the physical side, and on the emotional side, it does involve being vulnerable and admitting like, Hey, I&#39;m seeking something because I lack it. And I&#39;m lonely. Or I, you know, I wonder if, because this is so normalized in your circles, if you still deal with that or if you ever did, or if it&#39;s something that&#39;s come with practice.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: I, I mean, I think it&#39;s scary. I think anytime being vulnerable or intimate or expressing, Hey, I, I miss being touched like, it is a challenging thing for a lot of people to admit. I mean, hopefully you&#39;re doing this with friends who you trust, who you feel. That&#39;s the point of friendship to be, you&#39;re allowed to be vulnerable. You&#39;re allowed to be intimate. You&#39;re allowed to share your darkest desires. They&#39;re here to support you. They&#39;re here to help you. So kind of let them do that. And I think it&#39;s one of those things that&#39;s actually, so everyone wins from this.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Absolutely. Oh! So before we wrap, because we&#39;ve had such an emphasis on like the importance of communication and I&#39;m loving all the takeaways, I was wondering if we could walk through, which we&#39;ve touched on a little bit so far, but a script for listeners to take away, like, hey, they want to make an ask for the first time of one of their friends. What exactly might they say?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: I think it&#39;s better to air on the side of being more blunt and direct. And I think, being blunt and direct is almost a learning curve, and then receiving someone being blunt and direct is a learning curve, but it gets easier. When you just kind of express what it is that you want very clearly where there\u2019s no ambiguity, and that way they know what they&#39;re getting into, they are fully consenting with the knowledge of everything that you&#39;ve told them and what this is gonna be. So I understand that this sounds on the side of maybe blunter than you would like, and you can always soften it yourself. But I think something along the lines of like, Hey, I have a question for you. I&#39;ve just been really starved for touch right now, and really all of COVID. And so I was wondering if you&#39;d be open to cuddling a bit. I just miss being held and holding people. And I really trust you, and would love to do this with you. And then if you want, you can literally throw out at the end, I promise no funny business.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: [laughs] The little kicker. Oh, I love that. That doesn&#39;t feel too blunt. That feels very vulnerable, compassionate and also complimentary. Complimentary? Complimentary.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: Yeah, no, I think it&#39;s that. I think you&#39;re, you&#39;re expressing your vulnerability and, and desire for intimacy in a way that \u2026 again, 99% of us crave the same thing. So this is a universal desire. If you wanted something completely out there, okay, then it&#39;s a different conversation. But I think if anyone, you know, they can easily empathize, sympathize or odds are, are craving the same thing. So you&#39;re not alone in your desires.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Absolutely, ugh. And that, I think, is a beautiful note to end on. So thank you so much for this lovely conversation.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: Awesome, thank you so much.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: And where can people find you if they wanna see more of your work?</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zach Zane: So, my website\u2019s always greatzacharyzane.com.

Just know that I am extremely shadow banned on Instagram, so you have to type in my whole name and handle to be able to find me.

Exactly.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So how many of you listened to Zachary\u2019s script and can\u2019t imagine being that vulnerable and straightforward? Because I feel you.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>But the thing is, Zachary was so right when he said that this need for intimacy is universal, especially right now when so many of us are more disconnected than we\u2019ve ever been. It might feel exposing to put yourself out there like that, but hey, when I think about getting that message from the other side of things? That kind of request is one I would be so thrilled to receive.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>So maybe we can all be a little braver about initiating the intimacy we want to see in the world?

            "contentSnippet": "Host Anna Borges interviews guest Zachary Zane about platonic intimacy.\n\nFollow Mood Ring @moodringshow\n\nFollow Anna \u200b\u200b@annabroges\n\nMood Ring is a production of American Public Media and Pizza Shark.\n\nFull Transcript\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: The first time I realized I was touch starved during the pandemic is when the world started opening up and one of the first things I did was go and get a wax for the first time. And as my wax tech was like painfully ripping the hair off my body, I thought, \"Huh, it's so nice to be touched by another human again.\"\n\n\u00a0\nIt's not that I didn't realize that I was lonely or could really stand to have been fucked or cuddled \u2014 I live alone and I'm single, so during the height of pandemic lockdown, I was \u2026 very, very isolated. But it wasn't until I felt this visceral rush of relief when I typically felt excruciating pain that I realized, Oh, I needed this.\n\n\u00a0\nLike, actually needed it. Because when I say I was touch starved, I\u2019m not being cute or\u00a0 dramatic. Tough starvation is a real thing. It\u2019s also known as skin hunger or touch deprivation, but whatever you call it, we know that going for too long without human touch has real psychological effects. Starting with when we bond with our caregivers through touch when we\u2019re infants, we\u2019re wired to need touch, for our development and for our mental health.\n\n\u00a0\nSo what do we do when we\u2019re not getting any?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHey, I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings, even when you\u2019re feeling so untouched like a 2007 pop song.\n\n\u00a0\nEvery episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope\u2014with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, or with the world around us.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Today we\u2019re talking about cuddling with your friends, which might seem like kind of a leap from a bikini wax. But that's because I didn\u2019t know until the last minute that I wanted this episode to be about cuddling your friends. Before that, I knew I wanted to do something on touch starvation, and, you know, ways to scratch that itch. We thought of massages, or loving self-touch and yep, getting waxed, but, you know, none of them really felt right. Because sure, all of that involves getting touched, but none of it is intimacy. And I was missing intimacy as much as I was missing the touch itself.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd then I had this exchange on Twitter.\n\n\u00a0\nSOUND OF KEYBOARD TYPING\n\n\u00a0\nI was doing what I do\u2014AKA tweeting about whatever thought comes into my head and conveniently forgetting that my family and coworkers follow me\u2014and I was basically like, \u201cHey, show of hands, who else hasn't had real physical intimacy since the Before Times?\"\n\n\u00a0\nAnd lots of people chimed in and long story short, the tweet led to some talk about why platonic intimacy isn\u2019t more of a thing. Like, why is so much non-sexual touch still reserved mostly for sexual and romantic partners?\n\n\u00a0\nAnd one of the people who chimed in is actually one of today\u2019s guests.\n\n\u00a0\nI slid into his DMs like, \u201cHey, want to platonically cuddle?\u201d and by that I mean, \u201cDo you want to come on my podcast?\u201d And thankfully, he said yes.\n\n\u00a0\nZachary Zane is a writer who mostly focuses on sex and bisexuality in his work. He\u2019s behind the erotic nonficiton zine Boyslut and is a columnist for Men\u2019s Health. And most importantly, he\u2019s someone who, quite frankly, seemed to have a lot of platonic intimacy in his life. So, I wanted us to learn from him together.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Oh, I'm so excited to chat today! Were you luckier than I was during the pandemic and, like, got plenty of touch? What, what was it like for you?\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: Um, I- initially, no, I did not get any touch whatsoever and that was not fun as I, as you can imagine. And then I actually, one of the few people that managed to find love during the pandemic, which I know is probably problematic to say. But uh-\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: I hate you. I'm so jealous.\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: And, and then, so we kind of cuddled up together. So I had a primary partner who I was able to see and cuddle with, towards the kind of end of it. Cause there was that lull kind of the middle, during the summer where I was like, okay, I feel safe meeting people, and that's when I met them. And then we kind of went back into lockdown and then we were with each other. So I was very lucky.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Ugh. Oh, and for our listeners who aren't familiar with, like ethical non-monogamy and polyamory, can you just give like a quick one liner on like what you mean when you say primary partner?\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: Sure. So primary partner for me, I \u2026 it, it just like, I actually practice, like, non-hierarchical poly, but so maybe saying primary is not the correct term. So essentially when you have multiple partners, this is kind of like, for me in the sense was kind of the, the main one that I was kind of hanging out with, the main one who I'm in love with, the one who I call my boyfriend. And then I kind of have more casual partners, which are almost like, honestly, friends with benefits. Although poly people just kind of love putting terms to absolutely everything, unnecessarily. But, so this was more the person who I'd spend my time with more consistently.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Got it. Got it. And I love, I love that you say friends with benefits because immediately my brain goes, okay, well, this episode is about cuddling your friends. First, I would love to just hear about your experience with platonic intimacy and how, and what that means for you and what it looks like in your life.\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: I think I'm very \u2026 lucky that I've been able to have it, but I'm able to have it because I am queer. And I recognize that, where cuddling with another man platonically, I feel like it's much more accepted in the gay community, in the queer community, than if I was completely straight. And then I think it would just be more challenging if, you know, if you're straight, you have to be really comfortable with your masculinity to be able to platonically cuddle another straight friend.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Hmm, absolutely. What kind of experiences have you had in this area?\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: Yeah. And I really think in that regard, it's more like relationship anarchy. Again, there are a million terms and I know it's annoying, but kind of relationship anarchy, one of the\u00a0 key \u2026 parts of that is the idea that you don't prioritize kind of romantic relationships over your friendships and your friendships can be equally as important and equally as fulfilling, even though you're not sexual, even if you\u2019re not in, in a romantic relationship. And I kinda love that about relationship anarchy.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: But I\u2019m curious how you, if you ever had the expectation that touch and physical intimacy was only for romantic partners and if you had to release the expectation of that and accept that it could be with platonic relationships, or if it\u2019s always been that way for you?\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: No, I think I definitely had this idea that \u2026 you know, touch, whether it's cuddling, or touch that extends beyond sex, was definitely still for romantic relationships or sexual relationships. I think the only exception is when you were, like, sad or crying. Is, if I'm looking back on it, it's when you're crying. That was the only time it was kind of more acceptable to have these elements of platonic touch as a means of comfort. Like why do I have to reach a point of such despair in order to, for it to be socially acceptable for me to have platonic touch. But I really think, the thing that changed was, again, I- was being queer, and just, I was part of this community where people were platonic touching. Being like, Hey, let's cuddle, let's get in a bed or just holding each other or in a way that was just the norm \u2026 or definitely more of the norm in a way that wasn't weird or necessarily sexual.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Absolutely. So it does sound like you have, like, no lack of channels for platonic intimacy.\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: No I 100% agree, but I also wanna be like, I'm in the minority and I'm very lucky to have this, and I'm lucky to have my friends and my community and my partners. And again, it's all part of the queer and poly world, and that's why I've been able to get this.\n\n\u00a0\nAfter a break, we\u2019ll get some advice for listeners who might be ready to snuggle up with their friends but don\u2019t know how to ask, so stay tuned.\n\n\u00a0\nMIDROLL\n\n\u00a0\nHey, welcome back to Mood Ring, I\u2019m Anna Borges. Let\u2019s get back to my conversation with sex writer and activist Zachary Zane about cuddling our friends.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: So, I'm curious if you would have any advice for listeners who aren't in these communities, but who might wanna take some of this wisdom to apply to their friendship. And they're like, I really want platonic intimacy, but as you called out, unless you're in a space where that's normalized and acceptable, it could be really awkward.\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: I\u2019m, I'm always just a fan of asking for what you want and then being, the key about asking for what you want being okay with rejection and not being weird. That\u2019s the key to asking for what you want, is being super okay with rejection, not making it weird when they get awkward or uncomfortable. Cause they've never been asked that question before. And they might just say no, because like they're like, no, no. And then they might come back being like, actually that sounds really nice. So just, the key is in how you take their rejection or they might be like, Hey! Actually, yeah, I\u2019m really touched starved, too. And especially now, I think because of the pandemic, it actually creates more of an entry point than potentially what you've had before, because you're like, I had no touch for two years completely and I\u2019m starved for it. Makes it an easier entry point, I think.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Yeah. And, and that's on, even on the physical side, and on the emotional side, it does involve being vulnerable and admitting like, Hey, I'm seeking something because I lack it. And I'm lonely. Or I, you know, I wonder if, because this is so normalized in your circles, if you still deal with that or if you ever did, or if it's something that's come with practice.\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: I, I mean, I think it's scary. I think anytime being vulnerable or intimate or expressing, Hey, I, I miss being touched like, it is a challenging thing for a lot of people to admit. I mean, hopefully you're doing this with friends who you trust, who you feel. That's the point of friendship to be, you're allowed to be vulnerable. You're allowed to be intimate. You're allowed to share your darkest desires. They're here to support you. They're here to help you. So kind of let them do that. And I think it's one of those things that's actually, so everyone wins from this.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Absolutely. Oh! So before we wrap, because we've had such an emphasis on like the importance of communication and I'm loving all the takeaways, I was wondering if we could walk through, which we've touched on a little bit so far, but a script for listeners to take away, like, hey, they want to make an ask for the first time of one of their friends. What exactly might they say?\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: I think it's better to air on the side of being more blunt and direct. And I think, being blunt and direct is almost a learning curve, and then receiving someone being blunt and direct is a learning curve, but it gets easier. When you just kind of express what it is that you want very clearly where there\u2019s no ambiguity, and that way they know what they're getting into, they are fully consenting with the knowledge of everything that you've told them and what this is gonna be. So I understand that this sounds on the side of maybe blunter than you would like, and you can always soften it yourself. But I think something along the lines of like, Hey, I have a question for you. I've just been really starved for touch right now, and really all of COVID. And so I was wondering if you'd be open to cuddling a bit. I just miss being held and holding people. And I really trust you, and would love to do this with you. And then if you want, you can literally throw out at the end, I promise no funny business.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: [laughs] The little kicker. Oh, I love that. That doesn't feel too blunt. That feels very vulnerable, compassionate and also complimentary. Complimentary? Complimentary.\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: Yeah, no, I think it's that. I think you're, you're expressing your vulnerability and, and desire for intimacy in a way that \u2026 again, 99% of us crave the same thing. So this is a universal desire. If you wanted something completely out there, okay, then it's a different conversation. But I think if anyone, you know, they can easily empathize, sympathize or odds are, are craving the same thing. So you're not alone in your desires.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Absolutely, ugh. And that, I think, is a beautiful note to end on. So thank you so much for this lovely conversation.\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: Awesome, thank you so much.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: And where can people find you if they wanna see more of your work?\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: So, my website\u2019s always greatzacharyzane.com. Or Twitter and Instagram, both as zacharyzane_. So z-a-c-h-a-r-y-z-a-n-e underscore. Just know that I am extremely shadow banned on Instagram, so you have to type in my whole name and handle to be able to find me. But that is because I post hot and sexy photos along with hot and sexy content. So, so, hopefully you guys will enjoy it.\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: See, it'll be worth the effort spelling the whole thing out.\n\n\u00a0\nZach Zane: Exaaaaactly. Exactly.\n\n\u00a0\nSo how many of you listened to Zachary\u2019s script and can\u2019t imagine being that vulnerable and straightforward? Because I feel you.\n\n\u00a0\nBut the thing is, Zachary was so right when he said that this need for intimacy is universal, especially right now when so many of us are more disconnected than we\u2019ve ever been.

The host shares clips submitted by listeners describing how they deal with the onset of a negative mental health moment.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: I want you to picture something for me. Feel free to settle in and close your eyes.</p><br/><p>Think about what it\u2019s like to have a \u2026 common cold. Think about how your body aches. How heavy your limbs are. How runny or stuffed up your nose is. [Sound of sloshing water] Think of that underwater sensation in your head, how out of it you feel.</p><br/><p>Now picture what you do to take care of yourself when you have a cold. What makes you feel better? What foods and drinks do you gravitate toward? Warm soup. Ginger Ale. Toast. A mug of tea. And, what do you do? Maybe you go straight back to bed. Maybe take a shower and change into clean pajamas. Maybe you drag the coziest blankets to the couch and burrito up. What shows do you watch? Who do you text? What supplies do you gather? The whole ritual.</p><br/><p>Now I want you to think about a moment when you weren\u2019t feeling so hot mentally. Choose a type of moment that comes up occasionally, like a cold does. Something that\u2019s no fun, but something familiar. Maybe there are times when you\u2019re so frustrated by work you could scream. Maybe there are weekends that you don\u2019t have any plans and feel extra lonely. Maybe sometimes your to-do list reaches a certain point \u2026 that you can feel nothing but overwhelmed. Or maybe you don\u2019t have a specific moment or reason\u2014maybe sometimes your sadness or anxiety or hurt or pain just flares up, and you know you\u2019re in for a rough day.</p><br/><p>Whatever situation you choose, remember what it\u2019s like, how you felt.</p><br/><p>Did you know what to reach for? Did you know what would make you feel better? Did you know what you really needed in that moment?</p><br/><p>For a long time, I didn\u2019t. A lot of the time. We know what to do when we\u2019re sick. Why do we know so much less about what to do when we\u2019re angry? Or sad? Or lonely? Or overwhelmed? Or anything?</p><br/><p>Why don\u2019t we have a plan for that?</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>Hey, I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings...even when you\u2019re not exactly sure what will make you feel better. Every episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope\u2014with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, or with the world around us.</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: This episode, we\u2019re kind of cheating\u2014we\u2019re not exploring just one new way to cope. We\u2019re exploring, like, a whole ass coping <em>kit</em>. Because it doesn\u2019t matter how many self-care tips you know. Like, when you feel something strongly or you\u2019re in that moment when you\u2019re upset or pissed off or in your feelings, it can be hard to access the tools that exist in your head, and remember what makes you feel better.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s where this thing I like to call a coping kit comes in.</p><br/><p>Sounds fancy maybe but, really building a coping kit just means making a plan, and having a set of go-to tools or activities at the ready so you don\u2019t have to worry about it when you\u2019re in a bad place. You just go, okay, that is what I do when I feel this way. A coping kit is about making it as easy as possible for Future You to take care of yourself in moments when it\u2019s not easy to remember how the fuck to take care of yourself.</p><br/><p>So, let\u2019s talk about how to make one. For help on this, I put out a call on social media because no two coping kits are the same. And I don\u2019t just mean what\u2019s in it. I also mean how it comes to life.</p><br/><p>Anonymous: \u201cMy coping mechanism, which a lot of people actually judge, but, has been to sort of like post funny Instagram stories.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kevin: \u201cPretty much anything off of Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s Emotion album. I do a lot of finger-pointing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anonymous: \u201cI tell my spouse I&#39;m going to go flop, which is code for this state of sort of like, I don&#39;t care and don&#39;t expect any level of productivity or substantial response from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anonymous: \u201cI actually also do jigsaw puzzles online. I think they\u2019re a really good way for me to focus on one thing, without having to think about the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pooja: \u201cI\u2019ll do like two reps on the leg press just to get some blood flowing, and then I&#39;ll come back up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: As you just heard, there\u2019s no one way to make a coping kit. Our producer, Georgie, has a physical box of things that she reaches for. And yours can be whatever\u2014a beautiful spread in a bullet journal, a list on your phone\u2019s app. Just make sure it exists somewhere outside your head.</p><br/><p>So, how do you get started?</p><br/><p>First things first, you have to know what your coping kit is for, since it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all kinda deal. I personally have several kinds of coping kits and I keep track of them in a spreadsheet. If we\u2019re sticking with the whole sick metaphor, what you need when you have a cold is different from what you need when you have the stomach flu. And what you need when you\u2019re pissed at your boss is probably different than what you need when you\u2019re spiraling about climate anxiety.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to get hyper-specific with the situation like that though. A lot of the time, it\u2019s enough to start with the feeling you want to make a plan for dealing with. A coping kit for anxious moments. For frustrated ones. For insecure ones. Whatever feels like a good place to start. Whatever feeling or situation you build your kit for, the central question is basically, \u201cWhat do I need when I feel that way?\u201d</p><br/><p>And if you\u2019re like, ugh, I have no idea? Don\u2019t worry. I have a few categories that might help get your juices flowing, plus we have plenty more examples from my cast of coping kit volunteers. We\u2019ll get into it all after a short break.</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring! This is Anna Borges. Before the break we were talking about identifying the feelings that we want to soothe with our coping kits. So, now let\u2019s get to actually building one.</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Think again, before we get started, of that moment or situation or feeling that you want to make a game plan for that\u2019s really helpful to have at the back of your mind. Whatever theme you landed on. So like I mentioned, when I\u2019m brainstorming a new coping kit, I tend to think about it in terms of a couple of different categories.</p><br/><p>The first big bucket that I tend to start with is, well, literal things. Physical objects, tangible items that you can touch or use or wear or see or feel. They might be things that engage my senses\u2014you know like a really soft blanket to curl up in, or \u2026 an aromatherapy neck pillow I can throw in the microwave and get all warm and toasty. And I also think of comfort objects, like photos that bring up happy memories or a sentimental stuffed animal.</p><br/><p>One of my favorite object-related ideas that I got from my callout was pretty unexpected\u2014lightbulbs. It just goes to show that these kits are very personal and specific.</p><br/><p>Anonymous: I have a couple of things that I do to cope when I&#39;ve had a bad day at work or when I&#39;m just not feeling very good and I don&#39;t want to get out of bed or something like that. I really enjoy, I got the Phillips hue, like, the colored LED lights and I set up a scene based on a sunset photo I took at the beach years ago. And it was just my favorite spot and it is my favorite, like, blend of warm lighting. And, that has helped me so much because I can just transport my back there to those warm moments.</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: The next kind of umbrella category is activities. And that is a very wide umbrella, but consider that soothing activities, distracting activities, fun activities, relaxing activities, just any activity that has the power to change your mood for the better.</p><br/><p>My coping kits tend to be pretty heavy on activities, you know across the board. I think I&#39;m probably not alone in that because we got a lot of fun activities-related submissions. So I\u2019m just gonna go ahead and jump into there because I like them better than mine. [laughs]</p><br/><p>Anne: When I feel out of control, or depressed in a really restless way, the thing that will always make me feel better is cleaning. I will do my dishes, which is my least favorite thing to do, but I&#39;ll put on a really trashy podcast while I do them. Or I&#39;ll sweep, which I love because I find it very fulfilling to see all of the amount of like dust and dirt and grime coming together and being disposed of.</p><br/><p>Anonymous: When I feel overwhelmed with everything that&#39;s going on in my life and trying to plan for the future, I take a walk over the Manhattan bridge. From my apartment to the bridge is a 30 minute walk. And over the bridge is another 30 minutes. I get 60 minutes to myself to clear my head, to think about my current state, and to think about my future state. I do not listen to a podcast, I do not listen to an audio book. I typically listen to instrumental music, or actually some booty shaking hit,s just to get the creative juices flowing. And I immediately feel better having that time to truly clear my head, be in nature, and get moving.</p><br/><p>Anonymous: I experience intrusive thoughts that suggest I do very bad things to myself. So, in the bad thoughts space, I pull out a few of my favorite responses to the yuck! Taking a super hot shower. I invested a couple of years ago in a teakwood shower bench so I can sit down, but not on the floor, which feels, like, too sad for me. This way, I&#39;m able to relax more muscles and just kind of be in the steam, like, highly recommend this one.</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: We also got a lot of submissions around activities like exercise or arts and crafts and hobbies. Playing with pets was a big one, too. Really just anything that keeps you occupied.</p><br/><p>The next thing might be more of a subcategory within activities, rather than its own category, but I like to call it out separately. And I&#39;m thinking of activities like therapeutic exercises. You know, specific meditations, workbooks, that kind of thing.</p><br/><p>Some therapeutic activities might have a higher barrier to entry than others though, especially if you don\u2019t have access to a therapist or if you feel intimidated by some of the stuff you find online. But one did come up a few times in our submissions: positive self-talk and coping statements. Or, you know, talking to yourself.</p><br/><p>Bonnie: I struggle with OCD, and one of my coping mechanisms lately is an affirmation where I basically just tell myself \u2026 this too shall pass. And that I look back at other times where I&#39;ve been, in this situation before and I&#39;ve overcome it. And looking back at those times reminds me that I can overcome the struggles now, like I did then.</p><br/><p>Anonymous: First, I kind of just say to myself, like, it&#39;s okay. It&#39;s okay. Because as basic and simple as that sounds like it is okay. It&#39;s not a life or death situation. I can figure out a way to solve it.</p><br/><p>Anonymous: I speak kindly to myself. I catch the mean words in my head and I hold them softly. I call myself, especially the hurt and hurting parts of myself, sweet pet names, like boo bear, honey and baby girl.</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Words of affirmation and other coping statements like that might not be your thing, but there are other free resources out there that can help get you started on things like deep breathing or guided meditation. I\u2019ll leave some recommendations in the episode notes so you can consider some to put in your coping kit.</p><br/><p>I tend to think of our second to last category, as the people category. It doesn&#39;t have to mean people that you reach out to for help necessarily. It can mean people who always make you laugh and feel better, or places where you&#39;re around people and it&#39;s distracting, or someone you can count on to do some of the activities we just brainstormed with you, so you don&#39;t have to do them alone. But if possible, it can be really helpful to also include people who you do reach out to and turn to for actual support if you need it.</p><br/><p>Kevin: Talking with somebody who can kind of help you work through everything. Be like, hey, I&#39;m going through some things. And then without even prompting, they say, hey, do you want to talk about it? Or is there anything I can do? It&#39;s not even a distraction, but it is, it&#39;s good to just sort out with somebody who cares and who understands and can empathize. Self-care is tough, but I, we&#39;re all out here trying.</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: And lastly, one of the best parts of any coping kit in my experience are the things that defy categorization, cause you straight up made \u2018em up. And I so encourage people to name that and just lean into it. Honestly, these next couple of submissions just really inspired me.</p><br/><p>Anne: When I&#39;m in my feelings about something. Not quite depressed, just like having an emotional reaction. I find that the best thing to do is to feel it. So I will lean in all the way, full main character. Will draw the blinds, turn off all the lights, light a bunch of candles and lay on the floor \u2026 and play like 1980s power ballads. And I&#39;ll just cry, and it feels really nice.</p><br/><p>Anonymous: My coping mechanism, which a lot of people actually judge, but has been to sort of like post funny Instagram stories or TikToks about it. It&#39;s sort of walking the line between complaining and just sort of like cathartic humor, and I&#39;m still trying to figure out exactly what it means to me, and if it feels healthy or maybe toxic. But I think in the end, laughing about things has proven to me to be the most cathartic way I can possibly cope with my mental health struggles. I will just keep posting and laughing about it and using that as my coping mechanism.</p><br/><p>Anonymous: Another technique is one I call flopping. Sometimes when I&#39;m spent and raw feeling, I just need to zone the F out and be non-responsive. Like I can partially watch something hella chill on the TV, stare out the window, doze in and out of a nap. It doesn&#39;t really matter what I do while I&#39;m flopping. The main element is that I have literally flopped onto the bed in a mostly horizontal position. And I don&#39;t have to get up anytime soon. Freedom to just be.</p><br/><p>Your coping kit can contain any number of these things. Some coping kits might be heavier on objects and things that engage your senses, and others might be all therapeutic tools all the time because that\u2019s what you need when you\u2019re feeling x,y,z. There\u2019s no perfect formula to it.</p><br/><p>And the cool thing about a coping kit is that it can change over time. And probably will. You\u2019ll be picking up new ideas and finding new things that make you feel better. Hopefully maybe on this show. So now I want to know: What\u2019s in your coping kit?

[Sound of sloshing water] Think of that underwater sensation in your head, how out of it you feel.\n\nNow picture what you do to take care of yourself when you have a cold. What makes you feel better? What foods and drinks do you gravitate toward? Warm soup. Ginger Ale. Toast. A mug of tea. And, what do you do? Maybe you go straight back to bed. Maybe take a shower and change into clean pajamas. Maybe you drag the coziest blankets to the couch and burrito up. What shows do you watch? Who do you text? What supplies do you gather? The whole ritual.\n\nNow I want you to think about a moment when you weren\u2019t feeling so hot mentally. Choose a type of moment that comes up occasionally, like a cold does. Something that\u2019s no fun, but something familiar. Maybe there are times when you\u2019re so frustrated by work you could scream. Maybe there are weekends that you don\u2019t have any plans and feel extra lonely. Maybe sometimes your to-do list reaches a certain point \u2026 that you can feel nothing but overwhelmed. Or maybe you don\u2019t have a specific moment or reason\u2014maybe sometimes your sadness or anxiety or hurt or pain just flares up, and you know you\u2019re in for a rough day.\n\nWhatever situation you choose, remember what it\u2019s like, how you felt.\n\nDid you know what to reach for? Did you know what would make you feel better? Did you know what you really needed in that moment?\n\nFor a long time, I didn\u2019t. A lot of the time. We know what to do when we\u2019re sick. Why do we know so much less about what to do when we\u2019re angry? Or sad? Or lonely? Or overwhelmed? Or anything?\n\nWhy don\u2019t we have a plan for that?\n\nTHEME MUSIC\n\nHey, I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings...even when you\u2019re not exactly sure what will make you feel better. Every episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope\u2014with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, or with the world around us.\n\nAnna Borges: This episode, we\u2019re kind of cheating\u2014we\u2019re not exploring just one new way to cope. We\u2019re exploring, like, a whole ass coping kit. Because it doesn\u2019t matter how many self-care tips you know. Like, when you feel something strongly or you\u2019re in that moment when you\u2019re upset or pissed off or in your feelings, it can be hard to access the tools that exist in your head, and remember what makes you feel better.\n\nThat\u2019s where this thing I like to call a coping kit comes in.\n\nSounds fancy maybe but, really building a coping kit just means making a plan, and having a set of go-to tools or activities at the ready so you don\u2019t have to worry about it when you\u2019re in a bad place. You just go, okay, that is what I do when I feel this way. A coping kit is about making it as easy as possible for Future You to take care of yourself in moments when it\u2019s not easy to remember how the fuck to take care of yourself.\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about how to make one. For help on this, I put out a call on social media because no two coping kits are the same. And I don\u2019t just mean what\u2019s in it. I also mean how it comes to life.\n\nAnonymous: \u201cMy coping mechanism, which a lot of people actually judge, but, has been to sort of like post funny Instagram stories.\u201d\n\nKevin: \u201cPretty much anything off of Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s Emotion album. I do a lot of finger-pointing.\u201d\n\nAnonymous: \u201cI tell my spouse I'm going to go flop, which is code for this state of sort of like, I don't care and don't expect any level of productivity or substantial response from me.\u201d\n\nAnonymous: \u201cI actually also do jigsaw puzzles online. I think they\u2019re a really good way for me to focus on one thing, without having to think about the rest.\u201d\n\nPooja: \u201cI\u2019ll do like two reps on the leg press just to get some blood flowing, and then I'll come back up.\u201d\n\nAnna Borges: As you just heard, there\u2019s no one way to make a coping kit. Our producer, Georgie, has a physical box of things that she reaches for. And yours can be whatever\u2014a beautiful spread in a bullet journal, a list on your phone\u2019s app. Just make sure it exists somewhere outside your head.\n\nSo, how do you get started?\n\nFirst things first, you have to know what your coping kit is for, since it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all kinda deal. I personally have several kinds of coping kits and I keep track of them in a spreadsheet. If we\u2019re sticking with the whole sick metaphor, what you need when you have a cold is different from what you need when you have the stomach flu. And what you need when you\u2019re pissed at your boss is probably different than what you need when you\u2019re spiraling about climate anxiety.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to get hyper-specific with the situation like that though. A lot of the time, it\u2019s enough to start with the feeling you want to make a plan for dealing with. A coping kit for anxious moments. For frustrated ones. For insecure ones. Whatever feels like a good place to start. Whatever feeling or situation you build your kit for, the central question is basically, \u201cWhat do I need when I feel that way?\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re like, ugh, I have no idea? Don\u2019t worry. I have a few categories that might help get your juices flowing, plus we have plenty more examples from my cast of coping kit volunteers. We\u2019ll get into it all after a short break.\n\nMIDROLL\n\nHey, welcome back to Mood Ring! This is Anna Borges. Before the break we were talking about identifying the feelings that we want to soothe with our coping kits. So, now let\u2019s get to actually building one.\n\nAnna Borges: Think again, before we get started, of that moment or situation or feeling that you want to make a game plan for that\u2019s really helpful to have at the back of your mind. Whatever theme you landed on. So like I mentioned, when I\u2019m brainstorming a new coping kit, I tend to think about it in terms of a couple of different categories.\n\nThe first big bucket that I tend to start with is, well, literal things. Physical objects, tangible items that you can touch or use or wear or see or feel. They might be things that engage my senses\u2014you know like a really soft blanket to curl up in, or \u2026 an aromatherapy neck pillow I can throw in the microwave and get all warm and toasty. And I also think of comfort objects, like photos that bring up happy memories or a sentimental stuffed animal.\n\nOne of my favorite object-related ideas that I got from my callout was pretty unexpected\u2014lightbulbs. It just goes to show that these kits are very personal and specific.\n\nAnonymous: I have a couple of things that I do to cope when I've had a bad day at work or when I'm just not feeling very good and I don't want to get out of bed or something like that. I really enjoy, I got the Phillips hue, like, the colored LED lights and I set up a scene based on a sunset photo I took at the beach years ago. And it was just my favorite spot and it is my favorite, like, blend of warm lighting. And, that has helped me so much because I can just transport my back there to those warm moments.\n\nAnna Borges: The next kind of umbrella category is activities. And that is a very wide umbrella, but consider that soothing activities, distracting activities, fun activities, relaxing activities, just any activity that has the power to change your mood for the better.\n\nMy coping kits tend to be pretty heavy on activities, you know across the board. I think I'm probably not alone in that because we got a lot of fun activities-related submissions. So I\u2019m just gonna go ahead and jump into there because I like them better than mine. [laughs]\n\nAnne: When I feel out of control, or depressed in a really restless way, the thing that will always make me feel better is cleaning. I will do my dishes, which is my least favorite thing to do, but I'll put on a really trashy podcast while I do them. Or I'll sweep, which I love because I find it very fulfilling to see all of the amount of like dust and dirt and grime coming together and being disposed of.\n\nAnonymous: When I feel overwhelmed with everything that's going on in my life and trying to plan for the future, I take a walk over the Manhattan bridge. From my apartment to the bridge is a 30 minute walk. And over the bridge is another 30 minutes. I get 60 minutes to myself to clear my head, to think about my current state, and to think about my future state. I do not listen to a podcast, I do not listen to an audio book. I typically listen to instrumental music, or actually some booty shaking hit,s just to get the creative juices flowing. And I immediately feel better having that time to truly clear my head, be in nature, and get moving.\n\nAnonymous: I experience intrusive thoughts that suggest I do very bad things to myself. So, in the bad thoughts space, I pull out a few of my favorite responses to the yuck! Taking a super hot shower. I invested a couple of years ago in a teakwood shower bench so I can sit down, but not on the floor, which feels, like, too sad for me. This way, I'm able to relax more muscles and just kind of be in the steam, like, highly recommend this one.\n\nAnna Borges: We also got a lot of submissions around activities like exercise or arts and crafts and hobbies. Playing with pets was a big one, too. Really just anything that keeps you occupied.\n\nThe next thing might be more of a subcategory within activities, rather than its own category, but I like to call it out separately. And I'm thinking of activities like therapeutic exercises. You know, specific meditations, workbooks, that kind of thing.\n\nSome therapeutic activities might have a higher barrier to entry than others though, especially if you don\u2019t have access to a therapist or if you feel intimidated by some of the stuff you find online. But one did come up a few times in our submissions: positive self-talk and coping statements. Or, you know, talking to yourself.\n\nBonnie: I struggle with OCD, and one of my coping mechanisms lately is an affirmation where I basically just tell myself \u2026 this too shall pass. And that I look back at other times where I've been, in this situation before and I've overcome it. And looking back at those times reminds me that I can overcome the struggles now, like I did then.\n\nAnonymous: First, I kind of just say to myself, like, it's okay. It's okay. Because as basic and simple as that sounds like it is okay. It's not a life or death situation. I can figure out a way to solve it.\n\nAnonymous: I speak kindly to myself. I catch the mean words in my head and I hold them softly. I call myself, especially the hurt and hurting parts of myself, sweet pet names, like boo bear, honey and baby girl.\n\nAnna Borges: Words of affirmation and other coping statements like that might not be your thing, but there are other free resources out there that can help get you started on things like deep breathing or guided meditation. I\u2019ll leave some recommendations in the episode notes so you can consider some to put in your coping kit.\n\nI tend to think of our second to last category, as the people category. It doesn't have to mean people that you reach out to for help necessarily. It can mean people who always make you laugh and feel better, or places where you're around people and it's distracting, or someone you can count on to do some of the activities we just brainstormed with you, so you don't have to do them alone. But if possible, it can be really helpful to also include people who you do reach out to and turn to for actual support if you need it.\n\nKevin: Talking with somebody who can kind of help you work through everything. Be like, hey, I'm going through some things. And then without even prompting, they say, hey, do you want to talk about it? Or is there anything I can do? It's not even a distraction, but it is, it's good to just sort out with somebody who cares and who understands and can empathize. Self-care is tough, but I, we're all out here trying.\n\nAnna Borges: And lastly, one of the best parts of any coping kit in my experience are the things that defy categorization, cause you straight up made \u2018em up. And I so encourage people to name that and just lean into it. Honestly, these next couple of submissions just really inspired me.\n\nAnne: When I'm in my feelings about something. Not quite depressed, just like having an emotional reaction. I find that the best thing to do is to feel it. So I will lean in all the way, full main character. Will draw the blinds, turn off all the lights, light a bunch of candles and lay on the floor \u2026 and play like 1980s power ballads. And I'll just cry, and it feels really nice.\n\nAnonymous: My coping mechanism, which a lot of people actually judge, but has been to sort of like post funny Instagram stories or TikToks about it. It's sort of walking the line between complaining and just sort of like cathartic humor, and I'm still trying to figure out exactly what it means to me, and if it feels healthy or maybe toxic. But I think in the end, laughing about things has proven to me to be the most cathartic way I can possibly cope with my mental health struggles. I will just keep posting and laughing about it and using that as my coping mechanism.\n\nAnonymous: Another technique is one I call flopping. Sometimes when I'm spent and raw feeling, I just need to zone the F out and be non-responsive. Like I can partially watch something hella chill on the TV, stare out the window, doze in and out of a nap. It doesn't really matter what I do while I'm flopping. The main element is that I have literally flopped onto the bed in a mostly horizontal position. And I don't have to get up anytime soon. Freedom to just be.\n\nYour coping kit can contain any number of these things. Some coping kits might be heavier on objects and things that engage your senses, and others might be all therapeutic tools all the time because that\u2019s what you need when you\u2019re feeling x,y,z. There\u2019s no perfect formula to it.\n\nAnd the cool thing about a coping kit is that it can change over time. And probably will. You\u2019ll be picking up new ideas and finding new things that make you feel better. Hopefully maybe on this show. So now I want to know: What\u2019s in your coping kit?

Coined by Gretchen Rubin, the concept dictates that if it takes less than one minute to complete a task \u2014 think washing a dish \u2014 then you should just get it done right away. Anna interviews behavioral psychologist Dr. Ayelet Fishbach, exploring why following this rule can prove so challenging for some, and ways to reconsider your real\u00a0priorities.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p><strong>Full Transcript</strong></p><br/><p></p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Every Friday, I count on the minutes until the workday is over and the weekend begins. And every Friday there is always one thing standing between me and a night of relaxation, a list of chores, as long as a CVS receipt. I always tell myself that I&#39;ll do it differently. Next time I tell myself, next week I will wash my dish. As soon as I&#39;m done with it next week, I won&#39;t let these mugs accumulate on my nightstand and have to do the walk of shame to the kitchen with them. Like next week, I&#39;ll scoop the litter box every day. I will not let these chores pile up and ruin my relaxing Friday night, except I do. I always do. Come Monday, I&#39;ll finish dinner and bring my dish to sink. And instead of taking literally a minute to wash it while I&#39;m there, I just set it down and walk away. And then the next day I set another dish on top of it. And then the next thing you know, it&#39;s Friday again, and I&#39;m telling myself next week will be different. I just want to understand why is this so freaking hard?</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>I&#39;m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings, even when you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed by the smallest of tasks. Every episode we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, with our dishes or with the world around us.</p><br/><p>In this episode, we&#39;re talking about something that I hoped once upon a time would solve my chore problem. The one minute rule, it was coined by Gretchen Rubin, an author who among other things specialized in topics related to productivity and happiness. The one minute rule is straightforward: if a task or a chore will take less than a minute to accomplish just do it, don&#39;t think about it. Don&#39;t add unnecessary steps, like adding it to a to-do list, just do it then and there done. Boom. It seems simple enough, right? Except it didn&#39;t turn out to be that easy for me. I tried to live by the one minute rule, probably a million different times, and it&#39;s just never stuck or made much of a difference. So why do an episode on the one minute rule? Well, because this rule is known for its simplicity and its effectiveness, and I want to see if there is a way to make it work for me once and for all. So we decided to hit up a psychologist, specifically a motivation expert. Uh, Ayelet Fishbach PhD who wrote the book, <em>Get It Done</em>, surprising lessons from the science of motivation. And I didn&#39;t waste any time asking what I really wanted to know. Why do I struggle with this so much?</p><br/><p>Ayelet: Well we all discount the future? And that, uh, sounds like a fancy terror, but what it actually means is that anything that is in the future worse less than if it happened right now, uh, meaning if, uh, you consider doing work in the future, that seems like less work than if you need to do, uh, the work now, uh, if you need to pay a price in the future, that seems like it&#39;s less costly than if you paid now and also for good things. Okay. If you think about doing something exciting next month, well, it&#39;s not as exciting as doing it today. So as, as people we discount the future, which means that we, we like to postpone.</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah, that is, that is very at least true for me. I think just the instant gratification of it all feels very human at least, but is hard to push against, you know, like, because I think, for example, like when it comes to like goals and stuff, I&#39;m pretty good at breaking things down into smaller tasks and really building toward it. But with, for example, my dish example that is, feels like a lot of effort right now because I&#39;d rather be doing something else, but it feels very low reward. So I&#39;m kind of like, how, how do I change my perception?</p><br/><p>Ayelet: What do you do?</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah, no, like literally what do I do? Like, how do I, how do I change it? So I am motivated like motivated to do things in the present instead of just being like, screw you future Anna.</p><br/><p>Ayelet: So let, let me introduce another, uh, concept for, uh, research and motivation, which is, uh, a broad decision, uh, frame. Uh, what that means is that you make decision not just for now, but for every similar situation. Uh, in other words, you set a rule. And so it&#39;s not about whether I will wash my plate now is whether for the next month, every time I finish my dinner, I&#39;m going to wash my plate. And when you accumulate these decisions together is often easier to see your priorities. It&#39;s often easier to see the self control, uh, conflict.</p><br/><p>Anna: So is the specificity at play there what&#39;s important. Like, for example, if I was going to say, yeah, every time I eat dinner, I&#39;m gonna do my dish right after. Is that more motivating potentially than like the overarching 60 second rule or one minute rule that might be too broad?</p><br/><p>Ayelet: Yes, it is. Uh, more specific. It sets a rule about what to do when you have a plate in your hand, when you finish eating. Uh, I, it&#39;s a very example, but every time I, I finish eating, I will wash my plate rule, uh, means that you don&#39;t really need to think about it. And whether it&#39;s under a minute or over one minute, and whether this will even applies or just like, uh, the ideal is to make all these behaviors like washing your teeth. You don&#39;t really debate with yourself or least, most people don&#39;t have this like internal argument do I wash my teeth or do I not wash my teeth? It&#39;s morning. I woke up, I wash my teeth.</p><br/><p>Anna: Not if you have depression, first thing to go is my personal hygiene. No one, judge me if you&#39;re listening to this, but no, no, I, I definitely, I definitely really love it. Kind of speaks to what I was hoping would happen for me with the one minute rule, which is that these things would become automatic. That if I approached it with intentionality, then eventually it would, I don&#39;t know, become like brushing my teeth when I&#39;m in a good mental health place, you know? But what, what&#39;s the difference between something that becomes kind of a habit that you don&#39;t have to think about and the things that feel like they take so much work?</p><br/><p>Ayelet: The one thing to realize is that there is a range. Like it&#39;s not either it&#39;s a habit or not. Okay. So washing your teeth is kind of the extreme example, but how about exercising three times a week, even when people tell you that they have the habit, it&#39;s very easy to quit that habit.</p><br/><p>Anna: I am curious then since the goal doesn&#39;t always have to be to make it a habit, even though I personally would love to make these boring things, a habit. Is there a way to make doing them when they&#39;re not a habit, feel more fulfilling or be present in these moments or affirming to myself or the life that I want to live,</p><br/><p>Ayelet: Make it fun.</p><br/><p>Anna: I can&#39;t make doing my dishes fun. How,</p><br/><p>Ayelet: You know, the music, uh, find a way to, uh, uh, just make it, uh, more pleasant, uh, but seriously, like what&#39;s what predicts what we do most of the time. It just, it feels good at the moment. It&#39;s not so much, it&#39;s important for us in the long run. It&#39;s like people with clean houses have found a way to enjoy cleaning.</p><br/><p>Anna: I&#39;m gonna have to try that tonight. It&#39;s as we&#39;re recording, it&#39;s a Friday and Friday is my deal with all the crap that&#39;s accumulated night, truly. It&#39;s like all the dishes that I&#39;m talking about not having done, but tieing to like, no, I know this is a podcast about mental health. Like I have my own mental health struggles and I&#39;m sure a lot of people listening do too. And I&#39;m curious whether or not in your experience, something like the 60 second rule can help with motivation or decision making, you know, when things are like things mentally are stacked against you is almost how I put that, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s how I want to put it, but you, you know, when you&#39;re depressed as hell!</p><br/><p>Ayelet: When it gets to vision. I, I, I think that really is that the most important thing in your life to have clean plates and, and to finish this, to do list, is, is this the reason to, to do things? Uh, uh, because it sounds to me like a, you know, sometimes we just, we want to deal with all these errands. Uh, so our desk is clear and, and we feel that our mind is clear and we can do something else, but really the, the doing something else is the goal. Right? So like,</p><br/><p>Anna: Well, actually, I, I am really curious about how this ties into your work about like creating an environment that&#39;s sets you up for, I don&#39;t know the life that you want to live, but you know, how your environment might, might impact things. And so for me, like dishes is a really great example of that. Like, I may not care about my dishes that much, but I&#39;m like, oh, I also know that like my environment being clean does set me up, I think for like, decisions that I wanna make and stuff like that.</p><br/><p>Ayelet: Yes. And so the way to change behavior is by changing the situation in which the behavior occurs. Okay. And like, that sounds fancy. It&#39;s not such a fancy principle. Okay. Like if, you know, if, if you want to wake up in the morning, you set an alarm clock, uh, because if you are in a quiet dark room, then it&#39;s easy to stay in bed. Uh, uh, we all do it intuitively. Other changes to the situation are less intuitive, uh, changes that involve, uh, removing certain objects from your environment, because they&#39;re unhealthy for you or removing certain people from your environment, because they&#39;re unhealthy for you and, and bringing other people to your environment. Uh, these are changes that, that require some, uh, more, uh, sophistication and then a whole new level of sophistication is even in a given environment, change the way that you think about it. So, you know, in, in like one thing that we explored a lot is whether you focus on what you have done or what you have not done. And I, I feel like I will stick to the plate because it&#39;s a really nice way to position everything in motivation science, the dirty plates, they&#39;re also clean plates in your house, hopefully. Okay. Maybe one, you know, uh, and, and so you can focus on, uh, the, the many things that you could clean, or the few things that you already cleared from your desk or, or cleaned in your, uh, sink.. And when we are unsure that we can do something that we are committed often, the, the way to move forward is actually look back. It&#39;s not about the work that we need to do. It&#39;s about that. Like, let let&#39;s see the work that I&#39;ve already done.</p><br/><p>Anna: Mm-hmm but does it have to, can it like, could your goals align with like your aspirational self, you know, because like half the time I&#39;m kind of like, you know what, you&#39;re right. I don&#39;t get care about the dishes. I don&#39;t care about being prompt when responding to all my emails, emails are fake, but half of me is like, you know what, maybe I do wanna be the person who cares about this kind of thing. Like, how do you balance that? ,</p><br/><p>Ayelet: Uh, well, you can certainly aspire to, uh, to be a different person in a way we always aspire to be a different person. I, we always have our ideal self, which is different than our present self, because that person is, uh, is the person that we are going to be in the future. But we need to make sure that this person is, uh, is really like the, the person that we want to be. And, and if that sounds confusing, like we need to see that we don&#39;t have something internal conflict where we are not really sure, like, you know, you keep bringing tidiness, like maybe you are not really the tidy person in your mind.</p><br/><p>Anna: All right. We&#39;ll hear more from Dr. Fishbach back in a sec. And I guess I&#39;m gonna go check out my clean plate to dirty plate ratio. We&#39;ll see you after the break.</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>Anna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. So, I can confirm that I have at least one plate for dinner tonight. So on that note, let&#39;s dive back in to my interview with Dr. Fishbach.</p><br/><p>Anna: What&#39;s so interesting to me is I, I think I&#39;m having a hard time wrapping my head around, like, as like the line between motivation, usually like motivation to me speaks to like wanting something for ourselves, wanting to be something different, wanting to move towards, like, how do we balance motivation with acceptance, like accepting ourselves and the ideal version of ourselves and work toward the ideal version of ourselves. How, how do those coexist?</p><br/><p>Ayelet: I, I love this question because \u2026 it illustrates such a, you know, a big misunderstanding in \u2026 in the field in a way, uh, in order to move forward, you need to accept yourself, you need to, uh, to like yourself and believe in, in yourself. And yeah. Right. And so \u2026 like we know that when people say, I, I hate myself, therefore I will change. Well, that doesn&#39;t work very well. Right.</p><br/><p>Anna: You mean hatred, spite aren&#39;t good motivators? Because that&#39;s worked for me so far.</p><br/><p>Ayelet: I, yeah, I strongly believe that \u2026 we need to believe in our abilities and we need to know what we used to call self-efficacy, and I just hate this, this work, but, some general belief in our commitment. Commitment is a two ingredient, recipe. Commitment means that you care about something and that you think that you can do it. Okay. If you just care, but you don&#39;t think that you can do it, then you are not trying. Right. And then you say, that&#39;s not for me. Uh, if you think that you can do it, but you don&#39;t care, then you also don&#39;t do it. So you really need the, the two things. And so, you know, if, if you don&#39;t start from a point of believing in yourself, then it&#39;s really hard to commit to anything. One of the problem with the, I mean, most of the problem with negative feedback is that often what people learn when they have setback backs in their life is that they cannot. Okay. And, and why would you bother there? Okay. Like you cannot, right. you should only bother if you can.</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah. But, but out of curiosity, for, you know, anyone who&#39;s listening and for myself who might be in an early or tough stage in like either their like self-compassion journey or self acceptance journey, and they still want to harness something of this wonderful insight you&#39;re bringing, what, what is a good in, on like really motivating yourself when you do sometimes struggle with believing that you can do things or caring about things?</p><br/><p>Ayelet: A good thing is \u2026 maybe look back and \u2026 and look at what you&#39;ve accomplished and, and look at \u2026 what worked well, and, you know, that motivates students who only took their first class to study. Okay. So you, you really need very little progress very little accomplishment in order to, to look back and, and, and just like consider the baby step and realize that that was a baby step, okay. That was \u2026 something. So at the, for, for novices, for know, people who have a self-doubt, really that looking back is \u2026 is the way, I mean, looking back at what you have accomplished looking back at, at what it does work and realize that um, moving forward is, uh, is coming from a sense that, that you can, that you, believe in, in yourself.</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely. And now, and now I&#39;ve started thinking about whether or not full circle, the one minute rule are really just small opportunities to accomplish things and show ourselves that we can.</p><br/><p>Ayelet: Yes. Yes.</p><br/><p>Anna: All right. Like not gonna lie. I was really proud of that little revelation. And in the moment I was like, yeah, I cracked the code. This is the mindset that&#39;s gonna help me stick to the one minute rule. And then I promptly forgot and went on with my life. What&#39;s funny is that the next Friday, I thought about Dr. Fishbach and the connection she drew between like these small tasks and our larger goals and values. It was the part of the conversation that I was most resistant to because listen, I&#39;m a firm believer that sometimes it&#39;s not that deep, sometimes dishes are just dishes, and I was like, these are just dishes. So I was like, you know, that myself doesn&#39;t work for me. Take what you like, leave the rest. That&#39;s fine. Except I think maybe it did work.</p><br/><p>Anna: All right. It has been a week since my interview with Dr. Fishback. And that means it&#39;s Friday and true to form I have not changed my behavior at all. And I&#39;m standing in front of a sink full of dishes in my kitchen counter full of dishes and trash. And just like, I&#39;m not gonna lie, it&#39;s not pretty in here. And this is usually when I would kick off my Friday night in my weekend by doing all those dishes and promising to do better next week. And maybe thinking about implementing the one minute rule, that whole song and dance. But I think this time, just to say that I tried it, I&#39;m gonna, I&#39;m gonna ask what would Dr. Fishbach do? And I think, I mean, who knows what Dr. Fishbach would do, but based on our conversation, I think that means it&#39;s time for me to ask, Hey, do I actually care about these dishes?</p><br/><p>And like, okay, like I care about the dishes. Like generally I care about having a clean space. However, I&#39;m narrowing that question to do I care about the dishes tonight. And I think tonight, what I care about more is relaxing and unwinding. And I think I care about having enough counter space to be able to like cook myself a good ass meal. But I think I can achieve that by</p><br/><p>putting the dishes on the counter, into the sink and not actually washing them, because I don&#39;t think that I care about washing the dishes tonight. I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s what&#39;s important to me tonight.</p><br/><p>Anna: The week after that, I kept up with my dishes. Me, maybe not right after I finished every meal and maybe not with the one minute rule in mind, but before Friday, Maybe it was because I was having a good week or maybe it was because I had named what was important to me. Like Dr. Fishbach said, we discount the future in favor of the present all the time. We discount, how much work will take, or how fun it will be, or how our future selves will feel or what they&#39;ll want. And turns out we also discount what might be helpful to us in the future, based on what we know about ourselves today. Honestly, this was a good reminder for me about what I said when I nervously started this podcast; I&#39;m going to, really lean in to the learning and the trying, and that means learning through trying. So I hope you&#39;ll try things out with me just to see what helps. Maybe that&#39;s the one minute rule or trying to make chores fun, or unpacking why these things feel so hard, or maybe it&#39;s just very reluctantly trying something you swear is not going to work. Some stuff will work for you. Some of it won&#39;t and I hope you&#39;ll join me in trying anyway.</p><br/><p>CREDITS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: Thanks for listening to Mood Ring, a production of APM studios and pizza shark.

            "contentSnippet": "Episode three of Mood Ring, hosted by Anna Borges, explores the One Minute Rule. Coined by Gretchen Rubin, the concept dictates that if it takes less than one minute to complete a task \u2014 think washing a dish \u2014 then you should just get it done right away. Anna interviews behavioral psychologist Dr. Ayelet Fishbach, exploring why following this rule can prove so challenging for some, and ways to reconsider your real\u00a0priorities.\n\n\nFull Transcript\n\n\nAnna Borges: Every Friday, I count on the minutes until the workday is over and the weekend begins. And every Friday there is always one thing standing between me and a night of relaxation, a list of chores, as long as a CVS receipt. I always tell myself that I'll do it differently. Next time I tell myself, next week I will wash my dish. As soon as I'm done with it next week, I won't let these mugs accumulate on my nightstand and have to do the walk of shame to the kitchen with them. Like next week, I'll scoop the litter box every day. I will not let these chores pile up and ruin my relaxing Friday night, except I do. I always do. Come Monday, I'll finish dinner and bring my dish to sink. And instead of taking literally a minute to wash it while I'm there, I just set it down and walk away. And then the next day I set another dish on top of it. And then the next thing you know, it's Friday again, and I'm telling myself next week will be different. I just want to understand why is this so freaking hard?\n\nTHEME MUSIC\n\nI'm Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings, even when you're feeling overwhelmed by the smallest of tasks. Every episode we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, with our dishes or with the world around us.\n\nIn this episode, we're talking about something that I hoped once upon a time would solve my chore problem. The one minute rule, it was coined by Gretchen Rubin, an author who among other things specialized in topics related to productivity and happiness. The one minute rule is straightforward: if a task or a chore will take less than a minute to accomplish just do it, don't think about it. Don't add unnecessary steps, like adding it to a to-do list, just do it then and there done. Boom. It seems simple enough, right? Except it didn't turn out to be that easy for me. I tried to live by the one minute rule, probably a million different times, and it's just never stuck or made much of a difference. So why do an episode on the one minute rule? Well, because this rule is known for its simplicity and its effectiveness, and I want to see if there is a way to make it work for me once and for all. So we decided to hit up a psychologist, specifically a motivation expert. Uh, Ayelet Fishbach PhD who wrote the book, Get It Done, surprising lessons from the science of motivation. And I didn't waste any time asking what I really wanted to know. Why do I struggle with this so much?\n\nAyelet: Well we all discount the future? And that, uh, sounds like a fancy terror, but what it actually means is that anything that is in the future worse less than if it happened right now, uh, meaning if, uh, you consider doing work in the future, that seems like less work than if you need to do, uh, the work now, uh, if you need to pay a price in the future, that seems like it's less costly than if you paid now and also for good things. Okay. If you think about doing something exciting next month, well, it's not as exciting as doing it today. So as, as people we discount the future, which means that we, we like to postpone.\n\nAnna: Yeah, that is, that is very at least true for me. I think just the instant gratification of it all feels very human at least, but is hard to push against, you know, like, because I think, for example, like when it comes to like goals and stuff, I'm pretty good at breaking things down into smaller tasks and really building toward it. But with, for example, my dish example that is, feels like a lot of effort right now because I'd rather be doing something else, but it feels very low reward. So I'm kind of like, how, how do I change my perception?\n\nAyelet: What do you do?\n\nAnna: Yeah, no, like literally what do I do? Like, how do I, how do I change it? So I am motivated like motivated to do things in the present instead of just being like, screw you future Anna.\n\nAyelet: So let, let me introduce another, uh, concept for, uh, research and motivation, which is, uh, a broad decision, uh, frame. Uh, what that means is that you make decision not just for now, but for every similar situation. Uh, in other words, you set a rule. And so it's not about whether I will wash my plate now is whether for the next month, every time I finish my dinner, I'm going to wash my plate. And when you accumulate these decisions together is often easier to see your priorities. It's often easier to see the self control, uh, conflict.\n\nAnna: So is the specificity at play there what's important. Like, for example, if I was going to say, yeah, every time I eat dinner, I'm gonna do my dish right after. Is that more motivating potentially than like the overarching 60 second rule or one minute rule that might be too broad?\n\nAyelet: Yes, it is. Uh, more specific. It sets a rule about what to do when you have a plate in your hand, when you finish eating. Uh, I, it's a very example, but every time I, I finish eating, I will wash my plate rule, uh, means that you don't really need to think about it. And whether it's under a minute or over one minute, and whether this will even applies or just like, uh, the ideal is to make all these behaviors like washing your teeth. You don't really debate with yourself or least, most people don't have this like internal argument do I wash my teeth or do I not wash my teeth? It's morning. I woke up, I wash my teeth.\n\nAnna: Not if you have depression, first thing to go is my personal hygiene. No one, judge me if you're listening to this, but no, no, I, I definitely, I definitely really love it. Kind of speaks to what I was hoping would happen for me with the one minute rule, which is that these things would become automatic.

But what, what's the difference between something that becomes kind of a habit that you don't have to think about and the things that feel like they take so much work?\n\nAyelet: The one thing to realize is that there is a range.

Is there a way to make doing them when they're not a habit, feel more fulfilling or be present in these moments or affirming to myself or the life that I want to live,\n\nAyelet: Make it fun.\n\nAnna: I can't make doing my dishes fun. How,\n\nAyelet: You know, the music, uh, find a way to, uh, uh, just make it, uh, more pleasant, uh, but seriously, like what's what predicts what we do most of the time. It just, it feels good at the moment. It's not so much, it's important for us in the long run. It's like people with clean houses have found a way to enjoy cleaning.\n\nAnna: I'm gonna have to try that tonight. It's as we're recording, it's a Friday and Friday is my deal with all the crap that's accumulated night, truly. It's like all the dishes that I'm talking about not having done, but tieing to like, no, I know this is a podcast about mental health. Like I have my own mental health struggles and I'm sure a lot of people listening do too. And I'm curious whether or not in your experience, something like the 60 second rule can help with motivation or decision making, you know, when things are like things mentally are stacked against you is almost how I put that, but I'm not sure that's how I want to put it, but you, you know, when you're depressed as hell!\n\nAyelet: When it gets to vision. I, I, I think that really is that the most important thing in your life to have clean plates and, and to finish this, to do list, is, is this the reason to, to do things?

And when we are unsure that we can do something that we are committed often, the, the way to move forward is actually look back. It's not about the work that we need to do. It's about that. Like, let let's see the work that I've already done.\n\nAnna: Mm-hmm but does it have to, can it like, could your goals align with like your aspirational self, you know, because like half the time I'm kind of like, you know what, you're right. I don't get care about the dishes. I don't care about being prompt when responding to all my emails, emails are fake, but half of me is like, you know what, maybe I do wanna be the person who cares about this kind of thing. Like, how do you balance that? ,\n\nAyelet: Uh, well, you can certainly aspire to, uh, to be a different person in a way we always aspire to be a different person.

We'll hear more from Dr. Fishbach back in a sec. And I guess I'm gonna go check out my clean plate to dirty plate ratio. We'll see you after the break.\n\nMIDROLL\n\nAnna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. So, I can confirm that I have at least one plate for dinner tonight. So on that note, let's dive back in to my interview with Dr. Fishbach.\n\nAnna: What's so interesting to me is I, I think I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around, like, as like the line between motivation, usually like motivation to me speaks to like wanting something for ourselves, wanting to be something different, wanting to move towards, like, how do we balance motivation with acceptance, like accepting ourselves and the ideal version of ourselves and work toward the ideal version of ourselves. How, how do those coexist?\n\nAyelet: I, I love this question because \u2026 it illustrates such a, you know, a big misunderstanding in \u2026 in the field in a way, uh, in order to move forward, you need to accept yourself, you need to, uh, to like yourself and believe in, in yourself. And yeah. Right. And so \u2026 like we know that when people say, I, I hate myself, therefore I will change. Well, that doesn't work very well. Right.\n\nAnna: You mean hatred, spite aren't good motivators? Because that's worked for me so far.\n\nAyelet: I, yeah, I strongly believe that \u2026 we need to believe in our abilities and we need to know what we used to call self-efficacy, and I just hate this, this work, but, some general belief in our commitment. Commitment is a two ingredient, recipe. Commitment means that you care about something and that you think that you can do it. Okay. If you just care, but you don't think that you can do it, then you are not trying. Right. And then you say, that's not for me. Uh, if you think that you can do it, but you don't care, then you also don't do it. So you really need the, the two things. And so, you know, if, if you don't start from a point of believing in yourself, then it's really hard to commit to anything. One of the problem with the, I mean, most of the problem with negative feedback is that often what people learn when they have setback backs in their life is that they cannot. Okay. And, and why would you bother there? Okay. Like you cannot, right. you should only bother if you can.\n\nAnna: Yeah. But, but out of curiosity, for, you know, anyone who's listening and for myself who might be in an early or tough stage in like either their like self-compassion journey or self acceptance journey, and they still want to harness something of this wonderful insight you're bringing, what, what is a good in, on like really motivating yourself when you do sometimes struggle with believing that you can do things or caring about things?\n\nAyelet: A good thing is \u2026 maybe look back and \u2026 and look at what you've accomplished and, and look at \u2026 what worked well, and, you know, that motivates students who only took their first class to study. Okay. So you, you really need very little progress very little accomplishment in order to, to look back and, and, and just like consider the baby step and realize that that was a baby step, okay. That was \u2026 something. So at the, for, for novices, for know, people who have a self-doubt, really that looking back is \u2026 is the way, I mean, looking back at what you have accomplished looking back at, at what it does work and realize that um, moving forward is, uh, is coming from a sense that, that you can, that you, believe in, in yourself.\n\nAnna: Absolutely. And now, and now I've started thinking about whether or not full circle, the one minute rule are really just small opportunities to accomplish things and show ourselves that we can.\n\nAyelet: Yes. Yes.\n\nAnna: All right. Like not gonna lie. I was really proud of that little revelation. And in the moment I was like, yeah, I cracked the code. This is the mindset that's gonna help me stick to the one minute rule. And then I promptly forgot and went on with my life. What's funny is that the next Friday, I thought about Dr. Fishbach and the connection she drew between like these small tasks and our larger goals and values. It was the part of the conversation that I was most resistant to because listen, I'm a firm believer that sometimes it's not that deep, sometimes dishes are just dishes, and I was like, these are just dishes. So I was like, you know, that myself doesn't work for me. Take what you like, leave the rest. That's fine. Except I think maybe it did work.\n\nAnna: All right. It has been a week since my interview with Dr. Fishback. And that means it's Friday and true to form I have not changed my behavior at all. And I'm standing in front of a sink full of dishes in my kitchen counter full of dishes and trash. And just like, I'm not gonna lie, it's not pretty in here. And this is usually when I would kick off my Friday night in my weekend by doing all those dishes and promising to do better next week. And maybe thinking about implementing the one minute rule, that whole song and dance. But I think this time, just to say that I tried it, I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask what would Dr. Fishbach do? And I think, I mean, who knows what Dr. Fishbach would do, but based on our conversation, I think that means it's time for me to ask, Hey, do I actually care about these dishes?\n\nAnd like, okay, like I care about the dishes. Like generally I care about having a clean space. However, I'm narrowing that question to do I care about the dishes tonight. And I think tonight, what I care about more is relaxing and unwinding. And I think I care about having enough counter space to be able to like cook myself a good ass meal. But I think I can achieve that by\n\nputting the dishes on the counter, into the sink and not actually washing them, because I don't think that I care about washing the dishes tonight. I don't think that that's what's important to me tonight.\n\nAnna: The week after that, I kept up with my dishes. Me, maybe not right after I finished every meal and maybe not with the one minute rule in mind, but before Friday, Maybe it was because I was having a good week or maybe it was because I had named what was important to me. Like Dr. Fishbach said, we discount the future in favor of the present all the time. We discount, how much work will take, or how fun it will be, or how our future selves will feel or what they'll want. And turns out we also discount what might be helpful to us in the future, based on what we know about ourselves today. Honestly, this was a good reminder for me about what I said when I nervously started this podcast; I'm going to, really lean in to the learning and the trying, and that means learning through trying. So I hope you'll try things out with me just to see what helps. Maybe that's the one minute rule or trying to make chores fun, or unpacking why these things feel so hard, or maybe it's just very reluctantly trying something you swear is not going to work. Some stuff will work for you. Some of it won't and I hope you'll join me in trying anyway.\n\nCREDITS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnna: Thanks for listening to Mood Ring, a production of APM studios and pizza shark.

Are those behaviors unhealthy and reasons to feel guilty, or are they fine to help you deal with what\u2019s going on in your life?</p><br/><p>Anna is joined by licensed mental health counselor Jor-El Caraballo to unpack how we can tell if our coping mechanisms are helpful or harmful, and how to enjoy them without all that shame.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p><strong>Full Transcript</strong></p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: Alright, I\u2019m gonna\u2026I\u2019m gonna tell you something\u2026</p><br/><p>Every once in a while, I get this taste of what I imagine it must be like to be...well-adjusted? You know like, whole stretches of time where I\u2019m not ruminating or anxious or lonely or sad. I am just...chill.</p><br/><p>...And then, Netflix will ask me\u2026</p><br/><p>NETFLIX TUDUM</p><br/><p>\u00a0\u201cAre you still watching?\u201d</p><br/><p>And the illusion is shattered. And I\u2019m forced to see my sad reflection in my smudged laptop screen, and all the thoughts and feelings I\u2019m avoiding come bubbling back up.</p><br/><p>MUSIC</p><br/><p>If I were the person I wanted to be, this would be the moment I say, \u201cYou know what, Netflix? No, I\u2019m not still watching. I\u2019m going to go do all the things I told myself I was going to do today.\u201d</p><br/><p>But I\u2019m me. So I hit \u201cnext episode\u201d and sink back into numb, distracted bliss.</p><br/><p>Binge-watching TV is a shitty coping mechanism of mine. And if we\u2019re all being honest with ourselves and each other, you probably have one too.</p><br/><p>Maybe your thing is video games. That\u2019s\u2026also my thing.</p><br/><p>Maybe you\u2019re partial to falling down the TikTok rabbit hole, scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.</p><br/><p>Or maybe swiping endlessly on dating apps and window-shopping for validation. Or real shopping. Our producer Jordan loves to obsessively order home goods from Amazon.</p><br/><p>Most of us have those things that we do for our mental health in the moment even though we know they\u2019re probably not all that good for our mental health in the long run. And that\u2019s fine! It\u2019s totally human to want to distract ourselves, or soothe ourselves, or whatever it is your thing does for you.</p><br/><p>Except\u2026I don\u2019t know about you, but I probably spend as much time judging myself for my shitty coping mechanisms as I do actually enjoying them. Which kind of defeats the purpose. But that doesn\u2019t mean I have to stop, right?</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>Hey friends, what\u2019s up? I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring: A Practical Guide to Feelings. Even when you feel like a swamp person with terrible coping mechanisms. Every episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope \u2014 with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brain, or with the world around us.</p><br/><p>Anna: If you thought today\u2019s episode was going to be about kicking these shitty coping habits to the curb, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not that kind of show. No, this episode is about how we can stop thinking about them as \u201cshitty\u201d in the first place and how we can tell when they\u2019re helpful or harmful, and how we can enjoy them without all the guilt and shame.</p><br/><p>Here to help us unpack it is our guest Jor-El Caraballo. He\u2019s a licensed mental health counselor and the cofounder of a health and wellness practice called Viva Mental Health and Wellness.</p><br/><p>Anna: I know how I think about coping mechanisms and what they mean but as a mental health professional, what is your kind of official definition of coping mechanisms?</p><br/><p>Jor-El: Yeah, it&#39;s, it&#39;s funny, because coping mechanisms, coping skills, any of those kind of terms we use, are really about the things we do the tools we utilize to manage our feelings and our thoughts manage our mental health. So they could be very sophisticated things. I don&#39;t know, like electromagnetic cranial stimulation, or they could be other things like journaling. And it really, it really depends on what someone finds the most helpful. But there&#39;s s uch a wide range of tools that we have access to that help us manage.</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah, I tend to think about it in terms of things that we can do ourselves without professional intervention. Does that kind of vibe?</p><br/><p>Jor-El: Yeah, yeah, I like that.</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah. Cuz I kind of have, or, at least in my circles, coping like mechanisms, that word has a specific connotation that does lean negative versus like coping strategies. And so I&#39;m curious, like, Are there good and bad coping mechanisms? Like that&#39;s how I categorize them? How do you tend to think about that?</p><br/><p>Jor-El: That&#39;s a, that&#39;s a really good question because the way I have my default setting, so to speak, is that coping mechanisms have no value. Morally, they, it&#39;s really anything because anything that you do any strategy can be good or bad, depending on how or when it&#39;s applied. So just for like, a very, like, this is super like traditional psychoanalytic, right? So denial, for instance, is a defense mechanism or a coping mechanism that we all have the capacity for, right? Which basically says, we don&#39;t, we don&#39;t acknowledge what we&#39;re feeling in the moment, if, especially if it&#39;s like a painful feeling that comes up for us. So we&#39;re just like, No, I&#39;m good, fine. Everything&#39;s cool, right? And in some instances, that is actually a really helpful tool, where you might be limited in your use of other strategies or tools. But in other situations, or if you rely on that perpetually, as your one go to, then obviously, you&#39;re going to end up in a place where you&#39;re very disconnected with reality. Right? Because you&#39;re walking around saying, like, no, that&#39;s not happening. This is not happening. I&#39;m not here. I&#39;m over here,</p><br/><p>Anna: Oh, wow! Are you dragging me right now? Is this our therapy session?</p><br/><p>[Jor-El laughs]</p><br/><p>Anna: I mean, I basically invited you on to be like, please tell me what I do is okay, give me like a professional stamp of approval. But yeah, so it sounds to me what I&#39;m hearing is that there&#39;s also a line between maybe conscious coping mechanisms and like unconscious ones, because I don&#39;t know that I recognize in the moment when I&#39;m in denial, but I definitely recognize when I&#39;m binge watching 12 seasons of some show.</p><br/><p>Jor-El: Yeah, and I think something like denial because it is, you know, as Freud would argue that it is innate. And so it is much easier for that to kind of roll by in our subconsciousness. And so it&#39;s hard to kind of catch that that&#39;s happening in the moment. Usually, there are those little moments that happen afterwards, at least for me, I&#39;m like, \u201cOh\u2026I was lying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anna: I love that we\u2019re bringing Freud into this. Like very early. Like, welcome to the conversation, Freud.</p><br/><p>Jor-El: He\u2019s been on my mind lately, you know?</p><br/><p>Anna: Just always. So I&#39;m thinking a lot about the kind of like conscious coping mechanisms, you know, the ones that we perhaps feel a certain way about in the moment, you know, like I mentioned, mine, it&#39;s going to be my go to, I am very into the escapism, play a lot of video games, watch a lot of TV will do it for a very long period of time. And then, of course, as I&#39;m doing it, even though it&#39;s like what I want to do, I just feel like guilty and like crap, and like, judging myself and not enjoying it in the moment. Is that common? Like, do you see this in your work?</p><br/><p>Jor-El: Yeah, I think it&#39;s really common. I mean, especially if we&#39;re talking about living through a global pandemic. I think it&#39;s really common for people to be using some skills that are finding ways to cope, that they&#39;re like, Ah, this isn&#39;t the best. Like, I don&#39;t feel great doing it. And I think, I don&#39;t know, I think that everything needs to happen in moderation. And so I always talk to people about having, like, you, obviously going to have your go to is like, I don&#39;t know, binge watching. Whatever show, right. I&#39;ve been binge watching Frasier. You know, unsurprisingly, you know, more times than I can count. But, you know, it&#39;s like being able to have various things at your disposal, you should always have a toolbox, because sometimes it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s not good to do one thing to escape, maybe you need different things to escape, maybe you need a little space to lean into something, and then you can pop back out, you know, back into escapism.</p><br/><p>Anna: I don\u2019t pop out. That&#39;s my problem. Yeah, I live there.</p><br/><p>Anna: Hey. I\u2019m just glad to know that all those nights I spent staying up until 3am playing <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Fire Emblem 3 Houses</em> or whatever my flavor of the week was\u00a0 wasn\u2019t for nothing. In fact, I think I\u2019m going to go ahead and add playing video games to my coping mechanism toolbox. Officially. For real. After the break, we\u2019ll finish up our interview with Jor-El Caraballo and talk about some of the most common coping mechanisms that come up in his work.</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>Anna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. I\u2019m Anna Borges. Before the break we were talking about our shitty coping mechanisms, and by that I mean our awesome coping mechanisms that we\u2019re working toward embracing,\u00a0 with licensed therapist Jor-El Caraballo. Let\u2019s get back to it.</p><br/><p>Anna: I would actually love to pause like, because we&#39;re binge watchers, it sounds like but for people who might not be this might not be like their go to I&#39;m curious if you have any examples of other shame inducing, like, quote, unquote, shitty coping mechanisms that like you hear from from people you work with?</p><br/><p>Jor-El: Eating, it&#39;s right up there. Specifically like comfort food. And it&#39;s just so interesting, because, again, like, I come from this mindset that even something like that, like comfort food has definitely gotten this bad rap. Because like, Oh, it&#39;s just all the bad things you want to eat. First of all, there are no bad things. Second of all, they they&#39;re comforting for a reason, right? Either they provide some chemical reaction that we interpret our bodies interpret as really comforting, or\u2026 and or. We also have attached memories, right? That really put us in a comfortable, safe space emotionally when we revisit with those things. So it&#39;s okay. But again, it&#39;s like that can&#39;t be your only thing. Because then if you&#39;re only relying on you know, comfort food to cope, then you might end up creating some other problems that you have to deal with later, that that are unintentional. It&#39;s about finding that balance.</p><br/><p>Anna: Absolutely. I could talk about complicated relationships to food all day. But what struck me about what you said is that there is a reason that this these things generally make us feel good. So I&#39;m curious, like, even if it&#39;s no, we know that we&#39;re doing it for a reason. It&#39;s like maybe what we need or really want in the moment. Why do we feel guilty about it? Rather than saying like, okay, yeah, this is this is what I need today. I need to binge watch, or I don&#39;t know if need is the right word. But this is what sure this is what would feel good to me right now. And I need to feel good.</p><br/><p>Jor-El: Yeah, I just think that there&#39;s so much noise about \u2026one about mental health in general, and about how we respond to it. And so I find that a lot of times I&#39;m having conversations with clients about unpacking the internalized messages that come with, like your chosen coping strategies or coping mechanisms and saying like, Okay, well, you know, maybe there&#39;s a part of this that you&#39;re relying on or the extent to which you&#39;re relying on it, which is unhealthy. But the thing in and of itself isn&#39;t all that bad. I think it&#39;s about reminding yourself that each and everything has its place. Right? So avoidance has its place, escapism has its place. Denial has its place. But the thing that really keeps us from being healthy, or like, quote unquote, good, is when we&#39;re really relying on things to perpetually and continuously avoid things that we could change. Right? And because I think we all need to feel empowered, to some extent over our circumstances in our lives and our mental health. And so, you know, it&#39;s, it&#39;s really, it&#39;s not good to always rely on certain things when there are other things, other progressive things I&#39;ll say that you could be using to change what your experience is.</p><br/><p>Anna: Yeah, no, totally. Oh, I can&#39;t wait to dive into that. But first, I&#39;d love to take a step back. Because you said something very interesting about like, unpacking internalized message messages about that kind of thing. Can you expand on that?</p><br/><p>Jor-El: Yeah, I think this is really about the, whether it&#39;s messages that we get from friends, family, the greater social culture, about the things that we&#39;re supposed to be doing, or the things that are healthy to do.But it really does, can create this relationship between coping and mental health. It says\u00a0 like, if you just do X, you will feel better. And some that&#39;s not really what coping is. It&#39;s, it isn&#39;t meant to bring you some relief. Right. But that relief is momentary.</p><br/><p>Anna: At least for me, I know that my inner voice sounds like a lot of what you were just spelling out coming from other people and other messages, and I shouldn&#39;t be doing this, I should be doing that. And it sounds to me that like this is very similar and that like when we&#39;re doing our quote unquote shitty coping mechanisms, we are bogged down by guilt that we should be doing like more adaptive coping mechanisms. We should be going for a walk, we should be doing all the things that we know will make us feel better. And it&#39;s just such a fine line.</p><br/><p>Jor-El: Yeah, it&#39;s a super fine line. And I, to me, this is also just interconnected to the conversation on rest. And it&#39;s like it&#39;s this idea is Well, if coping is supposed to bring about some relief, if you&#39;re also feeling crappy while you&#39;re doing it, it&#39;s probably not the best strategy. Right? And so if you&#39;re similarly if you&#39;re trying to rest as a way to cope, and the whole time you&#39;re trying to counter this guilt that you have about resting, right, you&#39;re not really resting.</p><br/><p>Anna: And so many of these things are also rest. You know what I mean? I don&#39;t want to like speak for every shitty coping mechanism. But a lot of them are just us resting. There are things that don&#39;t serve a larger purpose.</p><br/><p>Jor-El: It&#39;s about sort of turning down the noise on your nervous system. Right?</p><br/><p>Anna: Can you expand on that? I can&#39;t do that for my nervous system. My nervous system has a mind of its own, it has a volume knob I cannot access or maybe I can. Teach me how.</p><br/><p>Jor-El: Yeah, my mind stays busy too. So I understand. It&#39;s, it&#39;s like, so when we&#39;re when we&#39;re feeling things, when we are stressed, we&#39;re experiencing anxiety, or what have you. It&#39;s also a, it&#39;s, it&#39;s a physical process to right, your body is responding, your brain is responding. And when that happens, your nervous system is just more activated. Right, which also produces inflammation in the body, excess cortisol production, like all these things, it&#39;s super dynamic, all these things are happening. And so really what coping is meant to do, at least in my opinion, is to like kind of like if you had a dimmer, right, you can move that dimmer down and say, like, okay, if I&#39;m like an eight right now, like, this is not good. Can I get to a six and what will help me get to a six, right, or what will help me get to a four, maybe I can journal or maybe I&#39;ll take a nap. Or maybe I&#39;ll call a friend for some support. And that&#39;ll bring that all that, you know, nervous system arousal down, which will help you feel better, and we&#39;ll also help you be more functional.</p><br/><p>Anna: We, you know, judge ourselves for not being productive or being sedentary. And I wanted to talk about kind of like the inherent like, ableism in this framing, when we think about these things\u2026</p><br/><p>Jor-El: Yeah, well, and I, I&#39;ve done my best to not step on a huge soapbox on social about this. So I&#39;ll throw out little pieces here and there. Yeah, it&#39;s so much of so much of the conversation around coping and stuff is has this looped in? Well, a few things ableism and capitalism, right? That those are big parts of those, like little message that messages that we internalize, about like, Oh, you&#39;re supposed you always supposed to be productive? Why? Why? Why must you always be doing something? Right? Also, you are human, you have limitations physically, psychologically? Why are we pretending that we don&#39;t? Oh,\u00a0 ableism? Right, because everyone should be achieving a certain level at all times. And everyone has the same capacity. And that&#39;s just a lie. And sometimes that is also like the beginning process of that unpacking is we&#39;re like, let&#39;s tell the truth. The truth is everyone&#39;s not the same. The truth is people need different things. The truth is humans need rest. They need coping, they need relief. Everyone does.</p><br/><p>Anna: Internalizing those messages takes time. Some days, it still might feel more like, \u201cEveryone needs rest\u2014except me! Everyone needs coping\u2014except me! Everyone needs relief\u2014except me! I need discipline and punishment and guilt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Been there. I push back against that voice by scheduling my shitty coping mechanisms. Not as a way to control myself or cut back\u2014no, I mean, if I think I\u2019m going to need to spend all weekend playing video games and cuddling with my cats, that\u2019s exactly what I put on my calendar. And then my calendar gives me permission. When shame creeps up in the moment, I can remind myself that this is exactly what I planned. This is exactly what I needed.</p><br/><p>You might find scheduling helpful too, or you might need to give yourself permission a different way. Maybe you give yourself permission out loud or write it in a journal or set a text alert or ask a friend to hold you accountable.</p><br/><p>The exact way you give yourself permission isn\u2019t the important part. As Jor-El really drove home, being intentional is the real tool.</p><br/><p>Jor-El: I think that one of the most powerful tools that we can arm ourselves with it, especially when it comes to coping, is making the choice. There&#39;s something really powerful about saying, I&#39;m struggling right now. And I&#39;m choosing to cope in this way. Because I think it offers you one: just the affirmation of your feeling and what you&#39;re going through. But it also gives you an opportunity to briefly check in with yourself and say, Oh, is this thing going to give me the thing I&#39;m looking for right now?</p><br/><p>Anna: It won\u2019t always be easy to make that choice, or to check in with yourself at all. Luckily, the thing about all this living with intention is that you have to <em>intentionally</em> give yourself permission to fuck up this living intentionally thing. It\u2019s called being human. And maybe that\u2019s what this whole permission thing is really all about\u2014giving ourselves permission to be human.</p><br/><p>Just like I\u2019m giving myself permission to say cheesy shit like that, oh god.

            "contentSnippet": "Mood Ring host Anna Borges talks about coping mechanisms like binge-watching television and late-night gaming. Are those behaviors unhealthy and reasons to feel guilty, or are they fine to help you deal with what\u2019s going on in your life?\n\nAnna is joined by licensed mental health counselor Jor-El Caraballo to unpack how we can tell if our coping mechanisms are helpful or harmful, and how to enjoy them without all that shame.\n\n\nFull Transcript\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: Alright, I\u2019m gonna\u2026I\u2019m gonna tell you something\u2026\n\nEvery once in a while, I get this taste of what I imagine it must be like to be...well-adjusted? You know like, whole stretches of time where I\u2019m not ruminating or anxious or lonely or sad. I am just...chill.\n\n...And then, Netflix will ask me\u2026\n\nNETFLIX TUDUM\n\n\u00a0\u201cAre you still watching?\u201d\n\nAnd the illusion is shattered. And I\u2019m forced to see my sad reflection in my smudged laptop screen, and all the thoughts and feelings I\u2019m avoiding come bubbling back up.\n\nMUSIC\n\nIf I were the person I wanted to be, this would be the moment I say, \u201cYou know what, Netflix? No, I\u2019m not still watching. I\u2019m going to go do all the things I told myself I was going to do today.\u201d\n\nBut I\u2019m me. So I hit \u201cnext episode\u201d and sink back into numb, distracted bliss.\n\nBinge-watching TV is a shitty coping mechanism of mine. And if we\u2019re all being honest with ourselves and each other, you probably have one too.\n\nMaybe your thing is video games. That\u2019s\u2026also my thing.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re partial to falling down the TikTok rabbit hole, scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.\n\nOr maybe swiping endlessly on dating apps and window-shopping for validation. Or real shopping. Our producer Jordan loves to obsessively order home goods from Amazon.\n\nMost of us have those things that we do for our mental health in the moment even though we know they\u2019re probably not all that good for our mental health in the long run. And that\u2019s fine! It\u2019s totally human to want to distract ourselves, or soothe ourselves, or whatever it is your thing does for you.\n\nExcept\u2026I don\u2019t know about you, but I probably spend as much time judging myself for my shitty coping mechanisms as I do actually enjoying them. Which kind of defeats the purpose. But that doesn\u2019t mean I have to stop, right?\n\nTHEME MUSIC\n\nHey friends, what\u2019s up? I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring: A Practical Guide to Feelings. Even when you feel like a swamp person with terrible coping mechanisms. Every episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope \u2014 with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brain, or with the world around us.\n\nAnna: If you thought today\u2019s episode was going to be about kicking these shitty coping habits to the curb, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not that kind of show. No, this episode is about how we can stop thinking about them as \u201cshitty\u201d in the first place and how we can tell when they\u2019re helpful or harmful, and how we can enjoy them without all the guilt and shame.\n\nHere to help us unpack it is our guest Jor-El Caraballo. He\u2019s a licensed mental health counselor and the cofounder of a health and wellness practice called Viva Mental Health and Wellness.\n\nAnna: I know how I think about coping mechanisms and what they mean but as a mental health professional, what is your kind of official definition of coping mechanisms?\n\nJor-El: Yeah, it's, it's funny, because coping mechanisms, coping skills, any of those kind of terms we use, are really about the things we do the tools we utilize to manage our feelings and our thoughts manage our mental health. So they could be very sophisticated things. I don't know, like electromagnetic cranial stimulation, or they could be other things like journaling. And it really, it really depends on what someone finds the most helpful. But there's s uch a wide range of tools that we have access to that help us manage.\n\nAnna: Yeah, I tend to think about it in terms of things that we can do ourselves without professional intervention. Does that kind of vibe?\n\nJor-El: Yeah, yeah, I like that.\n\nAnna: Yeah. Cuz I kind of have, or, at least in my circles, coping like mechanisms, that word has a specific connotation that does lean negative versus like coping strategies. And so I'm curious, like, Are there good and bad coping mechanisms? Like that's how I categorize them? How do you tend to think about that?\n\nJor-El: That's a, that's a really good question because the way I have my default setting, so to speak, is that coping mechanisms have no value. Morally, they, it's really anything because anything that you do any strategy can be good or bad, depending on how or when it's applied. So just for like, a very, like, this is super like traditional psychoanalytic, right? So denial, for instance, is a defense mechanism or a coping mechanism that we all have the capacity for, right? Which basically says, we don't, we don't acknowledge what we're feeling in the moment, if, especially if it's like a painful feeling that comes up for us. So we're just like, No, I'm good, fine. Everything's cool, right? And in some instances, that is actually a really helpful tool, where you might be limited in your use of other strategies or tools. But in other situations, or if you rely on that perpetually, as your one go to, then obviously, you're going to end up in a place where you're very disconnected with reality. Right? Because you're walking around saying, like, no, that's not happening. This is not happening. I'm not here. I'm over here,\n\nAnna: Oh, wow! Are you dragging me right now? Is this our therapy session?\n\n[Jor-El laughs]\n\nAnna: I mean, I basically invited you on to be like, please tell me what I do is okay, give me like a professional stamp of approval. But yeah, so it sounds to me what I'm hearing is that there's also a line between maybe conscious coping mechanisms and like unconscious ones, because I don't know that I recognize in the moment when I'm in denial, but I definitely recognize when I'm binge watching 12 seasons of some show.\n\nJor-El: Yeah, and I think something like denial because it is, you know, as Freud would argue that it is innate. And so it is much easier for that to kind of roll by in our subconsciousness. And so it's hard to kind of catch that that's happening in the moment. Usually, there are those little moments that happen afterwards, at least for me, I'm like, \u201cOh\u2026I was lying.\u201d\n\nAnna: I love that we\u2019re bringing Freud into this. Like very early. Like, welcome to the conversation, Freud.\n\nJor-El: He\u2019s been on my mind lately, you know?\n\nAnna: Just always. So I'm thinking a lot about the kind of like conscious coping mechanisms, you know, the ones that we perhaps feel a certain way about in the moment, you know, like I mentioned, mine, it's going to be my go to, I am very into the escapism, play a lot of video games, watch a lot of TV will do it for a very long period of time. And then, of course, as I'm doing it, even though it's like what I want to do, I just feel like guilty and like crap, and like, judging myself and not enjoying it in the moment. Is that common? Like, do you see this in your work?\n\nJor-El: Yeah, I think it's really common. I mean, especially if we're talking about living through a global pandemic. I think it's really common for people to be using some skills that are finding ways to cope, that they're like, Ah, this isn't the best. Like, I don't feel great doing it. And I think, I don't know, I think that everything needs to happen in moderation. And so I always talk to people about having, like, you, obviously going to have your go to is like, I don't know, binge watching. Whatever show, right. I've been binge watching Frasier. You know, unsurprisingly, you know, more times than I can count. But, you know, it's like being able to have various things at your disposal, you should always have a toolbox, because sometimes it doesn't, it's not good to do one thing to escape, maybe you need different things to escape, maybe you need a little space to lean into something, and then you can pop back out, you know, back into escapism.\n\nAnna: I don\u2019t pop out. That's my problem. Yeah, I live there.\n\nAnna: Hey. I\u2019m just glad to know that all those nights I spent staying up until 3am playing Breath of the Wild or Fire Emblem 3 Houses or whatever my flavor of the week was\u00a0 wasn\u2019t for nothing. In fact, I think I\u2019m going to go ahead and add playing video games to my coping mechanism toolbox. Officially. For real. After the break, we\u2019ll finish up our interview with Jor-El Caraballo and talk about some of the most common coping mechanisms that come up in his work.\n\nMIDROLL\n\nAnna: Hey, welcome back to Mood Ring. I\u2019m Anna Borges. Before the break we were talking about our shitty coping mechanisms, and by that I mean our awesome coping mechanisms that we\u2019re working toward embracing,\u00a0 with licensed therapist Jor-El Caraballo. Let\u2019s get back to it.\n\nAnna: I would actually love to pause like, because we're binge watchers, it sounds like but for people who might not be this might not be like their go to I'm curious if you have any examples of other shame inducing, like, quote, unquote, shitty coping mechanisms that like you hear from from people you work with?\n\nJor-El: Eating, it's right up there. Specifically like comfort food. And it's just so interesting, because, again, like, I come from this mindset that even something like that, like comfort food has definitely gotten this bad rap. Because like, Oh, it's just all the bad things you want to eat. First of all, there are no bad things. Second of all, they they're comforting for a reason, right? Either they provide some chemical reaction that we interpret our bodies interpret as really comforting, or\u2026 and or. We also have attached memories, right? That really put us in a comfortable, safe space emotionally when we revisit with those things. So it's okay. But again, it's like that can't be your only thing. Because then if you're only relying on you know, comfort food to cope, then you might end up creating some other problems that you have to deal with later, that that are unintentional. It's about finding that balance.\n\nAnna: Absolutely. I could talk about complicated relationships to food all day. But what struck me about what you said is that there is a reason that this these things generally make us feel good. So I'm curious, like, even if it's no, we know that we're doing it for a reason. It's like maybe what we need or really want in the moment. Why do we feel guilty about it? Rather than saying like, okay, yeah, this is this is what I need today. I need to binge watch, or I don't know if need is the right word. But this is what sure this is what would feel good to me right now. And I need to feel good.\n\nJor-El: Yeah, I just think that there's so much noise about \u2026one about mental health in general, and about how we respond to it. And so I find that a lot of times I'm having conversations with clients about unpacking the internalized messages that come with, like your chosen coping strategies or coping mechanisms and saying like, Okay, well, you know, maybe there's a part of this that you're relying on or the extent to which you're relying on it, which is unhealthy. But the thing in and of itself isn't all that bad. I think it's about reminding yourself that each and everything has its place. Right? So avoidance has its place, escapism has its place.

There are things that don't serve a larger purpose.\n\nJor-El: It's about sort of turning down the noise on your nervous system. Right?\n\nAnna: Can you expand on that? I can't do that for my nervous system. My nervous system has a mind of its own, it has a volume knob I cannot access or maybe I can. Teach me how.\n\nJor-El: Yeah, my mind stays busy too.

And so really what coping is meant to do, at least in my opinion, is to like kind of like if you had a dimmer, right, you can move that dimmer down and say, like, okay, if I'm like an eight right now, like, this is not good. Can I get to a six and what will help me get to a six, right, or what will help me get to a four, maybe I can journal or maybe I'll take a nap. Or maybe I'll call a friend for some support. And that'll bring that all that, you know, nervous system arousal down, which will help you feel better, and we'll also help you be more functional.\n\nAnna: We, you know, judge ourselves for not being productive or being sedentary. And I wanted to talk about kind of like the inherent like, ableism in this framing, when we think about these things\u2026\n\nJor-El: Yeah, well, and I, I've done my best to not step on a huge soapbox on social about this. So I'll throw out little pieces here and there. Yeah, it's so much of so much of the conversation around coping and stuff is has this looped in? Well, a few things ableism and capitalism, right? That those are big parts of those, like little message that messages that we internalize, about like, Oh, you're supposed you always supposed to be productive? Why? Why? Why must you always be doing something? Right? Also, you are human, you have limitations physically, psychologically? Why are we pretending that we don't? Oh,\u00a0 ableism? Right, because everyone should be achieving a certain level at all times. And everyone has the same capacity. And that's just a lie. And sometimes that is also like the beginning process of that unpacking is we're like, let's tell the truth. The truth is everyone's not the same. The truth is people need different things. The truth is humans need rest. They need coping, they need relief. Everyone does.\n\nAnna: Internalizing those messages takes time. Some days, it still might feel more like, \u201cEveryone needs rest\u2014except me! Everyone needs coping\u2014except me! Everyone needs relief\u2014except me! I need discipline and punishment and guilt!\u201d\n\nBeen there. I push back against that voice by scheduling my shitty coping mechanisms. Not as a way to control myself or cut back\u2014no, I mean, if I think I\u2019m going to need to spend all weekend playing video games and cuddling with my cats, that\u2019s exactly what I put on my calendar. And then my calendar gives me permission. When shame creeps up in the moment, I can remind myself that this is exactly what I planned. This is exactly what I needed.\n\nYou might find scheduling helpful too, or you might need to give yourself permission a different way. Maybe you give yourself permission out loud or write it in a journal or set a text alert or ask a friend to hold you accountable.\n\nThe exact way you give yourself permission isn\u2019t the important part. As Jor-El really drove home, being intentional is the real tool.\n\nJor-El: I think that one of the most powerful tools that we can arm ourselves with it, especially when it comes to coping, is making the choice. There's something really powerful about saying, I'm struggling right now. And I'm choosing to cope in this way. Because I think it offers you one: just the affirmation of your feeling and what you're going through. But it also gives you an opportunity to briefly check in with yourself and say, Oh, is this thing going to give me the thing I'm looking for right now?\n\nAnna: It won\u2019t always be easy to make that choice, or to check in with yourself at all. Luckily, the thing about all this living with intention is that you have to intentionally give yourself permission to fuck up this living intentionally thing. It\u2019s called being human. And maybe that\u2019s what this whole permission thing is really all about\u2014giving ourselves permission to be human.\n\nJust like I\u2019m giving myself permission to say cheesy shit like that, oh god.

Anna talks with therapist Elisa Beagle about a practical tool to start identifying feelings, and why naming feelings can be the first step to addressing and ultimately soothing them on the journey of self-care.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p><strong>Full Transcript</strong></p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna Borges: I\u2019m feeling\u2026 nervous.</p><br/><p>I recognize it pretty well, at this point. My heart is thumping in my throat. My breath is shallow, I\u2019m lightheaded and shaky. My mind is racing with worst-case scenarios and negative self-talk. Just all-around nerves, everywhere.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m feeling nervous. About this podcast.</p><br/><p>I guess I should introduce myself before I introduce this whole existential crisis I\u2019m having. Hello, I\u2019m Anna Borges. Up until about a year ago, I was a full-time mental health writer. I worked at SELF Magazine and, before that, BuzzFeed and through all that freelanced and somewhere along the way, I even wrote a book called <em>The More or Less Definitive Guide to Self-Care</em>.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><br/><p>I generally wrote about the types of things that we can do to take care of our mental health on our own. I interviewed mental health experts to get their best advice and coping mechanisms. And I collected tips from people who had been there. And I wrote about my own personal experience as someone who struggles with, I mean, a lot. But specifically with their mental health. Which\u2013 spoiler-alert\u2013is a lot of what this podcast is going to be too.</p><br/><p>Which is exactly why I\u2019m nervous. Because as you might recall, I just said I <em>used</em> to be a mental health writer. Past tense. There wasn\u2019t One Big Thing that happened to make me stop. It just\u2026slowly but surely wore me down.</p><br/><p>The closest I got to a dramatic realization that it was time to stop was this one week where I was stretched especially thin and just crumpling under the pressure of a million deadlines. I was wrung out, and out of ideas, and I still had a few more stories to write that week. So, I took a shower and I sat on the floor of my tub under the water and I sobbed. I sobbed, yeah.</p><br/><p>And do you know what I did when I was having my little breakdown? Not sit there and feel my feelings. Not any one of the 50 million coping mechanisms I\u2019d written about over the years.</p><br/><p>No, I reached for the pencil and waterproof pad I kept suction-cupped to my shower wall, and I wrote: How Not to Catch a UTI While Crying on the Shower Floor.</p><br/><p>A potential headline. For a story. Or at least a future memoir.</p><br/><p>Because something weird happens when you create content about your mental health for a living. Your mental health <em>becomes</em> your work, and it becomes bound to all the deadlines and quotas and pressures and stresses that come along with it. Coping starts being your job first, and for you second. You stop asking, \u201cHow can I get through this?\u201d and start asking, \u201cHow can I turn this into content?\u201d Eventually it distorts the way you look at your mental health and yourself, because you\u2019re too used to wrapping things up nicely in a shareable, snackable package. Or at least, I was.</p><br/><p>So, I quit. I quit mining my mental health for content.</p><br/><p>So hey, welcome to my mental health podcast, am I right?</p><br/><p>But no. Truth is, things didn\u2019t magically get better just because I stopped writing about my mental health. And I missed this. I miss exploring new tools and coping mechanisms, and I miss connecting with others over needing these tools and coping mechanisms.</p><br/><p>I may not have figured out the secret to shielding my mental health from all the effects of creating content about it. But I did learn that I want to lean into what I missed: the feeling and the trying.</p><br/><p>So yeah. I\u2019m feeling nervous. But I\u2019m also feeling excited. And hopeful. And at least a little more prepared this time.\u00a0</p><br/><p>THEME MUSIC</p><br/><p>This is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings. Every episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope \u2014 with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, and with the world around us. Some episodes I\u2019ll share things that I\u2019ve tried and other episodes we\u2019ll learn new things together from our guests.</p><br/><p>No matter what, though, we won\u2019t act like taking care of your mental health is as simple as learning a few tips and tricks. Mental health is not simple. And neither is taking care of it in a society where access to mental health care and the ability to practice even basic self-care is a huge privilege.</p><br/><p>So, part of being a practical guide to feelings is being a realistic one. And that starts by saying that this show is not about finding the perfect self-care tips or the answers to all of our problems. Because those tips? They don\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a reason I started this episode with how I\u2019m <em>feeling</em>: I mean, A: I just love talking about my feelings. But, also we\u2019re kicking off this podcast with one of the most, honestly, foundational tools that we have: Naming our feelings. And I know that might sound silly. Or at least overly simple. Like, name your feelings. Groundbreaking. Smash cut to sitting on a therapist\u2019s couch while they ask, \u201cAnd how does that make you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>But, I mean, naming our feelings is actually a perfect place for us to start. Because all of the important things that we have to do with our feelings, like feel them and process them and address them and soothe them\u2014all of that starts with identifying them. And do you know what helps us with identifying our feelings? Yeah. Naming them.</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s not always as easy as it sounds \u2013 at least for me. I wanted a larger sample size. So, I brought in our producer Georgie to talk about it.</p><br/><p>Anna: Hey, Georgie.</p><br/><p>Georgie: Hey, Anna.</p><br/><p>Anna: How are you feeling?</p><br/><p>Georgie: Um-how am I feeling? Okay, I feel like, this sort of, like, right in like the-in my diaphragm area, just like there\u2019s a bunch of little, like, beans kind of shaking around. That they\u2019re kind of just like popping. And it\u2019s partially like excitement popping, but also a little anxiety, kind of, feeling.</p><br/><p>Anna: So, you, you asked our team to kind of do the same exercise, AKA just name their feelings. Small exercise, but how\u2019d it go?</p><br/><p>Georgie: It was great. Would you like to hear some?</p><br/><p>Anna: Uh, duh.</p><br/><p>VOX POPS</p><br/><p>I\u2019m feeling tired. Um\u2026 I kinda thought the end of the world would be a bit different\u2026</p><br/><p>I\u2019m feeling slump-y is that a word? It\u2019s that time of the afternoon where I feel a little foggy and tired and unable to focus. So, I call it slump-y. Slump-y is how I feel.</p><br/><p>I feel a sense of hopelessness.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s actually hard to kind of pinpoint how I\u2019m feeling, but I would say that a general sense of feeling overwhelmed.</p><br/><p>Anna: So, what was it like collecting these things?</p><br/><p>Georgie: It was wonderful. I feel like it reminded me of the many different experiences that people are having in this present moment. And listening to the people I work with open up was\u2013I mean, it touched my heart. Literally, it\u2019s just amazing.</p><br/><p>Anna: If that came from my mouth, it would sound so sarcastic. Sincerely, thank you so much for, for A: having these vulnerable conversations with our teammates. And B: talking feelings with me.</p><br/><p>Georgie: I love it, I feel great. Thanks!</p><br/><p>Anna: So, I mean, like we saw in action that naming our feelings can be helpful in a couple different ways. But there are a ton of reasons why it can be so tough to name our feelings.</p><br/><p>For me, a big one is just lacking emotional vocabulary. You know, a lot of us don\u2019t have the right words to describe what we\u2019re feeling. I mean, we know like the broad ones, like mad and sad and happy. But those often fall short, because how often do we only feel mad and sad and happy?</p><br/><p>I did say this was a practical guide to feelings so, luckily, we have a tool for that. We\u2019ll get into it after the break and talk to a therapist about some practical ways we can work through naming our feelings.</p><br/><p>MIDROLL</p><br/><p>Anna: I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring.</p><br/><p>Before the break, we were talking about why it can be so hard to name our feelings. So, as promised, there is a tool that I really, really love for that. And it\u2019s called\u2026 The Feelings Wheel.</p><br/><p>The Feelings Wheel is an actual physical WHEEL! OF! FEELINGS! Or like a pie-chart of feelings, a pizza of feelings. It was originally developed by a psychotherapist named Gloria Wilcox back in the 1980s. And it was a tool for expanding our awareness of our emotions. Just like it is today. And by now, like, there are a million different iterations with different words and different colors by different artists, but essentially most of them follow the same pattern:</p><br/><p>At the center of the circle are our big, foundational, fundamental emotions like mad, sad, joyful. The ones that we tend to be more familiar with. And then each of those emotions branches outwards into more specific emotions. So, sad branches into feelings like lonely, depressed, bored, ashamed. And so on and so forth.</p><br/><p>A lot of therapists use the Feelings Wheel with their clients, including our guest today. Elisa Beagle is a licensed professional counselor, so, a therapist, and I asked her to walk me through how we can use the Feelings Wheel in our day-to-day lives, why we might want to, and what we can do once we\u2019ve found the right words.</p><br/><p>Elisa: I don&#39;t necessarily always pull out the picture, but I kind of help people navigate and go deeper with their emotions. Because again, some people have, you know, the basic feelings you have the anger, the anticipation, joy, trust, fear, surprise. So, you have those, but sometimes to add more vocabulary to their emotions, um, that they may have not learned previously. I kind of use that.</p><br/><p>Anna: Mm, totally. So if someone wanted to use it as a tool in the moment when they were going through an emotional moment and wanted to go through some of the steps you were just talking about and walking through to understand themselves and their emotions, what, what would that process look like? How would you suggest someone use it?</p><br/><p>Elisa: First of all, I would say, okay, hey, what are you feeling? What resonates most with you right now? So, say that some-somebody says, okay, fearful. Um, I would say, okay, like what, why do you, why do you pick fearful? What other word kind of resonates? And it&#39;s like, okay well, maybe it&#39;s, um, you know, I had insecurity. So, the insecurity, um, that I have is like, maybe I don&#39;t feel secure at my job. So, it was okay. We work through that. Um, and then we can go even further into, okay. Um, when you feel insecure, it brings out feelings of inadequacy or inferiority. And why is that? And then we can kind of talk through that. Um, and sometimes you can work through it from the outside-in as well. Like you may feel like, okay, well, I&#39;m feeling a little overwhelmed and we can kind of say, okay, you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed because of what? And I think really what it is, is like really just questioning when you do pick an emotion and that resonates with you kind of question, like, what is it about that emotion, um, that you&#39;re feeling and what are kind, when you break that down, what does that come, come down to?</p><br/><p>Anna: So, if I&#39;m understanding correctly, you can like start in the center with like, kind of like our\u2013we&#39;re most familiar with these emotions, I would say. These are like the big ones where it&#39;s like, oh yeah, I&#39;m mad, I&#39;m happy, I&#39;m afraid. So those can be very accessible. And then you could branch further out to get specific. Or if you have a specific feeling, you might be able to dig back in to find an underlying emotion.</p><br/><p>Elisa: Yeah, and if it\u2019s a good emotion we just wanna flow with it. Like, hey I\u2019m excited, that\u2019s all that matters. Cool. You know? And so it-it takes more to be able to kind of feel like, okay, like, let me dive into this a little bit, you know?</p><br/><p>Anna: Why can it be so difficult to, I don&#39;t know, like understand what we&#39;re feeling? Like, we know that it&#39;s important to understand what we&#39;re feeling, but like what gets in the way of understanding that, let alone naming it?</p><br/><p>Elisa: Cause it&#39;s intense. Right? It&#39;s like, you know, when you think about something, um, even like a good emotion, right, that we like. Excitement, right. Excitement at that moment is like the highlight of what&#39;s going across our mind. Like, it&#39;s like, oh my gosh, I just like won a million dollars. Like, you know, you, you don&#39;t know it&#39;s, you&#39;re not trying to label like, oh, what, what, what would be underlying the excitement in this situation? It&#39;s like, I&#39;m excited, so what&#39;s at the forefront, it&#39;s an intense emotion. It&#39;s booming, like in capital letters, exclamation points, it&#39;s the forefront. So, it really blocks us off from being able to understand anything else on a deeper level, because it&#39;s just intense, you know? And so we&#39;re, we&#39;re just caught up in that, in that one emotion. And so it&#39;s harder to identify anything else that may come with that. Sometimes when we&#39;re over that emotion, if it&#39;s not so great, we don&#39;t even wanna deal with, we don&#39;t wanna go deeper into it.</p><br/><p>Anna: Right. We don&#39;t, we don&#39;t wanna talk about it. No.</p><br/><p>Elisa: Yeah, yeah. And if it&#39;s a good emotion, we just wanna flow with it. Like, Hey, I&#39;m excited. That&#39;s all that matters. Cool. You know?</p><br/><p>Anna: I imagine that&#39;s a common reaction, like why do I have to name my feeling? I feel my feeling, the point of feeling is to experience it. What&#39;s the point in labeling it and it, it actually, yeah. What, what would you say to someone who say\u2013before my follow up question\u2013what would you say to someone who says that?</p><br/><p>Elisa: Well, I think, I think it, it, it, it can be both. It doesn&#39;t have to be either-or, right? I can feel and experience the fullness of that feeling in that moment. This is my feeling, so if that feeling would be\u2026 confusion. Right? Now I want to get out of the confusion, but I also want to understand um, okay, in that moment, like, I just, I\u2019m feeling confused. What-what is confusing me? What are these components that are actually confusing me? Okay, and then I want to move out of that and have some resolve so I understand how to form a solution to what I\u2019m feeling. And then I also can know how to, in the, in the future, resolve things when it comes to this-these like different aspects that are causing the confusion for me.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Anna: So it&#39;s not just an in the moment tool, it&#39;s kind of like building a foundation of understanding about your feelings every time you go through this process.</p><br/><p>Elisa: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like you&#39;re, you&#39;re, you&#39;re understanding yourself as you go through your emotions, their, their navigation towards your self discovery and your growth.</p><br/><p>Anna: Thanks to my old buddy The Feelings Wheel, I\u2019ve actually gotten pretty good at the whole <em>naming</em> part of dealing with my emotions. But I\u2019m still quick to ask, like \u201cOkay, what now? What do I do with the feeling? I named it. What do I do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s something that my therapist winds up telling me a lot, like I\u2019ll tell her I\u2019m feeling a thing and feel proud of myself for, like, naming the word and then I\u2019ll launch into the story of why I feel that way. Or-or if it\u2019s a good day, I\u2019ll investigate what I can learn from the feeling or, like, how I might respond to it. Or more likely, I\u2019ll spiral into how I <em>feel</em> about the feeling\u2014like, I\u2019ll say I feel embarrassed or guilty or silly and like I shouldn\u2019t feel that way.</p><br/><p>And then, when I finally run out of steam, my therapist will pause in that therapy way and say something along the lines of, \u201cI want to return to the feeling and stay there a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>MUSIC</p><br/><p>Because there is a step in the process of naming and recognizing your feelings that doesn\u2019t really feel like a step at all. And that\u2019s <em>allowing</em> for the feeling. It\u2019s sitting with the feeling and letting it just\u2026be. Not judging it or acting on it or even questioning it. Just allowing yourself to feel.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s easy to forget, but that moment is an act of self-compassion and self-care in and of itself.</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s why now that I\u2019ve named that I feel anxious about this podcast, I\u2019m going to stay in that anxious feeling for a moment. I&#39;m allowing myself to feel nervous about this podcast. Mood Ring might be a practical guide to feelings, but it\u2019s also a place where we\u2019re allowing our feelings to exist as they are. Even when they\u2019re complicated and even when there are no practical solutions.</p><br/><p>So, if you named a feeling while we\u2019ve been here, I invite you to stay with it after we\u2019re gone.

            "contentSnippet": "In the first episode of Mood Ring, host and mental health writer Anna Borges digs into one of the most fundamental parts of tending to our emotional well-being: naming your feelings. Anna talks with therapist Elisa Beagle about a practical tool to start identifying feelings, and why naming feelings can be the first step to addressing and ultimately soothing them on the journey of self-care.\n\n\nFull Transcript\n\n\u00a0\nAnna Borges: I\u2019m feeling\u2026 nervous.\n\nI recognize it pretty well, at this point. My heart is thumping in my throat. My breath is shallow, I\u2019m lightheaded and shaky. My mind is racing with worst-case scenarios and negative self-talk. Just all-around nerves, everywhere.\n\nI\u2019m feeling nervous. About this podcast.\n\nI guess I should introduce myself before I introduce this whole existential crisis I\u2019m having. Hello, I\u2019m Anna Borges. Up until about a year ago, I was a full-time mental health writer. I worked at SELF Magazine and, before that, BuzzFeed and through all that freelanced and somewhere along the way, I even wrote a book called The More or Less Definitive Guide to Self-Care.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI generally wrote about the types of things that we can do to take care of our mental health on our own. I interviewed mental health experts to get their best advice and coping mechanisms. And I collected tips from people who had been there. And I wrote about my own personal experience as someone who struggles with, I mean, a lot. But specifically with their mental health. Which\u2013 spoiler-alert\u2013is a lot of what this podcast is going to be too.\n\nWhich is exactly why I\u2019m nervous. Because as you might recall, I just said I used to be a mental health writer. Past tense. There wasn\u2019t One Big Thing that happened to make me stop. It just\u2026slowly but surely wore me down.\n\nThe closest I got to a dramatic realization that it was time to stop was this one week where I was stretched especially thin and just crumpling under the pressure of a million deadlines. I was wrung out, and out of ideas, and I still had a few more stories to write that week. So, I took a shower and I sat on the floor of my tub under the water and I sobbed. I sobbed, yeah.\n\nAnd do you know what I did when I was having my little breakdown? Not sit there and feel my feelings. Not any one of the 50 million coping mechanisms I\u2019d written about over the years.\n\nNo, I reached for the pencil and waterproof pad I kept suction-cupped to my shower wall, and I wrote: How Not to Catch a UTI While Crying on the Shower Floor.\n\nA potential headline. For a story. Or at least a future memoir.\n\nBecause something weird happens when you create content about your mental health for a living. Your mental health becomes your work, and it becomes bound to all the deadlines and quotas and pressures and stresses that come along with it. Coping starts being your job first, and for you second. You stop asking, \u201cHow can I get through this?\u201d and start asking, \u201cHow can I turn this into content?\u201d Eventually it distorts the way you look at your mental health and yourself, because you\u2019re too used to wrapping things up nicely in a shareable, snackable package. Or at least, I was.\n\nSo, I quit. I quit mining my mental health for content.\n\nSo hey, welcome to my mental health podcast, am I right?\n\nBut no. Truth is, things didn\u2019t magically get better just because I stopped writing about my mental health. And I missed this. I miss exploring new tools and coping mechanisms, and I miss connecting with others over needing these tools and coping mechanisms.\n\nI may not have figured out the secret to shielding my mental health from all the effects of creating content about it. But I did learn that I want to lean into what I missed: the feeling and the trying.\n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m feeling nervous. But I\u2019m also feeling excited. And hopeful. And at least a little more prepared this time.\u00a0\n\nTHEME MUSIC\n\nThis is Mood Ring, a practical guide to feelings. Every episode, we\u2019ll explore one new way to cope \u2014 with our feelings, with our baggage, with our brains, and with the world around us. Some episodes I\u2019ll share things that I\u2019ve tried and other episodes we\u2019ll learn new things together from our guests.\n\nNo matter what, though, we won\u2019t act like taking care of your mental health is as simple as learning a few tips and tricks. Mental health is not simple. And neither is taking care of it in a society where access to mental health care and the ability to practice even basic self-care is a huge privilege.\n\nSo, part of being a practical guide to feelings is being a realistic one. And that starts by saying that this show is not about finding the perfect self-care tips or the answers to all of our problems. Because those tips? They don\u2019t exist.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason I started this episode with how I\u2019m feeling: I mean, A: I just love talking about my feelings. But, also we\u2019re kicking off this podcast with one of the most, honestly, foundational tools that we have: Naming our feelings. And I know that might sound silly. Or at least overly simple. Like, name your feelings. Groundbreaking. Smash cut to sitting on a therapist\u2019s couch while they ask, \u201cAnd how does that make you feel?\u201d\n\nBut, I mean, naming our feelings is actually a perfect place for us to start. Because all of the important things that we have to do with our feelings, like feel them and process them and address them and soothe them\u2014all of that starts with identifying them. And do you know what helps us with identifying our feelings? Yeah. Naming them.\n\nBut it\u2019s not always as easy as it sounds \u2013 at least for me. I wanted a larger sample size. So, I brought in our producer Georgie to talk about it.\n\nAnna: Hey, Georgie.\n\nGeorgie: Hey, Anna.\n\nAnna: How are you feeling?\n\nGeorgie: Um-how am I feeling? Okay, I feel like, this sort of, like, right in like the-in my diaphragm area, just like there\u2019s a bunch of little, like, beans kind of shaking around. That they\u2019re kind of just like popping. And it\u2019s partially like excitement popping, but also a little anxiety, kind of, feeling.\n\nAnna: So, you, you asked our team to kind of do the same exercise, AKA just name their feelings. Small exercise, but how\u2019d it go?\n\nGeorgie: It was great. Would you like to hear some?\n\nAnna: Uh, duh.\n\nVOX POPS\n\nI\u2019m feeling tired. Um\u2026 I kinda thought the end of the world would be a bit different\u2026\n\nI\u2019m feeling slump-y is that a word? It\u2019s that time of the afternoon where I feel a little foggy and tired and unable to focus. So, I call it slump-y. Slump-y is how I feel.\n\nI feel a sense of hopelessness.\n\nIt\u2019s actually hard to kind of pinpoint how I\u2019m feeling, but I would say that a general sense of feeling overwhelmed.\n\nAnna: So, what was it like collecting these things?\n\nGeorgie: It was wonderful. I feel like it reminded me of the many different experiences that people are having in this present moment. And listening to the people I work with open up was\u2013I mean, it touched my heart. Literally, it\u2019s just amazing.\n\nAnna: If that came from my mouth, it would sound so sarcastic. Sincerely, thank you so much for, for A: having these vulnerable conversations with our teammates. And B: talking feelings with me.\n\nGeorgie: I love it, I feel great. Thanks!\n\nAnna: So, I mean, like we saw in action that naming our feelings can be helpful in a couple different ways. But there are a ton of reasons why it can be so tough to name our feelings.\n\nFor me, a big one is just lacking emotional vocabulary. You know, a lot of us don\u2019t have the right words to describe what we\u2019re feeling. I mean, we know like the broad ones, like mad and sad and happy. But those often fall short, because how often do we only feel mad and sad and happy?\n\nI did say this was a practical guide to feelings so, luckily, we have a tool for that. We\u2019ll get into it after the break and talk to a therapist about some practical ways we can work through naming our feelings.\n\nMIDROLL\n\nAnna: I\u2019m Anna Borges and this is Mood Ring.\n\nBefore the break, we were talking about why it can be so hard to name our feelings. So, as promised, there is a tool that I really, really love for that. And it\u2019s called\u2026 The Feelings Wheel.\n\nThe Feelings Wheel is an actual physical WHEEL! OF! FEELINGS! Or like a pie-chart of feelings, a pizza of feelings. It was originally developed by a psychotherapist named Gloria Wilcox back in the 1980s. And it was a tool for expanding our awareness of our emotions. Just like it is today. And by now, like, there are a million different iterations with different words and different colors by different artists, but essentially most of them follow the same pattern:\n\nAt the center of the circle are our big, foundational, fundamental emotions like mad, sad, joyful. The ones that we tend to be more familiar with. And then each of those emotions branches outwards into more specific emotions. So, sad branches into feelings like lonely, depressed, bored, ashamed. And so on and so forth.\n\nA lot of therapists use the Feelings Wheel with their clients, including our guest today. Elisa Beagle is a licensed professional counselor, so, a therapist, and I asked her to walk me through how we can use the Feelings Wheel in our day-to-day lives, why we might want to, and what we can do once we\u2019ve found the right words.\n\nElisa: I don't necessarily always pull out the picture, but I kind of help people navigate and go deeper with their emotions. Because again, some people have, you know, the basic feelings you have the anger, the anticipation, joy, trust, fear, surprise. So, you have those, but sometimes to add more vocabulary to their emotions, um, that they may have not learned previously. I kind of use that.\n\nAnna: Mm, totally. So if someone wanted to use it as a tool in the moment when they were going through an emotional moment and wanted to go through some of the steps you were just talking about and walking through to understand themselves and their emotions, what, what would that process look like? How would you suggest someone use it?\n\nElisa: First of all, I would say, okay, hey, what are you feeling? What resonates most with you right now? So, say that some-somebody says, okay, fearful. Um, I would say, okay, like what, why do you, why do you pick fearful? What other word kind of resonates? And it's like, okay well, maybe it's, um, you know, I had insecurity. So, the insecurity, um, that I have is like, maybe I don't feel secure at my job. So, it was okay. We work through that. Um, and then we can go even further into, okay. Um, when you feel insecure, it brings out feelings of inadequacy or inferiority. And why is that? And then we can kind of talk through that. Um, and sometimes you can work through it from the outside-in as well. Like you may feel like, okay, well, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed and we can kind of say, okay, you're feeling overwhelmed because of what? And I think really what it is, is like really just questioning when you do pick an emotion and that resonates with you kind of question, like, what is it about that emotion, um, that you're feeling and what are kind, when you break that down, what does that come, come down to?\n\nAnna: So, if I'm understanding correctly, you can like start in the center with like, kind of like our\u2013we're most familiar with these emotions, I would say. These are like the big ones where it's like, oh yeah, I'm mad, I'm happy, I'm afraid. So those can be very accessible. And then you could branch further out to get specific. Or if you have a specific feeling, you might be able to dig back in to find an underlying emotion.\n\nElisa: Yeah, and if it\u2019s a good emotion we just wanna flow with it. Like, hey I\u2019m excited, that\u2019s all that matters. Cool. You know? And so it-it takes more to be able to kind of feel like, okay, like, let me dive into this a little bit, you know?\n\nAnna: Why can it be so difficult to, I don't know, like understand what we're feeling? Like, we know that it's important to understand what we're feeling, but like what gets in the way of understanding that, let alone naming it?\n\nElisa: Cause it's intense. Right? It's like, you know, when you think about something, um, even like a good emotion, right, that we like. Excitement, right. Excitement at that moment is like the highlight of what's going across our mind. Like, it's like, oh my gosh, I just like won a million dollars. Like, you know, you, you don't know it's, you're not trying to label like, oh, what, what, what would be underlying the excitement in this situation? It's like, I'm excited, so what's at the forefront, it's an intense emotion. It's booming, like in capital letters, exclamation points, it's the forefront. So, it really blocks us off from being able to understand anything else on a deeper level, because it's just intense, you know? And so we're, we're just caught up in that, in that one emotion. And so it's harder to identify anything else that may come with that. Sometimes when we're over that emotion, if it's not so great, we don't even wanna deal with, we don't wanna go deeper into it.\n\nAnna: Right. We don't, we don't wanna talk about it. No.\n\nElisa: Yeah, yeah. And if it's a good emotion, we just wanna flow with it. Like, Hey, I'm excited. That's all that matters. Cool. You know?\n\nAnna: I imagine that's a common reaction, like why do I have to name my feeling? I feel my feeling, the point of feeling is to experience it. What's the point in labeling it and it, it actually, yeah. What, what would you say to someone who say\u2013before my follow up question\u2013what would you say to someone who says that?\n\nElisa: Well, I think, I think it, it, it, it can be both. It doesn't have to be either-or, right? I can feel and experience the fullness of that feeling in that moment. This is my feeling, so if that feeling would be\u2026 confusion. Right? Now I want to get out of the confusion, but I also want to understand um, okay, in that moment, like, I just, I\u2019m feeling confused. What-what is confusing me? What are these components that are actually confusing me? Okay, and then I want to move out of that and have some resolve so I understand how to form a solution to what I\u2019m feeling. And then I also can know how to, in the, in the future, resolve things when it comes to this-these like different aspects that are causing the confusion for me.\u00a0\n\nAnna: So it's not just an in the moment tool, it's kind of like building a foundation of understanding about your feelings every time you go through this process.\n\nElisa: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like you're, you're, you're understanding yourself as you go through your emotions, their, their navigation towards your self discovery and your growth.\n\nAnna: Thanks to my old buddy The Feelings Wheel, I\u2019ve actually gotten pretty good at the whole naming part of dealing with my emotions. But I\u2019m still quick to ask, like \u201cOkay, what now? What do I do with the feeling? I named it.
