Most of all, it asks: what if, in the future, everything breaks humanity's way? Tune in for grounded and speculative takes on how technology\u2014and, in particular, AI\u2014is inspiring change and transforming the future. Hosted by Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger, each episode features an interview with an ambitious builder or deep thinker on a topic, from art to geopolitics and from healthcare to education. These conversations also showcase another kind of guest: AI. Whether it's Inflection\u2019s Pi, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT or other AI tools, each episode will use AI to enhance and advance our discussion about what humanity could possibly get right if we leverage technology\u2014and our collective effort\u2014effectively.",

Possible is off this week but we\u2019re bringing you an episode from another podcast hosted by Reid called Masters of Scale.\u00a0\n\n\nQuestions in this episode include: Are AI\u2019s harshest critics causing irreversible harm to humanity? How far should leaders lean into AI? And just what would Reid sound like speaking Chinese with a British accent?\n\n\nReid Hoffman sits down with CEO of WaitWhat and longtime friend Jeff Berman to tackle these pressing questions and more. Join them in an unguarded exploration of how the AI landscape has continued to shift in the six months since Reid published Impromptu, the book he co-authored with GPT-4.\n\n\nReid also gives a sneak peek into his work with Microsoft's research-only, commercially unreleased AI text-to-speech tech, and discusses why he chose not to join Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and other tech leaders in signing an open letter warning about the existential threat of AI.\n\n\nThis episode was produced by the team at Masters of Scale, the award-winning business podcast hosted by Reid Hoffman. In each episode of Masters of Scale, Reid joins iconic business leaders to unpack their scale journeys, delving into the moments\u2014and mindsets\u2014behind their success.\u00a0\n\n\nFollow Masters of Scale: https://listen.mastersofscale.com/Possible\n\n\nRead a transcript of this episode: https://mastersofscale.com",

Throughout her career, Maja has sought to understand human needs and desires in order to create the right kind of robot. How big should it be? Should it be a humanoid? Animal? Or\u2026 WALL-E? These questions lead to the nature of empathy itself\u2014and what it means for robots to be empathetic. Maja also responds to an AI-generated story that speculates on the role that a socially assistive robot could play for a multigenerational family.\n\n\nRead the transcript of this episode here.\nRead the AI story here.\nFor more info on the podcast and transcripts of all of the episodes, visit www.possible.fm/podcast.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTopics:\n03:30 - What inspired Maja to pursue robotics?\n06:09 - The pop culture perception of \u201cdoomsday robots\u201d\n07:32 - What are socially assistive robots?\n10:20 - How socially assistive robots can enhance our humanity\n12:55 - The relationship between an assistive robot and a human\n16:19 - The hardware side of AI\n20:05 - How our lives would look different with robots in them\n24:06 - Why physically embodied robots are important\n27:42 - AI story about intergenerational family and a robot assistant\n31:16 - How VR/AR can be integrated with AI\n38:34 - Rapidfire questions\n44:10 - Debrief with Reid and Aria\n\n\nPossible is a podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future\u2014and what it will take to get there.

Bryan responds to GPT-4 stories that imagine how new technologies could prevent wrongful convictions and contribute to a better criminal justice system\u2014but are the questions we ask still stuck in carceral logic?\u00a0\n\nRead the AI-generated stories for this episode here.\nRead the transcript of this episode here.\u00a0\nFor more info on the podcast and transcripts of all of the episodes, visit www.possible.fm/podcast.\n\nTopics:\n\n5:37 - Hellos and intros\n6:07 - Defining the criminal justice system and how it has evolved\n11:51 - Where our approach to incarceration has started to shift\n14:39 - GPT-4\u2019s story about addressing minor crimes\n23:45 - GPT-4\u2019s story about reconciling wrongful convictions\n28:28 - Is a world without prisons possible?\n36:36 - The first steps towards criminal justice reform\n39:33 - Progress afoot at the local level\u00a0\n42:36 - Reformulating sentencing and rethinking drug policy\u00a0\n46:15 - Rapidfire questions\n54:50 - Debrief with Reid and Aria\n\nPossible is a new podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future\u2014and what it will take to get there.
