Yes that\u2019s right, this episode features a founder of a bike brand, not a tech brand. Adam Miller\u2019s journey to create Revel Bikes is paved with many ups and many downs, a failed partnership, super scrappy weeks and months traveling the world to find the best manufacturing partners, the latest innovations in suspension tech and modern geometry to hit the mountain biking scene, a strong team that\u2019s been with him every step of the way (many of which are as close as family), and truly some of the best premium bikes available on the market today. BTW, Adam (host) is an owner of a Revel bike \u2014 he has a T1000 colorway Rascal that he\u2019s ridden on downhill trails, all-day epics, and everything in-between. If you enjoy this episode, please us know in the comments. "

Evan has founded several companies in the past, and he\u2019s been in a CEO position for more than 22 years. But InfluxData was founded by Paul Dix, and Paul knew years ago that his role (best role?) was to lead the technical and product direction of the company, which lead him to Evan.
