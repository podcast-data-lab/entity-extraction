In their most recent episode, Amanda goes over some helpful principles of financial intimacy for couples\u2014things she thinks about when counseling\u00a0couples towards healthy financial behaviors, and\u00a0tips you can\u00a0use in your own relationship. It\u2019s available wherever you listen, and at npr.org/lifekit.",

It's called Let's Talk About Hard Things, and in front of a live (Zoom) audience, we talked together about why I've built my career on having tough conversations\u2014and all the life stuff that led up to making that leap.\u00a0\n\r\nNoel and I first met\u00a0more than a decade ago, back to when I was still\u00a0married to my first husband. \"You and I were supposed to go to Washington D.C. on a reporting trip together,\" Noel remembered during our conversation.\u00a0\"And I remember maybe a day before we were supposed to go...you walked over to my desk and you said very quietly, 'I cannot come to Washington, D.C. I need to stay in town this weekend and work on my marriage.'\"\u00a0\n\r\nI talk together with Noel about the\u00a0hard conversations that led to the eventual end of that relationship (and the eventful summer that followed), and the ones\u00a0that\u00a0helped build the foundation of my second marriage. And, I talk with Noel about\u00a0why I believe it's important to engage in personal, vulnerable conversations both with people inside our orbits\u2014and people vastly different than ourselves.\n\r\n\u2014\n\r\nHear more from Noel King on Death, Sex & Money, in the episode\u00a0she reported about reparations to Chicago police torture victims, and in our 2017 conversation together about workplace harassment, including at WNYC.",

            "contentSnippet": "Donna Perry, who lives in Brooklyn, recovered from COVID-19 a year ago. That\u2019s when producer Yasmeen Khan first interviewed Donna for a news story. At that point, Donna had lost several people to COVID.\u00a0And as the virus spread through New York City\u00a0during the past year, she lost many more. Donna estimates that she\u2019s been to at least 15 funerals on Zoom\u2014all deaths related to the coronavirus\u2014mostly for her fellow members of Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Brooklyn. And she's also grieving the loss of one of her best friends, Selisha. They\u00a0had been close since childhood and talked on the phone every morning.\u00a0\u00a0\n\r\nStill, Donna is adamant about what she calls the \u201cblessings of COVID.\u201d She\u2019s had a chance, she says, to hunker down with her family, to refresh her marriage, and to think with clarity on what\u2019s most important to her. Donna caught up with Yasmeen over Zoom a couple of weeks ago. \"I'm really starting to believe that now more than anything, that every day that I have is a gift and I have a responsibility to live my life in purpose,\" she said.\u00a0\n\r\n\r\nDonna learned the importance of picking up the phone and calling her loved ones this year. So we're inviting people to do this together on Friday, March 26. We've\u00a0declared this day \u201cPick Up the Phone and Call Day.\u201d If there's someone you've been meaning to call\u00a0in the past year, get on it.

So pay me.\"\u00a0\n\r\nWhile Miguel wanted to make sure he was compensated for his work,\u00a0he also told me that he's been reexamining his relationship to performing. \"There's a whole other part of me that\u2019s like, do I ever want to tour again, actually?\" he told me. \"I actually crave certain kinds of normalcy that are just part of other people's lives.\" We talked about the years it took for him to learn how to manage his finances as someone living gig-to-gig, how getting sober helped him get out of years of debt, and how he was able to make ends meet this year.",

According to Census Bureau estimates, the number of people over 65 in the U.S. will nearly double over the next 40 years. They\u2019re also working later, living alone more frequently, and facing financial hardship. And of course, there\u2019s now the pandemic. 80% of COVID-related deaths in the United States have been among people over 65. I see these statistics a lot, but I don\u2019t hear much about what it\u2019s like to <em>be</em> over 60.

But unlike Sonia Manzano's father, who lived well into his 80s, the Justice's father died when she was nine years old. \"I\u2019ve often wondered if the outcome of my life would have been the same if my father had remained alive,\" the Justice says. \"I think the absence of that constant battle made a big difference in my self-perceptions.\"\n\r\nSonia asks the Justice about facing\u00a0and overcoming\u00a0insecurities throughout her life\u2014including on her first day as a\u00a0Supreme Court Justice. \"Anyone presented with a new challenge has to always have that moment of insecurity, of not knowing whether they can do it,\" the Justice says. \"I live with that.

            "contentSnippet": "When author Carmen Maria Machado was in her mid-20s, she had her first relationship with a woman. She was in graduate school at the time, and in the beginning, her ex made her feel special. \"I just wanted somebody to like, look at me and be like, 'I want you,' you know? And that's exactly what she did,\" she told me. While Carmen says the relationship quickly became abusive,\u00a0she was only able to start describing it that way\u00a0once\u00a0their relationship ended.\n\r\nCarmen went on to chronicle this relationship and how she deals with its aftermath in her new, critically-acclaimed memoir In the Dream House. She sat down with me to talk about coming to terms with the relationship, and complicating common narratives around abuse.\n\r\nYou can find the fact sheet Carmen mentioned in the episode here. It was put together by Hyejin Shim and Graywolf Press specifically for queer survivors of abuse, but it offers insights and resources that are useful for everyone.",

But they don't often talk about the aftermath, and how they and their partners decide\u00a0what comes next.</p>\r\n<p>When I\u00a0asked you to send in your stories about infidelity, I heard from so many of you. Listener Sasha* told us about how she suspected that her partner of five years was having an affair -- and later, after they broke up, discovered that he\u00a0had been been posting online ads for casual sex throughout their relationship.

Growing up, he says that his father would often become physically abusive\u00a0when he drank too much. And Michael knows that he\u00a0too is capable of extreme anger while drinking. \"I am still human and thus susceptible to falling into patterns of those who have come before me,\" Michael says. \"I'm reminded that\u00a0[drinking] can lead to something else.\"\u00a0\n\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Michael wrote a piece for The New York Times Opinion section called The Student Loan Serenity Prayer, about\u00a0his student loan debt.\u00a0Read it here.",

It was a gift from a boyfriend who\u00a0turned out to be \"manipulative,\" but\u00a0it launched her into a career that's made her a MacArthur Fellow and the first black woman to have a retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum.\n\r\nAs she tells this week's guest host, author\u00a0Tayari Jones,\u00a0her professional drive has always been the barometer against which she's measured her personal relationships. \"If I'm entering a relationship [and] struggling around notions of my ability to work, then it's not a relationship that I can stay in,\" she says. \"I already see the handwriting is on the wall.\" Together, they talk about balancing that ambition with the relationships in their lives that matter. Plus, Carrie explains why she drank someone else's champagne\u00a0on her wedding day.\n\r\n\r\nThis episode is part of Death, Sex & Money's 2019 Maternity Leave Lineup.\u00a0Tayari Jones first joined us on the show in 2018\u00a0to talk about the freedoms of singlehood, and the call from Oprah that changed everything for her.",
