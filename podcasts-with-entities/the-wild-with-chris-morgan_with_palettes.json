Join him on new adventures from around the Pacific Northwest and the world. He\u2019ll take you through the Irish countryside to learn how one endangered species is helping another endangered species to thrive. \nWe will follow the journey of two young bear cubs as they gain strength at a wildlife rehabilitation center after the tragic death of their mother. And we will learn about the healing powers of nature as we talk to one man who is using bees to recover from the loss of his brother. \nSeason 5 of The Wild will be full of the great storytelling you\u2019ve come to love, from the songs of Orcas, snake hunting in Florida, and how the coyote conquered North America.",

            "contentSnippet": "Like so many carnivores around the world, through history the Iberian lynx was persecuted as a menace or a threat to livestock and lifestyle: they were shot, poisoned, trapped, hunted. And misunderstood.\nThe cats have those really characteristic long tufted ears, black spots dappled across their tawny coat and an old fashioned beard that can stretch down in two long triangles each side of their chin.\nBut despite it\u2019s regal flare, it\u2019s still endangered, and a real focus of attention. But things are turning around, there used to be only around 100 lynx in Spain but now there are nearly 1000.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to Spain - to figure out what is behind that success story - just how did what used to be the rarest cat on earth leap a staggering 1000% in number in just 20 years?\nLearn more about efforts to save the Iberian Lynx with CBD Habitat.\nThe WILD is a joint production of myself and KUOW Public Radio.
