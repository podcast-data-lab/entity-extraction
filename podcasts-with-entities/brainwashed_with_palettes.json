    "description": "Brainwashed investigates the CIA\u2019s covert mind control experiments \u2013 from the Cold War and MKULTRA to the so-called War on Terror. It\u2019s the story of how a renowned psychiatrist used his unwitting patients as human guinea pigs at a Montreal hospital, and the ripple effects on survivors, their families, and thousands of other people around the world. It also examines the cultural impact \u2014 how the CIA brought LSD to America and inadvertently created counterculture influencers such as author Ken Kesey and poet Allen Ginsberg. It\u2019s an exploration of what happens in times of fear, when the military and medicine collide. And what happens when the survivors fight back.\n\nFor the best in true crime from CBC, ad-free, visit apple.co/cbctruecrime.",

It\u2019s the story of how a renowned psychiatrist used his unwitting patients as human guinea pigs at a Montreal hospital, and the ripple effects on survivors, their families, and thousands of other people around the world. It also examines the cultural impact \u2014 how the CIA brought LSD to America and inadvertently created counterculture influencers such as author Ken Kesey and poet Allen Ginsberg. It\u2019s an exploration of what happens in times of fear, when the military and medicine collide. And what happens when the survivors fight back.\n\nFor the best in true crime from CBC, ad-free, visit apple.co/cbctruecrime."
