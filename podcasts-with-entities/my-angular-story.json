They compare React and AngularJS.</p>\n\n<p>They also talk about the evolution of My Angular Story and how the show helped Charles learn more Angular. My Angular Story paved the way for more other Angular podcasts such as Angular Air.</p>\n\n<p>Charles and Aaron invite community to tweet to them if they are more agnostic or if they are more framework specific. They also talk about Charles&#39; new book &quot;The MaxCoders Guide To Finding Your Dream Developer Job&quot; that was published on Amazon and became a #1 New Release in several Career and Job Hunting lists. In the book Charles gives a step by step guide on how to find a job as a developer that you will love. One of the tips Charles gives is to specialize, whatever you want to be working on be the expert or the &quot;go to guy&quot; in that area. So if you are working in Angular learn everything there is to know about Angular.</p>\n\n<h3>Host: Aaron Frost</h3>\n\n<h3>Joined By Special Guest : <strong>Charles Max Wood</strong></h3>\n\n<h2><strong>My Angular Story is produced by DevChat.TV in partnership with Hero Devs</strong></h2>\n\n<h3>Sponsors</h3>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"http://sentry.io/\">Sentry</a> | Use the code &ldquo;devchat&rdquo; for $100 credit</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adventures-in-devops/\">Adventures in DevOps Podcast</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com/\">Cachefly</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>____________________________________________________________</strong></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&quot;The MaxCoders Guide to Finding Your Dream Developer Job&quot; by Charles Max Wood is now available on Amazon.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081MBL5C9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=devchattv-20&amp;linkId=9d61363241636e2546ef46abba198746&amp;language=en_US\"><strong>Get Your Copy Today!</strong></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><strong>____________________________________________________________</strong></h2>\n\n<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Links</h3>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cmaxw\">Charles Max Wood Twitter</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronfrost\">Aaron Frost Twitter</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Picks</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Charles Max Wood:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MaxCoders-Guide-Finding-Dream-Developer-ebook/dp/B081MBL5C9/ref=zg_bsnr_154841011_5?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=KT2EEKNN9ZGVQMPT2J3G\">The MaxCoders Guide To Finding Your Dream Developer Job by Charles Max Wood</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039190/\">The Bishop&#39;s Wife</a>- Christmas Movie</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034862/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3\">Holiday Inn</a> - Christmas Movie</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Frost:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://angular.io/guide/releases\">Angular 9</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>People Who Like Musicals - Next year&#39;s ng-conf will have a musical theme</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChloeCondon?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Chloe Condon</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n \n",

                "summary": "\n        <p>Today Aaron Frost welcomes a very cool guest on My Angular Story, Aaron Ma who is an 11 year old software and hardware developer. Aaron mainly focuses on on web development, self driving cars, flying cars, robotics, Python, C++ and machine learning.</p>\n\n<p>Aaron started programming at the age of 5 by teaching himself HTML by watching YouTube videos. He then continued with an Introduction to CSS course. Aaron&#39;s father who is a full stack developer also encouraged and helped in his coding journey. Aaron Frost asks Aaron if he can remember what he learned from the first HTML video he watched and whether he thought it was hard to learn.</p>\n\n<p>Aaron Frost asks Aaron for tips on how parents can teach their kids how to program. Because Aaron has such an extensive background with programming already at age 11, Aaron Frost also wants to know how much and how Aaron&#39;s dad was involved with Aaron&#39;s learning process.</p>\n\n<p>Aaron Frost then wants to know how Aaron taught himself TensorFlow as well as what the developer community can do to support young developers such as himself. Finally Aaron Frost wants to know more about Aaron&#39;s interest in self-driving vehicles and whether he considers getting good grades a priority.</p>\n\n<h3>Host: Aaron Frost</h3>\n\n<h3>Joined By Special Guest : <strong>Aaron Ma</strong></h3>\n\n<h2><strong>My Angular Story is produced by DevChat.TV in partnership with Hero Devs</strong></h2>\n\n<h3>Sponsors</h3>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"http://sentry.io/\">Sentry</a> | Use the code &ldquo;devchat&rdquo; for $100 credit</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adventures-in-devops/\">Adventures in DevOps Podcast</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com/\">Cachefly</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>____________________________________________________________</strong></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&quot;The MaxCoders Guide to Finding Your Dream Developer Job&quot; by Charles Max Wood is now available on Amazon.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081MBL5C9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=devchattv-20&amp;linkId=9d61363241636e2546ef46abba198746&amp;language=en_US\"><strong>Get Your Copy Today!</strong></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><strong>____________________________________________________________</strong></h2>\n\n<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Links</h3>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-h-ma/\">Aaron&#39;s LinkedIn</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.aaronhma.com/\">Aaron&#39;s Website</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronhma\">Aaron&#39;s Twitter</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n      "

Kevin specializes in cyber security and e-mail security. At InfraShield they specialize in cyber physical security in critical infrastructures.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin explains what cyber physical security entails and how it is different than IT security. It includes both information security and operational security including a wide spectrum from computer access to building access.</p>\n\n<p>Bridging both physical and cyber space security requires Kevin to use a lot of Angular but Angular is only one of the 40 languages Kevin uses in his job.

Brad then talks about the projects he is working on right now and what he is planning to work on in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Host:</strong> Aaron Frost</p>\n\n<p><strong>Joined By Special Guest:</strong> Brad McAlister</p>\n\n<h2><strong>My Angular Story is produced by DevChat.TV in partnership with Hero Devs</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>Sponsors</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"http://sentry.io/\">Sentry</a>&ndash; use the code &ldquo;devchat&rdquo; for two months free on Sentry&rsquo;s small plan</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adventures-in-blockchain/\">Adventures in Blockchain</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com/\">CacheFly</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Links</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradmcalister/\">Brad&#39;s LinkedIn</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sonicparke\">Brad&#39;s Twitter</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.sapphire-digital.com/smartshopper/\">SmartShopper</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Picks</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Frost:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>TypeScript 3.7 optional chaining feature</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Brad McAlister:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://nx.dev\">Nx</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/\">Adventures in Angular</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n      "

When he graduated from college, he didn&rsquo;t have a very high GPA so got an internship at a startup so he could learn web development.

To start out how did you get into programming?</p>\n\n<p>2:03 &ndash; Sharon: I have a Bachelor&rsquo;s of Fine Arts. The web wasn&rsquo;t a thing, yet, and it wasn&rsquo;t an option.</p>\n\n<p>4:04 &ndash; Chuck: How did you go from there to Angular and JavaScript?</p>\n\n<p>4:12 &ndash; Sharon: I have a soft spot in my heart for Code Fusion. I did Code Fusion and PHP and that paid the bills for a long time. In the mid-2000&rsquo;s that some of this stuff was going away and the idea of &ldquo;old is new.&rdquo; What is going to be my evolution of a developer?

I am still using Angular!\n1:37 \u2013 Chuck: It\u2019s nice to hear people\u2019s backgrounds and their thought process. Let\u2019s talk about your story. To start out how did you get into programming?\n2:03 \u2013 Sharon: I have a Bachelor\u2019s of Fine Arts. The web wasn\u2019t a thing, yet, and it wasn\u2019t an option.\n4:04 \u2013 Chuck: How did you go from there to Angular and JavaScript?\n4:12 \u2013 Sharon: I have a soft spot in my heart for Code Fusion. I did Code Fusion and PHP and that paid the bills for a long time. In the mid-2000\u2019s that some of this stuff was going away and the idea of \u201cold is new.\u201d What is going to be my evolution of a developer? The frameworks (at this time) were starting to mature.\n8:01 \u2013 Chuck: You run an Angular Meetup, so how did that get started?\u00a0\n8:05 \u2013 Sharon shares her story.\n9:25 \u2013 Chuck: I would like to find a group that does this or that \u2013 and people find their niche and get together. If it grows great \u2013 if not then you begin some great friendships. I would like room for more intimate Meetups.\n10:18 \u2013 Chuck.\n10:23 \u2013 Sharon.\n10:27 \u2013 Chuck: You spoke at NG-Conf in 2014 and what are your tips for people who want to speak at these conferences.\n10:50 \u2013 Sharon: Get experience talking in front of large audiences before the ACTUAL conference! Also, start with Meetups!\n12:29 \u2013 Chuck: Just the practice of building good habits and making sure that you are really prepared. Don\u2019t they offer coaching now?\n12:45 \u2013 Sharon: Yep!\n12:53 \u2013 Chuck: What other things have you done with Angular?\n13:01 \u2013 Sharon: I have been mostly in applications.

Learning how to ask a question well is underestimated \u2013 it\u2019s an art. What to provide, so you know exactly what to provide to him/her.\n22:21 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah my brothers\n22:47 \u2013 Sharon: My father told me the same thing: you need to speak well and write well.

He has a degree from KU in computer engineering. They discuss how Joel made a career change in his mid-thirties and hasn&rsquo;t looked back since! Listen to today&rsquo;s episode to hear more about Joel&rsquo;s background and current projects!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>In particular, we dive pretty deep on: </strong></p>\n\n<p>0:00 &ndash; Advertisement: <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\">Get A Coder Job!</a></p>\n\n<p>0:51 &ndash; Chuck: I am talking with Joel &ndash; introduce yourself, please!</p>\n\n<p>1:00 &ndash; Joel: I am an Angular developer on the front end. I am employed with a company and working on a new app that has to do with security. I am building the front end to that product. I was studying computer engineering at KU, and Angular is my favorite.</p>\n\n<p>2:00 &ndash; Chuck: How did you get into programming?</p>\n\n<p>2:04 &ndash; Joel: I have always been fascinated with computers. I struggled with mathematics and science in primary school and so I steered away from those topics; therefore my first degree is English literature. Then I fell intro IT support accidentally. Back in 2006 I went through my 2<sup>nd</sup> layoff in my career. My friend asked whether or not I would go back to school, so I did! I went to get my engineering degree and relocated to KU. It took 9 years to get my 2<sup>nd</sup> degree, because I was working fulltime. When I was graduating I talked to an instructor; he mentioned JavaScript at that time. It was exploding in the world at that time. Then I got my first job downtown Kansas City. I haven&rsquo;t looked back ever since. Have you heard about Knockout? I don&rsquo;t get the impression that Knockout is popular anymore? (Chuck: No it&rsquo;s not popular anymore.) I learned Angular and what I like the most about it is that I love how flexible and robust it was/is.</p>\n\n<p>6:32 &ndash; Chuck: You found JavaScript and then found Angular &ndash; first people to get to Ionic from Angular. How did you get to that point?</p>\n\n<p>6:54 &ndash; Joel: Good question! I was fairly new to that job. People already had exposure to it throughout the team/team members.</p>\n\n<p>7:57 &ndash; Chuck: How was your transition from Angular 1 to Angular 2?</p>\n\n<p>8:04 &ndash; Joel: I was never married to it. I do think that Angular 2 was a major step-up for me and was an important change that needed to happen. It was based on the same concepts.</p>\n\n<p>8:39 &ndash; Chuck: What work in Angular are you most proud of?</p>\n\n<p>8:42 &ndash; Joel: I think the application I am working on now b/c it looks THE best! Among other things, too. I volunteer through an organization that puts together tech projects for local governments. I got involved with them b/c I wanted more real world experience. It revolves around city streetlights.</p>\n\n<p>11:03 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah, Code for America I&rsquo;ve heard before! Sounds neat!</p>\n\n<p>11:18 &ndash; Joel: I would recommend it especially if you are trying to break-into the field. I think community outreach is honorable and it shows initiative.</p>\n\n<p>12:06 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah I need to put this into my Get A Coder job</p>\n\n<p>12:23 &ndash; Joel: I have met coders within this realm and it&rsquo;s a great networking opportunity!</p>\n\n<p>12:35 &ndash; Chuck: What are you working on now?</p>\n\n<p>12:37 &ndash; Joel: <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/create/?utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;keyword=wordpress&amp;creative=277412335409&amp;campaignid=998785131&amp;adgroupid=53026924047&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;sgmt=gb&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_campaign=Google_WPcom_Search_Brand_Desktop_US_en&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;keyword=wordpress&amp;creative=277412335409&amp;campaignid=998785131&amp;adgroupid=53026924047&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;targetid=kwd-295456403946&amp;locationid=9027276&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5MLype6Y3wIVCwBpCh2mvQHgEAAYASAAEgI9bvD_BwE\">WordPress</a> development!</p>\n\n<p>13:46 &ndash; Joel (continues): Most lawyers don&rsquo;t have a website b/c they don&rsquo;t want to dabble with the technology.</p>\n\n<p>13:59 &ndash; Chuck: Cool! I think it&rsquo;s important to note that your 1<sup>st</sup> degree was literature and you went back to school. For my mom she went back, too. Were you older than the other students?</p>\n\n<p>14:35 &ndash; Joel: I have a lot of things that went my way, which I was very blessed. The law firm that I worked for they had a huge support for people getting their degrees. They also gave me the flex hours, too! I am glad that I had that set-up and I know I was extremely blessed to have that support. It&rsquo;s hard for people to work fulltime and to go to school &ndash; it&rsquo;s definitely a challenge! I am stoked about veterans getting into the coder field and people with diverse backgrounds into this field; it&rsquo;s very neat!</p>\n\n<p>18:23 &ndash; Chuck: How old were you when you made that career change?</p>\n\n<p>18:36 &ndash; Joel: In my mid/late thirties!</p>\n\n<p>18:39 &ndash; Chuck: People think that they CAN&rsquo;T go back to school b/c they are too &ldquo;old&rdquo; &ndash; when that&rsquo;s not the case!

Listen to today\u2019s episode to hear more about Joel\u2019s background and current projects!\u00a0\nIn particular, we dive pretty deep on: \n0:00 \u2013 Advertisement: Get A Coder Job!\n0:51 \u2013 Chuck: I am talking with Joel \u2013 introduce yourself, please!\n1:00 \u2013 Joel: I am an Angular developer on the front end. I am employed with a company and working on a new app that has to do with security. I am building the front end to that product. I was studying computer engineering at KU, and Angular is my favorite.\n2:00 \u2013 Chuck: How did you get into programming?\n2:04 \u2013 Joel: I have always been fascinated with computers. I struggled with mathematics and science in primary school and so I steered away from those topics; therefore my first degree is English literature. Then I fell intro IT support accidentally. Back in 2006 I went through my 2nd layoff in my career. My friend asked whether or not I would go back to school, so I did! I went to get my engineering degree and relocated to KU. It took 9 years to get my 2nd degree, because I was working fulltime. When I was graduating I talked to an instructor; he mentioned JavaScript at that time. It was exploding in the world at that time. Then I got my first job downtown Kansas City. I haven\u2019t looked back ever since. Have you heard about Knockout? I don\u2019t get the impression that Knockout is popular anymore? (Chuck: No it\u2019s not popular anymore.) I learned Angular and what I like the most about it is that I love how flexible and robust it was/is.\n6:32 \u2013 Chuck: You found JavaScript and then found Angular \u2013 first people to get to Ionic from Angular. How did you get to that point?\n6:54 \u2013 Joel: Good question! I was fairly new to that job. People already had exposure to it throughout the team/team members.\n7:57 \u2013 Chuck: How was your transition from Angular 1 to Angular 2?\n8:04 \u2013 Joel: I was never married to it. I do think that Angular 2 was a major step-up for me and was an important change that needed to happen. It was based on the same concepts.\n8:39 \u2013 Chuck: What work in Angular are you most proud of?\n8:42 \u2013 Joel: I think the application I am working on now b/c it looks THE best! Among other things, too. I volunteer through an organization that puts together tech projects for local governments. I got involved with them b/c I wanted more real world experience. It revolves around city streetlights.\n11:03 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah, Code for America I\u2019ve heard before! Sounds neat!\n11:18 \u2013 Joel: I would recommend it especially if you are trying to break-into the field. I think community outreach is honorable and it shows initiative.\n12:06 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah I need to put this into my Get A Coder job\n12:23 \u2013 Joel: I have met coders within this realm and it\u2019s a great networking opportunity!\n12:35 \u2013 Chuck: What are you working on now?\n12:37 \u2013 Joel: WordPress development!\n13:46 \u2013 Joel (continues): Most lawyers don\u2019t have a website b/c they don\u2019t want to dabble with the technology.\n13:59 \u2013 Chuck: Cool! I think it\u2019s important to note that your 1st degree was literature and you went back to school. For my mom she went back, too. Were you older than the other students?\n14:35 \u2013 Joel: I have a lot of things that went my way, which I was very blessed. The law firm that I worked for they had a huge support for people getting their degrees. They also gave me the flex hours, too! I am glad that I had that set-up and I know I was extremely blessed to have that support. It\u2019s hard for people to work fulltime and to go to school \u2013 it\u2019s definitely a challenge! I am stoked about veterans getting into the coder field and people with diverse backgrounds into this field; it\u2019s very neat!\n18:23 \u2013 Chuck: How old were you when you made that career change?\n18:36 \u2013 Joel: In my mid/late thirties!\n18:39 \u2013 Chuck: People think that they CAN\u2019T go back to school b/c they are too \u201cold\u201d \u2013 when that\u2019s not the case! I encourage people to give it a shot.\u00a0\n19:33 \u2013 Joel: There is never a better time to get into this work than now.\n20:39 \u2013 Chuck: Where can people find you online?\n20:45 \u2013 Joel: At my website \u2013 Stringly Typed!

I&rsquo;m excited!</p>\n\n<p>1:02 &ndash; Chuck: What are you doing now?</p>\n\n<p>1:10 &ndash; Guest: I spent 2.5 years at <a href=\"https://auth0.com\">Auth0</a> and learned a ton there. I was doing some side work and then figured out I had to focus on one thing or the other. Now I have been a consultant fulltime and also teaching, too. AngularCast.io I teach there.</p>\n\n<p>1:56 &ndash; Chuck: Sounds like people are excited about GraphQL. I&rsquo;ve been there, too, and make a similar decision.</p>\n\n<p>2:19 &ndash; Guest: It was a hard decision b/c I liked all of my colleagues there. I always had the itch to be self-employed.</p>\n\n<p>2:42 &ndash; Chuck: You figure out of it&rsquo;s for you or not.</p>\n\n<p>2:51 &ndash; Guest: Yep! I am happy to be another year of it.</p>\n\n<p>3:00 &ndash; Chuck: I went free-lanced about a year ago b/c the decision was made for me.</p>\n\n<p>3:29 &ndash; Guest: I am grateful for it.</p>\n\n<p>3:40 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah, we talk about this a lot on one of my podcast platforms. If you can make a connection with people then you&rsquo;ll be god.</p>\n\n<p>4:07 &ndash; Guest: Yeah I had to figure out if I would have to focus on the marketing side of things or not. Right now the projects are coming to me &ndash; right to my front door, which is great! It&rsquo;s this ever-expanding web.</p>\n\n<p>4:55 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah where people tend to show-up. Let&rsquo;s talk about your story! How did you get into programming?</p>\n\n<p>5:30 &ndash; Guest: It was a little less typically at the time. I was fully self-taught. I went to school for a somewhat Geography degree. It got boring for me at some point. I had to do one programming course while in school and it was in Java. I was terrible at it and I didn&rsquo;t have a clue what I was doing. It didn&rsquo;t help that the instruction wasn&rsquo;t great. I was terrible I didn&rsquo;t understand a thing. I was scared that I was going to fail the course. I came out of there feeling like I didn&rsquo;t have the chops to be a programmer. I was doing Geomantic-stuff. I learned that the further you get into this programming stuff you would make better money &ndash; better job, etc. I was trying to put this map/graph into a website and it said that I had to learn Java. This time, though, the material was taught to me in these small increments. I got into it more and I was more attracted to the idea of programming.</p>\n\n<p>10:00 &ndash; <em>Guest continues.</em></p>\n\n<p>10:32 &ndash; Guest: I was learning Angular and JavaScript better.</p>\n\n<p>10:35 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah it makes you think through it. You have to go deep.</p>\n\n<p>10:47 &ndash; Guest: I would make a sample packet. I would get to certain points and get to a point and I couldn&rsquo;t explain what I did. I would get to a roadblock and I couldn&rsquo;t explain it. I would be on this tangent for a while and have to figure this out. I was working with the government, at this time, but I thought: maybe I could try this programming thing for a while. Did you go to NG Vegas conference?</p>\n\n<p>12:20 &ndash; Chuck: Nope.</p>\n\n<p>12:25 &ndash; Guest: There is this conference in Las Vegas &ndash; I am going to go and hang out with people. At this conference I met some important people. This company posted that they needed someone and I thought: this is the job for me. I sent an email &ndash; went to an interview &ndash; and did an example. I got the job and freaked out because I wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;real&rdquo; programmer. I wrote some content for them and it&rsquo;s been all good.</p>\n\n<p>14:07 &ndash; Chuck: Let me back-up real quickly. How did you find Angular?</p>\n\n<p>14:18 &ndash; Guest: It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint the &ldquo;moment&rdquo; I had found Angular. As I am learning through Code Academy I am reading articles and stuff. I heard about Angular.js and watched some online tutorials and watched all of the talks from the conference. I thought that I needed to learn it b/c it was pretty popular at the time. I knew how to write JavaScript, but made me clearly see with Angular.js app I had to back up and learn it.</p>\n\n<p>15:34 &ndash; Chuck: Yep!</p>\n\n<p>16:05 &ndash; <em>The guest mentions Hacker News among other things. </em></p>\n\n<p>16:22 &ndash; Chuck: Angular and Electron is what we brought you on for &ndash; is that what you are doing?</p>\n\n<p>16:36 &ndash; Guest: The guest talks about his experiences with Angular and Electron.</p>\n\n<p>18:26 &ndash; Chuck: Let&rsquo;s backup some more &ndash; didn&rsquo;t sound like you worked with a lot of tech companies right?</p>\n\n<p>18:51 &ndash; Guest: Yep that was my only one.</p>\n\n<p>18:57 &ndash; Chuck: I hear a lot of complaints from people having this imposter syndrome. You only being in the industry for a short amount of time &ndash; how did you overcome the imposter syndrome?</p>\n\n<p>19:34 &ndash; Guest: Imposter syndrome has been an issue for me &ndash; I wasn&rsquo;t crippled &ndash; but it&rsquo;s debilitating. &ldquo;Who am I to teach on this subject?&rdquo; &ndash; but I think I&rsquo;ve made conscious efforts to ignore that and to use it as a little bit as fuel. I remember, man, of being scarred! I remember being terrified to see the online comments &ndash; b/c they are going to &ldquo;know&rdquo; that I don&rsquo;t know what I am talking about. Funny thing is that I had a lot of positive comments. Little-by-little, those positive pieces of feedback were good for me. I thought: At least I am helping people (like I said, little-by-little!). I think there has been a part of a loop there. If you can look for that feedback it can help overcome imposter syndrome. The things of value are the things that scare you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>22:41 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah, I talk about this all the time to people. I have been self-employed for 8.5 years. I am not going to starve. If I had to, I could go and find a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; job.</p>\n\n<p>23:20 &ndash; Guest: I agree. One piece of feedback that I got from a colleague is that she said: you are very resourceful! Knowing that it helped b/c it was a boost of confidence. If I had this capacity of being resourceful that helped me make my decision. It wasn&rsquo;t a good time in the sense that we just had a baby. If it went south then I could always go back and get a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; job.</p>\n\n<p>24:43 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah we talk about that in Agile development &ndash; the further you go the more information you get.</p>\n\n<p>24:58 &ndash; Guest. Yep</p>\n\n<p>25:03 &ndash; Chuck: What are you doing now?</p>\n\n<p>25:07 &ndash; Guest: I&rsquo;ve had a few large clients these past few years. I have current projects going now one is with a museum. I am speaking at a few conferences &ndash; one of them was in San Francisco and Prague. Now I am planning for next year and figuring out what my teaching and speaking plans will be. It looks like I am focusing on Graph QL content. Lots of Angular, too!</p>\n\n<p>26:32 &ndash; Chuck: You are web famous!</p>\n\n<p>26:35 &ndash; Guest: I don&rsquo;t know about that, but I do have some things out there.</p>\n\n<p>26:42 &ndash; Chuck: How can people find you?</p>\n\n<p>26:49 &ndash; Guest: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanchenkie?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor\">Twitter!</a> <a href=\"https://ryanchenkie.com\">Website!</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/chenkie\">GitHub!</a></p>\n\n<p>27:18 &ndash; Chuck: Picks!</p>\n\n<p>27:25 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-fb&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;targetid=kwd-298507762065&amp;crid=285105591548&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw9ygzoDB3gIVD0sNCh2zHQSlEAAYAiAAEgIltfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Fresh Books!</a></p>\n\n<p>END &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">CacheFly</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Links: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://jquery.com\">jQuery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=javascript&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://vuejs.org\">Vue</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org\">React</a></li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s Twitter</li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chuck@devchat.tv\">chuck@devchat.tv</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com\">Code Academy</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://auth0.com\">Auth0</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://scotch.io\">Scotch.io</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-chenkie-a6665890\">Ryan&rsquo;s LinkedIn</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://ryanchenkie.com/securing-angular-applications/\">Ryan&rsquo;s Packages</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://ryanchenkie.com\">Ryan&rsquo;s Website</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanchenkie?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor\">Ryan&rsquo;s Twitter</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/chenkie\">Ryan&rsquo;s GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sponsors: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\">Get A Coder Job</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com\">Fresh Books</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">Cache Fly</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Picks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ryan</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://securityheaders.com\">Security Headers</a></li>\n    <li>Try to push past the fear of being an &ldquo;imposter&rdquo;!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Chuck</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></li>\n    <li>Take time with family!</li>\n    <li>Being handy around your home. <a href=\"https://www.lowes.com\">Lowes.</a></li>\n    <li>Surprise yourself and go beyond the imposter syndrome!</li>\n</ul>\n \n",

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Panel: Charles Max Wood\nGuest: Ryan Chenkie\nThis week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Ryan Chenkie (Canada). He is a developer who uses JavaScript with Angular and Node and he does screencasting at angularcasts.io. They talk about Ryan\u2019s background, his current projects, and getting over imposter syndrome! Check it out!\nIn particular, we dive pretty deep on: \n0:00 \u2013 Advertisement: Get A Coder Job!\n0:47 \u2013 Chuck: Today our guest is Ryan Chenkie!\n0:55 \u2013 Guest: Hello! I\u2019m excited!\n1:02 \u2013 Chuck: What are you doing now?\n1:10 \u2013 Guest: I spent 2.5 years at Auth0 and learned a ton there. I was doing some side work and then figured out I had to focus on one thing or the other. Now I have been a consultant fulltime and also teaching, too. AngularCast.io I teach there.\n1:56 \u2013 Chuck: Sounds like people are excited about GraphQL. I\u2019ve been there, too, and make a similar decision.\n2:19 \u2013 Guest: It was a hard decision b/c I liked all of my colleagues there. I always had the itch to be self-employed.\n2:42 \u2013 Chuck: You figure out of it\u2019s for you or not.\n2:51 \u2013 Guest: Yep! I am happy to be another year of it.\n3:00 \u2013 Chuck: I went free-lanced about a year ago b/c the decision was made for me.\n3:29 \u2013 Guest: I am grateful for it.\n3:40 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah, we talk about this a lot on one of my podcast platforms. If you can make a connection with people then you\u2019ll be god.\n4:07 \u2013 Guest: Yeah I had to figure out if I would have to focus on the marketing side of things or not. Right now the projects are coming to me \u2013 right to my front door, which is great! It\u2019s this ever-expanding web.\n4:55 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah where people tend to show-up. Let\u2019s talk about your story! How did you get into programming?\n5:30 \u2013 Guest: It was a little less typically at the time. I was fully self-taught. I went to school for a somewhat Geography degree. It got boring for me at some point. I had to do one programming course while in school and it was in Java. I was terrible at it and I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was doing. It didn\u2019t help that the instruction wasn\u2019t great. I was terrible I didn\u2019t understand a thing. I was scared that I was going to fail the course. I came out of there feeling like I didn\u2019t have the chops to be a programmer. I was doing Geomantic-stuff. I learned that the further you get into this programming stuff you would make better money \u2013 better job, etc. I was trying to put this map/graph into a website and it said that I had to learn Java. This time, though, the material was taught to me in these small increments. I got into it more and I was more attracted to the idea of programming.\n10:00 \u2013 Guest continues.\n10:32 \u2013 Guest: I was learning Angular and JavaScript better.\n10:35 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah it makes you think through it. You have to go deep.\n10:47 \u2013 Guest: I would make a sample packet. I would get to certain points and get to a point and I couldn\u2019t explain what I did. I would get to a roadblock and I couldn\u2019t explain it. I would be on this tangent for a while and have to figure this out. I was working with the government, at this time, but I thought: maybe I could try this programming thing for a while. Did you go to NG Vegas conference?\n12:20 \u2013 Chuck: Nope.\n12:25 \u2013 Guest: There is this conference in Las Vegas \u2013 I am going to go and hang out with people. At this conference I met some important people. This company posted that they needed someone and I thought: this is the job for me. I sent an email \u2013 went to an interview \u2013 and did an example. I got the job and freaked out because I wasn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d programmer. I wrote some content for them and it\u2019s been all good.\n14:07 \u2013 Chuck: Let me back-up real quickly. How did you find Angular?\n14:18 \u2013 Guest: It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the \u201cmoment\u201d I had found Angular. As I am learning through Code Academy I am reading articles and stuff. I heard about Angular.js and watched some online tutorials and watched all of the talks from the conference. I thought that I needed to learn it b/c it was pretty popular at the time. I knew how to write JavaScript, but made me clearly see with Angular.js app I had to back up and learn it.\n15:34 \u2013 Chuck: Yep!\n16:05 \u2013 The guest mentions Hacker News among other things. \n16:22 \u2013 Chuck: Angular and Electron is what we brought you on for \u2013 is that what you are doing?\n16:36 \u2013 Guest: The guest talks about his experiences with Angular and Electron.\n18:26 \u2013 Chuck: Let\u2019s backup some more \u2013 didn\u2019t sound like you worked with a lot of tech companies right?\n18:51 \u2013 Guest: Yep that was my only one.\n18:57 \u2013 Chuck: I hear a lot of complaints from people having this imposter syndrome. You only being in the industry for a short amount of time \u2013 how did you overcome the imposter syndrome?\n19:34 \u2013 Guest: Imposter syndrome has been an issue for me \u2013 I wasn\u2019t crippled \u2013 but it\u2019s debilitating. \u201cWho am I to teach on this subject?\u201d \u2013 but I think I\u2019ve made conscious efforts to ignore that and to use it as a little bit as fuel. I remember, man, of being scarred! I remember being terrified to see the online comments \u2013 b/c they are going to \u201cknow\u201d that I don\u2019t know what I am talking about. Funny thing is that I had a lot of positive comments. Little-by-little, those positive pieces of feedback were good for me. I thought: At least I am helping people (like I said, little-by-little!). I think there has been a part of a loop there. If you can look for that feedback it can help overcome imposter syndrome. The things of value are the things that scare you.\u00a0\n22:41 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah, I talk about this all the time to people. I have been self-employed for 8.5 years. I am not going to starve. If I had to, I could go and find a \u201cnormal\u201d job.\n23:20 \u2013 Guest: I agree. One piece of feedback that I got from a colleague is that she said: you are very resourceful! Knowing that it helped b/c it was a boost of confidence. If I had this capacity of being resourceful that helped me make my decision. It wasn\u2019t a good time in the sense that we just had a baby. If it went south then I could always go back and get a \u201cnormal\u201d job.\n24:43 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah we talk about that in Agile development \u2013 the further you go the more information you get.\n24:58 \u2013 Guest. Yep\n25:03 \u2013 Chuck: What are you doing now?\n25:07 \u2013 Guest: I\u2019ve had a few large clients these past few years. I have current projects going now one is with a museum.

I got into it more and I was more attracted to the idea of programming.</p>\n\n<p>10:00 &ndash; <em>Guest continues.</em></p>\n\n<p>10:32 &ndash; Guest: I was learning Angular and JavaScript better.</p>\n\n<p>10:35 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah it makes you think through it. You have to go deep.</p>\n\n<p>10:47 &ndash; Guest: I would make a sample packet. I would get to certain points and get to a point and I couldn&rsquo;t explain what I did. I would get to a roadblock and I couldn&rsquo;t explain it. I would be on this tangent for a while and have to figure this out. I was working with the government, at this time, but I thought: maybe I could try this programming thing for a while. Did you go to NG Vegas conference?</p>\n\n<p>12:20 &ndash; Chuck: Nope.</p>\n\n<p>12:25 &ndash; Guest: There is this conference in Las Vegas &ndash; I am going to go and hang out with people. At this conference I met some important people. This company posted that they needed someone and I thought: this is the job for me. I sent an email &ndash; went to an interview &ndash; and did an example. I got the job and freaked out because I wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;real&rdquo; programmer. I wrote some content for them and it&rsquo;s been all good.</p>\n\n<p>14:07 &ndash; Chuck: Let me back-up real quickly. How did you find Angular?</p>\n\n<p>14:18 &ndash; Guest: It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint the &ldquo;moment&rdquo; I had found Angular. As I am learning through Code Academy I am reading articles and stuff. I heard about Angular.js and watched some online tutorials and watched all of the talks from the conference. I thought that I needed to learn it b/c it was pretty popular at the time. I knew how to write JavaScript, but made me clearly see with Angular.js app I had to back up and learn it.</p>\n\n<p>15:34 &ndash; Chuck: Yep!</p>\n\n<p>16:05 &ndash; <em>The guest mentions Hacker News among other things. </em></p>\n\n<p>16:22 &ndash; Chuck: Angular and Electron is what we brought you on for &ndash; is that what you are doing?</p>\n\n<p>16:36 &ndash; Guest: The guest talks about his experiences with Angular and Electron.</p>\n\n<p>18:26 &ndash; Chuck: Let&rsquo;s backup some more &ndash; didn&rsquo;t sound like you worked with a lot of tech companies right?</p>\n\n<p>18:51 &ndash; Guest: Yep that was my only one.</p>\n\n<p>18:57 &ndash; Chuck: I hear a lot of complaints from people having this imposter syndrome. You only being in the industry for a short amount of time &ndash; how did you overcome the imposter syndrome?</p>\n\n<p>19:34 &ndash; Guest: Imposter syndrome has been an issue for me &ndash; I wasn&rsquo;t crippled &ndash; but it&rsquo;s debilitating. &ldquo;Who am I to teach on this subject?&rdquo; &ndash; but I think I&rsquo;ve made conscious efforts to ignore that and to use it as a little bit as fuel. I remember, man, of being scarred! I remember being terrified to see the online comments &ndash; b/c they are going to &ldquo;know&rdquo; that I don&rsquo;t know what I am talking about. Funny thing is that I had a lot of positive comments. Little-by-little, those positive pieces of feedback were good for me. I thought: At least I am helping people (like I said, little-by-little!). I think there has been a part of a loop there. If you can look for that feedback it can help overcome imposter syndrome. The things of value are the things that scare you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>22:41 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah, I talk about this all the time to people. I have been self-employed for 8.5 years. I am not going to starve. If I had to, I could go and find a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; job.</p>\n\n<p>23:20 &ndash; Guest: I agree. One piece of feedback that I got from a colleague is that she said: you are very resourceful! Knowing that it helped b/c it was a boost of confidence. If I had this capacity of being resourceful that helped me make my decision. It wasn&rsquo;t a good time in the sense that we just had a baby. If it went south then I could always go back and get a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; job.</p>\n\n<p>24:43 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah we talk about that in Agile development &ndash; the further you go the more information you get.</p>\n\n<p>24:58 &ndash; Guest. Yep</p>\n\n<p>25:03 &ndash; Chuck: What are you doing now?</p>\n\n<p>25:07 &ndash; Guest: I&rsquo;ve had a few large clients these past few years. I have current projects going now one is with a museum. I am speaking at a few conferences &ndash; one of them was in San Francisco and Prague. Now I am planning for next year and figuring out what my teaching and speaking plans will be. It looks like I am focusing on Graph QL content. Lots of Angular, too!</p>\n\n<p>26:32 &ndash; Chuck: You are web famous!</p>\n\n<p>26:35 &ndash; Guest: I don&rsquo;t know about that, but I do have some things out there.</p>\n\n<p>26:42 &ndash; Chuck: How can people find you?</p>\n\n<p>26:49 &ndash; Guest: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanchenkie?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor\">Twitter!</a> <a href=\"https://ryanchenkie.com\">Website!</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/chenkie\">GitHub!</a></p>\n\n<p>27:18 &ndash; Chuck: Picks!</p>\n\n<p>27:25 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-fb&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;targetid=kwd-298507762065&amp;crid=285105591548&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw9ygzoDB3gIVD0sNCh2zHQSlEAAYAiAAEgIltfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Fresh Books!</a></p>\n\n<p>END &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">CacheFly</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Links: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://jquery.com\">jQuery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=javascript&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://vuejs.org\">Vue</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org\">React</a></li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s Twitter</li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chuck@devchat.tv\">chuck@devchat.tv</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com\">Code Academy</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://auth0.com\">Auth0</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://scotch.io\">Scotch.io</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-chenkie-a6665890\">Ryan&rsquo;s LinkedIn</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://ryanchenkie.com/securing-angular-applications/\">Ryan&rsquo;s Packages</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://ryanchenkie.com\">Ryan&rsquo;s Website</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanchenkie?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor\">Ryan&rsquo;s Twitter</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/chenkie\">Ryan&rsquo;s GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sponsors: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\">Get A Coder Job</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com\">Fresh Books</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">Cache Fly</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Picks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ryan</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://securityheaders.com\">Security Headers</a></li>\n    <li>Try to push past the fear of being an &ldquo;imposter&rdquo;!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Chuck</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></li>\n    <li>Take time with family!</li>\n    <li>Being handy around your home. <a href=\"https://www.lowes.com\">Lowes.</a></li>\n    <li>Surprise yourself and go beyond the imposter syndrome!</li>\n</ul>\n      "

We had you on <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-125-api-powered-components-for-severless-applications-with-travis-tidwell/\">Episode 125.</a> A lot has changed huh? The nice thing, though, about these changes is that we seem to be tackling different problems.</p>\n\n<p>1:42 &ndash; <a href=\"https://github.com/travist\">Guest:</a> They are stabilizing on the same on the same design patterns. I think that&rsquo;s refreshing. Back in the day, everyone had their own way of doing it. It was difficult to find which one is the RIGHT one.</p>\n\n<p>2:05 &ndash; Chuck: Yes, I agree. Gives us your background, please!</p>\n\n<p>2:20 &ndash; Guest: I am still doing Form IO, and the co-founder and CTO of the company. My Angular Story is MY story on how the company evolved.</p>\n\n<p>3:05 &ndash; Chuck: How did you get into programming?</p>\n\n<p>3:09 &ndash; Guest: I am going to be 40-years old in May! I am getting up there. Everyone who I am talking to (in my age) it seems like we have the same story. We have this story of having that REALLY old computer. Parents bring home the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/us-en/?ar=1\">IBM</a> or the <a href=\"http://oldcomputers.net/c64.html\">Commodore 64</a> and that really is my story. At the time, the only thing you could learn with it was to program &ndash; there weren&rsquo;t any video games, etc. A book that I geeked-out about was: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/DOS-Dummies-Dan-Gookin/dp/0764503618\">&ldquo;DOS for Dummies.&rdquo;</a></p>\n\n<p><em>The guest talks about his senior year in college and how he came to fall in-love with programming. </em></p>\n\n<p>6:28 &ndash; Guest: After college, I got a job for working for a company that used <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/\">C++</a> code. People ask: How the heck did you get into Web? My background, too, was tap dancing and in the arts. Most people don&rsquo;t know that. I was giving these tap lessons to kids &ndash; and around that time YouTube was just for cat videos. At the time, I thought it would be great to teach these tap video lessons online. I found a CMS at the time that would help me with my teaching intent. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about\">Drupal</a> took me into the frontend libraries. PHP is a backend language, and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about\">Drupal</a> was based entirely on PHP. There was this huge paradigm-shift within my career. I really got into these tools not knowing that it would change my career.</p>\n\n<p>My open source has taken me to tutorial videos. Eventually, a light bulb went off and I found a solution that needed to be solved within Angular.</p>\n\n<p>12:21 &ndash; Guest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>12:28 &ndash; Chuck: I love the side hustle description: I saw a need out there and we solved it!</p>\n\n<p>12:40 &ndash; Guest: Side hustle is great to talk about. Open source is a bit of a struggle (at that time) it was really hard to maintain open source and providing for your family at the same time. Open source is hard b/c you work your butt off, but you aren&rsquo;t getting paid for it. It&rsquo;s really, really difficult. I&rsquo;ve had ups-and-downs actually with open source. You have to get innovative with it. I am really big on and supportive of people who are monetizing off of open source.</p>\n\n<p>14:58 &ndash; Chuck: Open source &ndash; for me &ndash; I got burned out in June. Sometimes you are putting in a lot of time and not seeing any benefit from it. You have all of these things and something changes, something is different &ndash; I can&rsquo;t take another night not seeing my kids.</p>\n\n<p>16:06 &ndash; Guest: You have this original motivation as an open source developer &ndash; and you build something rally cool. You share with the world, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize the tail of it. Come to realize it worked well for you &ndash; but not for everyone!</p>\n\n<p>It makes your stock price go out &ndash; contributing to open source &ndash; especially if you have a popular open source library. Most of the jobs I would apply to I would just give them my <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a> repertoire. People are figuring out ways they can support themselves and monetize. The ones that can figure that out don&rsquo;t burnout.</p>\n\n<p>19:44 &ndash; Chuck: <a href=\"https://github.com/hzoo\">Babel &ndash; Henry Zhu.</a> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/henryzhu\">(See his Patreon account.)</a></p>\n\n<p>20:08 &ndash; Guest: How does he do it?</p>\n\n<p>20:20 &ndash; Chuck: It&rsquo;s mostly contributions.</p>\n\n<p>20:35 &ndash; Guest: I see that you are on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com\">Patreon.</a> I urge people to go there and help support those open source people. It&rsquo;s such a great thing and it&rsquo;s becoming a trend.

I think that&rsquo;s refreshing. Back in the day, everyone had their own way of doing it. It was difficult to find which one is the RIGHT one.</p>\n\n<p>2:05 &ndash; Chuck: Yes, I agree. Gives us your background, please!</p>\n\n<p>2:20 &ndash; Guest: I am still doing Form IO, and the co-founder and CTO of the company. My Angular Story is MY story on how the company evolved.</p>\n\n<p>3:05 &ndash; Chuck: How did you get into programming?</p>\n\n<p>3:09 &ndash; Guest: I am going to be 40-years old in May! I am getting up there. Everyone who I am talking to (in my age) it seems like we have the same story. We have this story of having that REALLY old computer. Parents bring home the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/us-en/?ar=1\">IBM</a> or the <a href=\"http://oldcomputers.net/c64.html\">Commodore 64</a> and that really is my story. At the time, the only thing you could learn with it was to program &ndash; there weren&rsquo;t any video games, etc. A book that I geeked-out about was: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/DOS-Dummies-Dan-Gookin/dp/0764503618\">&ldquo;DOS for Dummies.&rdquo;</a></p>\n\n<p><em>The guest talks about his senior year in college and how he came to fall in-love with programming. </em></p>\n\n<p>6:28 &ndash; Guest: After college, I got a job for working for a company that used <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/\">C++</a> code. People ask: How the heck did you get into Web? My background, too, was tap dancing and in the arts. Most people don&rsquo;t know that. I was giving these tap lessons to kids &ndash; and around that time YouTube was just for cat videos. At the time, I thought it would be great to teach these tap video lessons online. I found a CMS at the time that would help me with my teaching intent. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about\">Drupal</a> took me into the frontend libraries. PHP is a backend language, and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about\">Drupal</a> was based entirely on PHP. There was this huge paradigm-shift within my career. I really got into these tools not knowing that it would change my career.</p>\n\n<p>My open source has taken me to tutorial videos. Eventually, a light bulb went off and I found a solution that needed to be solved within Angular.</p>\n\n<p>12:21 &ndash; Guest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>12:28 &ndash; Chuck: I love the side hustle description: I saw a need out there and we solved it!</p>\n\n<p>12:40 &ndash; Guest: Side hustle is great to talk about. Open source is a bit of a struggle (at that time) it was really hard to maintain open source and providing for your family at the same time. Open source is hard b/c you work your butt off, but you aren&rsquo;t getting paid for it. It&rsquo;s really, really difficult. I&rsquo;ve had ups-and-downs actually with open source. You have to get innovative with it. I am really big on and supportive of people who are monetizing off of open source.</p>\n\n<p>14:58 &ndash; Chuck: Open source &ndash; for me &ndash; I got burned out in June. Sometimes you are putting in a lot of time and not seeing any benefit from it. You have all of these things and something changes, something is different &ndash; I can&rsquo;t take another night not seeing my kids.</p>\n\n<p>16:06 &ndash; Guest: You have this original motivation as an open source developer &ndash; and you build something rally cool. You share with the world, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize the tail of it. Come to realize it worked well for you &ndash; but not for everyone!</p>\n\n<p>It makes your stock price go out &ndash; contributing to open source &ndash; especially if you have a popular open source library. Most of the jobs I would apply to I would just give them my <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a> repertoire. People are figuring out ways they can support themselves and monetize.

You share with the world, but a lot of people don\u2019t realize the tail of it. Come to realize it worked well for you \u2013 but not for everyone!\nIt makes your stock price go out \u2013 contributing to open source \u2013 especially if you have a popular open source library. Most of the jobs I would apply to I would just give them my GitHub repertoire. People are figuring out ways they can support themselves and monetize. The ones that can figure that out don\u2019t burnout.\n19:44 \u2013 Chuck: Babel \u2013 Henry Zhu. (See his Patreon account.)\n20:08 \u2013 Guest: How does he do it?\n20:20 \u2013 Chuck: It\u2019s mostly contributions.\n20:35 \u2013 Guest: I see that you are on Patreon. I urge people to go there and help support those open source people. It\u2019s such a great thing and it\u2019s becoming a trend. That\u2019s one thing that drew me away from Drupal b/c at the time it had this negative connotation of monetizing on your open source. The spirit of the open source is THAT. It gives support to open source folks in order to provide for their families.\n22:00 \u2013 Chuck: I talk a lot with Eric through CodeFund. It\u2019s important to know these options.\n22:24 \u2013 Guest: That is my road of open source and in creating IO.\n24:01 \u2013 Chuck: You are the CTO and not the CEO. How did you wind up and forming IO?\n24:15 \u2013 Guest: There were a lot of pain points. It all started with the prototype.\nThe guest talks about the background. Travis mentions FormBuilder among other things. \n30:00 \u2013 Chuck: What are you working on now?\n30:05 \u2013 Guest: The Vanilla Core Renderer! It doesn\u2019t care what framework it gets attached to.

Check it out!</p>\n\n<p><strong>In particular, we dive pretty deep on: </strong></p>\n\n<p>0:00 &ndash; Advertisement: <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\">Get A Coder Job!</a></p>\n\n<p>0:49 &ndash; Chuck: Welcome! We had you on <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-125-api-powered-components-for-severless-applications-with-travis-tidwell/\">Episode 125.</a> A lot has changed huh? The nice thing, though, about these changes is that we seem to be tackling different problems.</p>\n\n<p>1:42 &ndash; <a href=\"https://github.com/travist\">Guest:</a> They are stabilizing on the same on the same design patterns. I think that&rsquo;s refreshing. Back in the day, everyone had their own way of doing it. It was difficult to find which one is the RIGHT one.</p>\n\n<p>2:05 &ndash; Chuck: Yes, I agree. Gives us your background, please!</p>\n\n<p>2:20 &ndash; Guest: I am still doing Form IO, and the co-founder and CTO of the company. My Angular Story is MY story on how the company evolved.</p>\n\n<p>3:05 &ndash; Chuck: How did you get into programming?</p>\n\n<p>3:09 &ndash; Guest: I am going to be 40-years old in May! I am getting up there. Everyone who I am talking to (in my age) it seems like we have the same story. We have this story of having that REALLY old computer. Parents bring home the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/us-en/?ar=1\">IBM</a> or the <a href=\"http://oldcomputers.net/c64.html\">Commodore 64</a> and that really is my story. At the time, the only thing you could learn with it was to program &ndash; there weren&rsquo;t any video games, etc. A book that I geeked-out about was: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/DOS-Dummies-Dan-Gookin/dp/0764503618\">&ldquo;DOS for Dummies.&rdquo;</a></p>\n\n<p><em>The guest talks about his senior year in college and how he came to fall in-love with programming. </em></p>\n\n<p>6:28 &ndash; Guest: After college, I got a job for working for a company that used <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/\">C++</a> code. People ask: How the heck did you get into Web? My background, too, was tap dancing and in the arts. Most people don&rsquo;t know that. I was giving these tap lessons to kids &ndash; and around that time YouTube was just for cat videos. At the time, I thought it would be great to teach these tap video lessons online. I found a CMS at the time that would help me with my teaching intent. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about\">Drupal</a> took me into the frontend libraries. PHP is a backend language, and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about\">Drupal</a> was based entirely on PHP. There was this huge paradigm-shift within my career. I really got into these tools not knowing that it would change my career.</p>\n\n<p>My open source has taken me to tutorial videos. Eventually, a light bulb went off and I found a solution that needed to be solved within Angular.</p>\n\n<p>12:21 &ndash; Guest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>12:28 &ndash; Chuck: I love the side hustle description: I saw a need out there and we solved it!</p>\n\n<p>12:40 &ndash; Guest: Side hustle is great to talk about. Open source is a bit of a struggle (at that time) it was really hard to maintain open source and providing for your family at the same time. Open source is hard b/c you work your butt off, but you aren&rsquo;t getting paid for it. It&rsquo;s really, really difficult. I&rsquo;ve had ups-and-downs actually with open source. You have to get innovative with it. I am really big on and supportive of people who are monetizing off of open source.</p>\n\n<p>14:58 &ndash; Chuck: Open source &ndash; for me &ndash; I got burned out in June. Sometimes you are putting in a lot of time and not seeing any benefit from it. You have all of these things and something changes, something is different &ndash; I can&rsquo;t take another night not seeing my kids.</p>\n\n<p>16:06 &ndash; Guest: You have this original motivation as an open source developer &ndash; and you build something rally cool. You share with the world, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize the tail of it.

He combines deep technical expertise with whole-system thinking to help development teams worldwide achieve great things! Check out his complete biography here! Chuck and James talk about Agile development, James\u2019 background, and future projects!\nIn particular, we dive pretty deep on: \n0:00 \u2013 Advertisement: Get A Coder Job!\n0:48 \u2013 Chuck: Welcome! James was on a past episode, which was show 205! Give us an introduction, please!\n1:05 \u2013 James: I have been involved with the software industry since 1991. I have written a book and it\u2019s fairly evergreen.\n1:30 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah, I remember that\u2019s when the Agile development was getting really, really hot!\n2:09 \u2013 James: Yeah in the early 2000s there was this energy to do software really well, and it seems like it\u2019s turned into this bureaucracy. I find that to be depressing a tiny bit.\n2:50 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah, I agree.\n3:01 \u2013 James: Going back to a perspective where excellence is no longer the priority; excellence in your craft.\n3:31 \u2013 Chuck.\n3:34 \u2013 James: Yeah that was Bob Marten.\u00a0\nJames talks about the Agile movement.\n4:22 \u2013 Chuck: This show is a walk back throughout your story. Let\u2019s talk about HOW you got into this stuff.\n4:40 \u2013 James talks about his background.\n4:58 \u2013 Chuck talks about his Grandpa and his experience with technology when he was young.\n5:10 \u2013 James: ...it had a whopping 2K of memory! That\u2019s really how I got involved into programming. Later on I got a Trash 80 then an Apple 2, so I had programming in through my blood.\n6:01 \u2013 Chuck.\n6:08 \u2013 James talks about switching between computer and antenna, and his black and white T.V. He also talks about the electrical engineering program at the university. \n7:16 \u2013 Chuck: I studied ad received my computer science degree.\n7:28 \u2013 James.\n7:34 \u2013 Chuck: You have been in the industry since 2001 and you are a bit older than me.\n7:50 \u2013 James: My first job was in 1994. Then I wrote some things with Fido Net. Fido Net was this early online form thing. Sort of like Used Net / Used Groups (online bulletin web forms) via the telephone dial-up. They were hobbyists running this out from their home. It was basically chat forms.\nOnce you have some experience (doesn\u2019t matter your degree) \u2013 it\u2019s...have you done this before?\n9:30 \u2013 Chuck: This is RIGHT in-line with what I say in my eBook that I am developing now.\n10:00 \u2013 James: I didn\u2019t even post that I was looking for a job, but I got very lucky.\n10:15 \u2013 Chuck: What is your journey look like and how did you get into Agile development?\n10:30 \u2013 James talks about his Kickstarter, knowledge in JavaScript, programming experience, and more here \u2013 check it out!\n13:16 \u2013 Chuck: How did you get to Agile development?\n13:31 \u2013 James: I was programming throughout my teens. I was working on a really complicated project. I still play Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). It was the most complicated program that I built at that point. I had it in my head and then I didn\u2019t understand it anymore. The program collapsed. To me that was really transformative b/c it\u2019s not writing the algorithms but how it all works together. Then this taught me how to communicate the design to the other members on the team to make it work.\n15:50 \u2013 James: Have you heard of Rational Rose? You don\u2019t hear about it anymore b/c it was a complete flop.\n17:20 \u2013 Chuck: Wow!\n17:33 \u2013 James: It was actually detrimental to get it done. It really was a crisis of faith. I ran into this book: Object Modeling in Color by Peter Coad.\nExtreme Programming is mentioned, too, by James\u2019 coworker! \n21:10 \u2013 Chuck: It\u2019s so interesting to me. We focus so much on the technological side, we forget to talk about the people, and the other sides to this. It\u2019s easy to overlook this other stuff.\n21:47 \u2013 James: There is so much silver bullet thinking within this industry. The original communication from person-to-person is so crucial. It\u2019s so important to software development. Ultimately, the computer doesn\u2019t care, but the collaboration is the real trick and the real challenge.\n23:10 \u2013 Chuck talks about his brother and his computer science courses experience.\n24:27 \u2013 James: It could be that 1 team could solve a problem but nowadays it\u2019s working with multiple teams. People want to water things down to help facilitate \u2013 but don\u2019t do that. There is a huge large scale Agile that is large interdependent teams.\n25:19 \u2013 Chuck: MFCEO is a podcast that I am listening to now. He says that nobody wants to sit down and dictate what each member will be responsible for.\nChuck reads a quote from an episode from MFCEO \u2013 check it out!\n26:54 \u2013 James: It\u2019s something that people have lost track of. I still program daily even though I do this Agile stuff as well. I have been programming for 25 years and Extreme Programming was the most effective thing for me throughout my career.\nJames: I think XP is the time (now) to have a comeback!\n29:41 \u2013 Chuck: That was my experience, too. We pushed one team to go to Agile, and then we went to our boss.\nChuck: We\u2019d sit down every two weeks and have an Agile-Perspective (what is working and what isn\u2019t working). We are talking about HOW we are writing the software, and that is really what we are after.\n30:54 \u2013 James: You are building the TEAM that builds the project. Of course, you need to have consistencies across the team, and every team is different b/c every member has different personalities. Mod Programming is we are going to work as a whole group around a screen. Personally, that is not my style but I would TRY it. If it worked for that team then I would do it.\n32:00 \u2013 Chuck: That is the beauty of it. With this set of programmers x, y, and z may or may not work, and that is O.K.\n32:25 \u2013 James: I heard about Extreme Programming and I thought it was nuts!!\n32:40 \u2013 Chuck.\n32:44 \u2013 James: The more I tried it, and the more it worked. Try Extreme Programming b/c it\u2019s totally a different experience. It\u2019s my book that I wrote 10 years ago but it still is applicable today. Try it for a few months (3 months) or so, b/c it takes time to figure out the different terms and such. Go try out a bunch of new different things, but figuring out HOW to make it work for me.\n34:05 \u2013 Chuck: Yeah, you need data. Look at the data. Go experiment.\n34:47 \u2013 James: Try it for real. Check out this essay: \u201cWe tried baseball, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\nJames: Many things only work in context!\u00a0 What we do is we change the context in Agile.\n35:58 \u2013 Chuck: What are you working on now?\n36:00 \u2013 James: I am actually working on AgileFluency.org.

He also talks about the electrical engineering program at the university. </em></p>\n\n<p>7:16 &ndash; Chuck: I studied ad received my computer science degree.</p>\n\n<p>7:28 &ndash; James.</p>\n\n<p>7:34 &ndash; Chuck: You have been in the industry since 2001 and you are a bit older than me.</p>\n\n<p>7:50 &ndash; James: My first job was in 1994. Then I wrote some things with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet\">Fido Net</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet\">Fido Net</a> was this early online form thing. Sort of like Used Net / Used Groups (online bulletin web forms) via the telephone dial-up. They were hobbyists running this out from their home. It was basically chat forms.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have some experience (doesn&rsquo;t matter your degree) &ndash; it&rsquo;s...have you done this before?</p>\n\n<p>9:30 &ndash; Chuck: This is RIGHT in-line with what I say in my eBook that I am developing now.</p>\n\n<p>10:00 &ndash; James: I didn&rsquo;t even post that I was looking for a job, but I got very lucky.</p>\n\n<p>10:15 &ndash; Chuck: What is your journey look like and how did you get into Agile development?</p>\n\n<p>10:30 &ndash; <em>James talks about his Kickstarter, knowledge in JavaScript, programming experience, and more here &ndash; check it out!</em></p>\n\n<p>13:16 &ndash; Chuck: How did you get to<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\"> Agile</a> development?</p>\n\n<p>13:31 &ndash; James: I was programming throughout my teens. I was working on a really complicated project. I still play Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D). It was the most complicated program that I built at that point. I had it in my head and then I didn&rsquo;t understand it anymore. The program collapsed. To me that was really transformative b/c it&rsquo;s not writing the algorithms but how it all works together. Then this taught me how to communicate the design to the other members on the team to make it work.</p>\n\n<p>15:50 &ndash; James: Have you heard of <a href=\"https://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/Rational-Rose\">Rational Rose</a>? You don&rsquo;t hear about it anymore b/c it was a complete flop.</p>\n\n<p>17:20 &ndash; Chuck: Wow!</p>\n\n<p>17:33 &ndash; James: It was actually detrimental to get it done. It really was a crisis of faith. I ran into this book: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Modeling_in_Color\">Object Modeling in Color by Peter Coad.</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Extreme Programming is mentioned, too, by James&rsquo; coworker! </em></p>\n\n<p>21:10 &ndash; Chuck: It&rsquo;s so interesting to me. We focus so much on the technological side, we forget to talk about the people, and the other sides to this. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook this other stuff.</p>\n\n<p>21:47 &ndash; James: There is so much silver bullet thinking within this industry. The original communication from person-to-person is so crucial. It&rsquo;s so important to software development. Ultimately, the computer doesn&rsquo;t care, but the collaboration is the real trick and the real challenge.</p>\n\n<p>23:10 &ndash; <em>Chuck talks about his brother and his computer science courses experience.</em></p>\n\n<p>24:27 &ndash; James: It could be that 1 team could solve a problem but nowadays it&rsquo;s working with multiple teams. People want to water things down to help facilitate &ndash; but don&rsquo;t do that. There is a huge large scale Agile that is large interdependent teams.</p>\n\n<p>25:19 &ndash; Chuck: <a href=\"https://andyfrisella.com/blogs/mfceo-project-podcast\">MFCEO is a podcast</a> that I am listening to now. He says that nobody wants to sit down and dictate what each member will be responsible for.</p>\n\n<p><em>Chuck reads a quote from an episode from </em><a href=\"https://andyfrisella.com/blogs/mfceo-project-podcast\"><em>MFCEO</em></a><em> &ndash; check it out!</em></p>\n\n<p>26:54 &ndash; James: It&rsquo;s something that people have lost track of. I still program daily even though I do this Agile stuff as well. I have been programming for 25 years and Extreme Programming was the most effective thing for me throughout my career.</p>\n\n<p>James: I think XP is the time (now) to have a comeback!</p>\n\n<p>29:41 &ndash; Chuck: That was my experience, too. We pushed one team to go to Agile, and then we went to our boss.</p>\n\n<p>Chuck: We&rsquo;d sit down every two weeks and have an Agile-Perspective (what is working and what isn&rsquo;t working). We are talking about HOW we are writing the software, and that is really what we are after.</p>\n\n<p>30:54 &ndash; James: You are building the TEAM that builds the project. Of course, you need to have consistencies across the team, and every team is different b/c every member has different personalities. Mod Programming is we are going to work as a whole group around a screen. Personally, that is not my style but I would TRY it. If it worked for that team then I would do it.</p>\n\n<p>32:00 &ndash; Chuck: That is the beauty of it. With this set of programmers x, y, and z may or may not work, and that is O.K.</p>\n\n<p>32:25 &ndash; James: I heard about Extreme Programming and I thought it was nuts!!</p>\n\n<p>32:40 &ndash; Chuck.</p>\n\n<p>32:44 &ndash; James: The more I tried it, and the more it worked. Try Extreme Programming b/c it&rsquo;s totally a different experience. It&rsquo;s my<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-Pragmatic-Software-ebook/dp/B00F8QCK0E/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=1541462025\"> book</a> that I wrote 10 years ago but it still is applicable today. Try it for a few months (3 months) or so, b/c it takes time to figure out the different terms and such. Go try out a bunch of new different things, but figuring out HOW to make it work for me.</p>\n\n<p>34:05 &ndash; Chuck: Yeah, you need data. Look at the data. Go experiment.</p>\n\n<p>34:47 &ndash; James: Try it for real. Check out this essay: &ldquo;We tried baseball, and it didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>James: Many things only work in context!&nbsp; What we do is we change the context in Agile.</p>\n\n<p>35:58 &ndash; Chuck: What are you working on now?</p>\n\n<p>36:00 &ndash; James: I am actually working on AgileFluency.org. It&rsquo;s a set of tools for coaches and leaders to CHANGE their context. How can you find those constraints and invest on changing those.</p>\n\n<p>36:31 &ndash; Chuck: Where do they go to find you?</p>\n\n<p>36:40 &ndash; James: My website - it&rsquo;s the ugliest website, but it&rsquo;s been working since 2003.</p>\n\n<p>36:54 &ndash; Picks!</p>\n\n<p>37:05 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-fb&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;targetid=kwd-298507762065&amp;crid=285105591548&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw9ygzoDB3gIVD0sNCh2zHQSlEAAYAiAAEgIltfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Fresh Books!</a></p>\n\n<p>END &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">CacheFly</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Links: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://jquery.com\">jQuery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=javascript&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://vuejs.org\">Vue</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org\">React</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://slack.com/lp/two?cvosrc=ppc.google.d_ppc_google_us_en_brand-mv&amp;cvo_creative=256925706868&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=d_ppc_google_us_en_brand-mv&amp;utm_term=%252Bslack&amp;&amp;cvosrc=ppc.google.%252Bslack&amp;cvo_campaign=&amp;cvo_crid=256925706868&amp;Matchtype=b&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;c3api=5523,256925706868,%252Bslack&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs7626PLS3gIV0LXACh0POQj0EAAYASAAEgLN5_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Slack</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/zone.js?activeTab=readme\">Zone.js</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/angular/zone.js/\">GitHub &ndash; Zone.js</a></li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s Twitter</li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chuck@devchat.tv\">chuck@devchat.tv</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair\">Timex Sinclair</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet\">FidoNet</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL\">VHDL</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Java-Modeling-Color-UML-Enterprise/dp/013011510X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=devchattv-20&amp;linkId=9cbfdf19d899d5c1a4374f823fd9ef45&amp;language=en_US\">Book: Java Modeling Color with UML</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://pivotal.io/labs\">Pivotal Labs</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-Pragmatic-Software-ebook/dp/B00F8QCK0E/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=1541462025\">Book: The ART OF AGILE DEVELOPMENT BY JAMES SHORE</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.jamesshore.com\">James Shore&rsquo;s Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sponsors: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\"><strong>Get A Coder Job</strong></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com\">Fresh Books</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">Cache Fly</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Picks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Chuck</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://andyfrisella.com/blogs/mfceo-project-podcast\">Podcast: MFCEO</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>James</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Package Management Tool: <a href=\"https://nixos.org/nix/\">Nix.org</a></li>\n</ul>\n      "

I have been working <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/zone.js?activeTab=readme\">on Zone.js</a> for the past 2&frac12; years. I basically handle everything with <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/zone.js?activeTab=readme\">Zone.js</a>.

My first job, my classmate introduced me to a company that had 5 employees, which was a software company. About 15 years ago, back in China, they were using old software. The founder is using new technologies. So this is cool. That&rsquo;s how I entered into the development world.</p>\n\n<p>4:15 &ndash; <em>Chuck asks a question.</em></p>\n\n<p>4:22 &ndash; Jia: My focus, at the time, was the frontend.</p>\n\n<p>5:10 &ndash; Chuck: How did you get into Angular?</p>\n\n<p>5:12 &ndash; <a href=\"https://angular.io\"><em>Angular</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://reactjs.org\"><em>React</em></a><em>, and</em><a href=\"https://jquery.com\"><em> jQuery</em></a><em> are mentioned by Jia.</em></p>\n\n<p>6:20 &ndash; Jia: We did a big project for 1&frac12; years with a huge team of 500 people. We used...to build the applications.</p>\n\n<p>6:51 &ndash; Chuck: How was the transition from Angular to Angular 2?</p>\n\n<p>6:58 &ndash; Jia: At first the company had some reservations b/c everything is new.</p>\n\n<p><em>Jia talks about an architect of the company and the knowledge that he offered, at the time, to help. </em></p>\n\n<p>8:17 &ndash; Chuck: You have contributed to Zone.js. People think that they have to be a genius in order to contribute. How did you start contributing to it?</p>\n\n<p>8:44 &ndash; Jia: Between Angular 1 to Angular 2 was about a few months in-between.</p>\n\n<p><em>Jia continues to talk. </em></p>\n\n<p>9:28 &ndash; Jia: We get a request from the client and get a certain zone. Each request is managed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Jia talks about his contributions to Zone.js and how he offered his insights, in the beginning, during his spare time. </em></p>\n\n<p>12:12 &ndash; Chuck: This is a project that is used across thousands of Angular applications. And here we are talking about your journey to this open-source. You started off with a bug fix and this leads to helping with code, and finally you are one of the major contributors now! People think they cannot contribute to open-source b/c they aren&rsquo;t a &ldquo;genius.&rdquo; They think that they &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t that good.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>13:16 &ndash; Jia: I never thought I could do it &ndash; meaning contributing to open-source work. I thought you had to have very strong coding skills, but it&rsquo;s really just starting with the first step. True, you need to start with the code, but you don&rsquo;t have to have a very strong background. I didn&rsquo;t have (at the time) a strong JavaScript background, and look...I was able to do it! If you really love it &ndash; you can contribute to it.</p>\n\n<p>15:11 &ndash; Chuck: You fixed a bug b/c you were using it. There is a difference between people writing it vs. people who are using it. You were fixing a bug b/c you were actually using it. &ldquo;It should work this way under these circumstances.&rdquo; If you are using the library then you will find those bugs.</p>\n\n<p>16:35 &ndash; Jia: Yes, exactly. Some people are using Zone.js, but they don&rsquo;t know what it does.</p>\n\n<p>17:24 &ndash; Chuck: What are you currently working on now and/or what are you proud of?</p>\n\n<p>17:29 &ndash; Jia: I am still working on the Zone.js project. I just changed my job a few months ago. I am starting a startup company to help with technological solutions. I am working (right now) on frontend. It&rsquo;s very interesting to do some Cloud stuff.</p>\n\n<p>18:50 &ndash; Chuck: Where can we find you?</p>\n\n<p>18:55 &ndash; Jia.</p>\n\n<p>20:50 &ndash; Chuck: What social media platforms do you use?</p>\n\n<p>21:00 &ndash; Jia: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jialipassion?lang=en\">Twitter!</a> <a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com/@Jialipassion\">Blog!</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Jia talks about his current proposal that he is working on. </em></p>\n\n<p>24:20 &ndash; Chuck: Let&rsquo;s go to <strong>Picks!</strong></p>\n\n<p>24:26 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-fb&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;targetid=kwd-298507762065&amp;crid=285105591548&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw9ygzoDB3gIVD0sNCh2zHQSlEAAYAiAAEgIltfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Fresh Books!</a></p>\n\n<p>25:30 &ndash; Picks</p>\n\n<p>END &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">CacheFly</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Links: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://jquery.com\">jQuery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=javascript&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://vuejs.org\">Vue</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org\">React</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://slack.com/lp/two?cvosrc=ppc.google.d_ppc_google_us_en_brand-mv&amp;cvo_creative=256925706868&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=d_ppc_google_us_en_brand-mv&amp;utm_term=%252Bslack&amp;&amp;cvosrc=ppc.google.%252Bslack&amp;cvo_campaign=&amp;cvo_crid=256925706868&amp;Matchtype=b&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;c3api=5523,256925706868,%252Bslack&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs7626PLS3gIV0LXACh0POQj0EAAYASAAEgLN5_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Slack</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/zone.js?activeTab=readme\">Zone.js</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/angular/zone.js/\">GitHub &ndash; Zone.js</a></li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s Twitter</li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chuck@devchat.tv\">chuck@devchat.tv</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-210-zone-js-with-jia-li/\">AiA 210 &ndash; Past Episode with Jia Li</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jia-li-9146a222/\">Jia Li LinkedIn</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jialipassion?lang=en\">Jia Li Twitter</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com/@Jialipassion\">Jia Li Blog</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sponsors: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\"><strong>Get A Coder Job</strong></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com\">Fresh Books</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">Cache Fly</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Picks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Charles</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://andyfrisella.com/blogs/mfceo-project-podcast\">Podcast: MFCEO</a></li>\n    <li>Audible: <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/Extreme-Ownership-Audiobook/B015TVHUA2\">Extreme Ownership by Willink and Babin</a></li>\n    <li>Audible: <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Travelers-Gift-Audiobook/B002V1O4KI\">Traveler&rsquo;s Gift by by Andy Andrews</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Jia</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://slack.com/lp/two?cvosrc=ppc.google.d_ppc_google_us_en_brand-mv&amp;cvo_creative=256925706868&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=d_ppc_google_us_en_brand-mv&amp;utm_term=%252Bslack&amp;&amp;cvosrc=ppc.google.%252Bslack&amp;cvo_campaign=&amp;cvo_crid=256925706868&amp;Matchtype=b&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;c3api=5523,256925706868,%252Bslack&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs7626PLS3gIV0LXACh0POQj0EAAYASAAEgLN5_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Slack</a> group &ndash; posts on Angular &ndash; check them out!</li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com\">Angular In-Depth</a></li>\n</ul>\n \n",

That kind of makes me famous in the community.\n1:50 \u2013 Chuck: It\u2019s the library that...\n1:58 \u2013 Jia: Yes that is correct.\n2:19 \u2013 Chuck: Let\u2019s rollback a little bit and talk about your journey into programming?\n2:32 \u2013 Jia: My major is not Computer Science it\u2019s Communication. My first job, my classmate introduced me to a company that had 5 employees, which was a software company. About 15 years ago, back in China, they were using old software. The founder is using new technologies. So this is cool. That\u2019s how I entered into the development world.\n4:15 \u2013 Chuck asks a question.\n4:22 \u2013 Jia: My focus, at the time, was the frontend.\n5:10 \u2013 Chuck: How did you get into Angular?\n5:12 \u2013 Angular, React, and jQuery are mentioned by Jia.\n6:20 \u2013 Jia: We did a big project for 1\u00bd years with a huge team of 500 people. We used...to build the applications.\n6:51 \u2013 Chuck: How was the transition from Angular to Angular 2?\n6:58 \u2013 Jia: At first the company had some reservations b/c everything is new.\nJia talks about an architect of the company and the knowledge that he offered, at the time, to help. \n8:17 \u2013 Chuck: You have contributed to Zone.js. People think that they have to be a genius in order to contribute. How did you start contributing to it?\n8:44 \u2013 Jia: Between Angular 1 to Angular 2 was about a few months in-between.\nJia continues to talk. \n9:28 \u2013 Jia: We get a request from the client and get a certain zone. Each request is managed.\nJia talks about his contributions to Zone.js and how he offered his insights, in the beginning, during his spare time. \n12:12 \u2013 Chuck: This is a project that is used across thousands of Angular applications. And here we are talking about your journey to this open-source. You started off with a bug fix and this leads to helping with code, and finally you are one of the major contributors now! People think they cannot contribute to open-source b/c they aren\u2019t a \u201cgenius.\u201d They think that they \u201caren\u2019t that good.\u201d\n13:16 \u2013 Jia: I never thought I could do it \u2013 meaning contributing to open-source work. I thought you had to have very strong coding skills, but it\u2019s really just starting with the first step. True, you need to start with the code, but you don\u2019t have to have a very strong background. I didn\u2019t have (at the time) a strong JavaScript background, and look...I was able to do it! If you really love it \u2013 you can contribute to it.\n15:11 \u2013 Chuck: You fixed a bug b/c you were using it. There is a difference between people writing it vs. people who are using it. You were fixing a bug b/c you were actually using it. \u201cIt should work this way under these circumstances.\u201d If you are using the library then you will find those bugs.\n16:35 \u2013 Jia: Yes, exactly. Some people are using Zone.js, but they don\u2019t know what it does.\n17:24 \u2013 Chuck: What are you currently working on now and/or what are you proud of?\n17:29 \u2013 Jia: I am still working on the Zone.js project. I just changed my job a few months ago. I am starting a startup company to help with technological solutions. I am working (right now) on frontend. It\u2019s very interesting to do some Cloud stuff.\n18:50 \u2013 Chuck: Where can we find you?\n18:55 \u2013 Jia.\n20:50 \u2013 Chuck: What social media platforms do you use?\n21:00 \u2013 Jia: Twitter!

I have focused on frontend development and right now it&rsquo;s Angular and before it was Angular.js and others. I have been developing C# and started off with PHP. So I really enjoy frontend development the most.</p>\n\n<p>1:58 &ndash; Chuck: I am talking with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EisenbergEffect?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor\">Rob Eisenberg</a> in a few days.</p>\n\n<p>2:04 &ndash; Guest: From what I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s a great guy. He worked on the Angular router. He branched out to Greater Zone.</p>\n\n<p>2:28 &ndash; Chuck.</p>\n\n<p>2:38 &ndash; Guest.</p>\n\n<p>2:45 &ndash; Chuck: His episode will come out in 2 weeks! Tell us about you &ndash; what got you into programming?</p>\n\n<p>3:00 &ndash; Guest: It started when I was 5 years old. My brother and I broke 3-4 computers before they bought us a Nintendo set. That was my first dive into it. Then I went to PCs and back in 1999 I wrote my first website with Notepad. Then later I decided to make a career out of it and studied in college. Then started developing full-stack.</p>\n\n<p>4:53 &ndash; Chuck: You mentioned Knockout, Angular.js, and others. What have systems have you built in the backend?</p>\n\n<p>5:03 &ndash; Guest: Yes, PHP in the beginning. Then I moved onto...</p>\n\n<p><em>(Guest continues answer Chuck&rsquo;s question.)</em></p>\n\n<p>6:30 &ndash; Chuck: What was about Angular that you liked? Why did you choose that framework?</p>\n\n<p>6:47 &ndash; Guest: I got to choose the frontend framework (at the job I was at), and I chose NOT to use Angular. At the time, I thought it was confusing and overwhelming. Ember was stronger for me back then. But then later I got the opportunity to work with it in my current job, and now I am enjoying it. It&rsquo;s always a challenge.</p>\n\n<p>8:48 &ndash; Chuck: Seeing that transition and like that. I am curious though &ndash; what features do Angular have that Knockout and others don&rsquo;t have for you?</p>\n\n<p>9:08 &ndash; Guest: We used Coffee Script back then. Do you know it?</p>\n\n<p>9:36 &ndash; Chuck: Yep I know it.</p>\n\n<p>9:45 &ndash; Guest: I remember studying typescript, too.</p>\n\n<p>Coffee Script removed a lot of the stupid errors.</p>\n\n<p>11:22 &ndash; Chuck: I think typescript is the way to go.</p>\n\n<p>11:57 &ndash; Guest: It helps with those stupid errors that people make once in a while. It&rsquo;s a type language.</p>\n\n<p>12:45 &ndash; (<em>Guest continues.</em>)</p>\n\n<p>13:14 &ndash; Chuck: Making the transition from Angular to Angular.js &ndash; what process did you go through?</p>\n\n<p>13:25 &ndash; (<em>Guest answers. He talks about starting from scratch to learn the new Angular.</em>)</p>\n\n<p>14:08 &ndash; Guest: I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go back to Angular.js. There is so much to learn about Angular and working in-depth with it, there are still new things to explore every day, it&rsquo;s a large framework. I guess that&rsquo;s part of the reason why people use React and other frameworks b/c it can be overwhelming, especially for beginners.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoy it now b/c I read it now as a native tongue / native language. That&rsquo;s what I see now, but that&rsquo;s not what you see at first b/c there are so many new syntaxes. React is mostly JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>17:22 &ndash; Chuck: What features do you like about Angular <em>over</em> Angular.js?</p>\n\n<p>17:28 &ndash; Guest: It&rsquo;s the performance &ndash; it&rsquo;s important!</p>\n\n<p>18:20 &ndash; Chuck: What have you done in Angular that you are proud of?</p>\n\n<p>18:24 &ndash; Guest: I am working on a few articles and I am about to release 2 of them. It&rsquo;s a whole series.</p>\n\n<p>I am going to <a href=\"https://gotocph.com\">Copenhagen</a> soon and I will be giving a talk.</p>\n\n<p>20:17 &ndash; Cuck: What else are you working on?</p>\n\n<p>20:23 &ndash; Guest: Yes, the articles. I am finishing those up. There will be 4-5 more in the series on that one topic. I want to focus on one topic at a time. There are 3 main concepts: container components, presentation components, and migration.</p>\n\n<p>Yes improving my talk for next month&rsquo;s conference. I am building a small app, too. Working with new technologies and learning about offline apps and install the apps natively on most platforms now. We aren&rsquo;t dependent on official App Store now, that&rsquo;s a thing of the past now.</p>\n\n<p>22:06 &ndash; Chuck: Where can people find you online?</p>\n\n<p>22:16 &ndash; Guest: I have a few projects through GitHub. Find me there. (See links below.) Read my articles when they are published on Medium.</p>\n\n<p>22:44 &ndash; Chuck.</p>\n\n<p>22:48 &ndash; Guest: My first published articles will be at <a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com/@LayZeeDK\">Angular In Depth.</a></p>\n\n<p>23:00 &ndash; Chuck: Picks!</p>\n\n<p>23:04 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-na-fb&amp;camp=US%2528SEM%2529Branded%257CEXM&amp;ag=%255Bfreshbooks%255D&amp;kw=freshbooks&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;kwid=kwd-298507762065&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;crid=285105591548&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhIm0z8uu3gIVk7fACh1niQUNEAAYASAAEgKeq_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Fresh Books!</a></p>\n\n<p>27:13 &ndash; Chuck: What is the tech scene like in Denmark?</p>\n\n<p>27:18 &ndash; Guest: You have to keep up the pace yourself b/c I live in a very small area. There are only a few cities in Denmark where the jobs are. I will go to Meetups and conferences and I am active on European Slack. That&rsquo;s how I get to be social in the Angular community. I am mostly working at home. I have twin daughters who are 7 years old. I am mostly at the office, too, building and working there, which is 5 miles away from my home.</p>\n\n<p>29:17 &ndash; Chuck: In the past episode I talked with someone from Bulgaria, it sounds similar to what you are saying Lars. I am curious are people willing to hire remote if they are outside of the city?</p>\n\n<p>29:40 &ndash; Guest: It depends on the company.</p>\n\n<p>30:25 &ndash; Chuck: Working remotely is definitely a skill.</p>\n\n<p>30:44 &ndash; Guest: I have worked remotely for some jobs b/c I was driving several hours a day.</p>\n\n<p>31:21 &ndash; Chuck: My longest commute was 30 minutes top, but I live in a heavy tech scene where I live. Do most people in Denmark know English?</p>\n\n<p>31:5- Guest: My daughters have been speaking English since 3-4 years old b/c of iPads. They are also taught English and German in the school, too.</p>\n\n<p>32:21 &ndash; Chuck: Anything else? Are there things that people don&rsquo;t think about being a developer in Denmark?</p>\n\n<p>32:40 &ndash; Guest: There aren&rsquo;t that many big companies. It&rsquo;s difficult to get into the right place. There are small companies in Denmark.</p>\n\n<p>33:51 &ndash; Chuck: Does that change the way people find jobs in Denmark?</p>\n\n<p>33:59 &ndash; Guest: If you don&rsquo;t like to work for a bank then you have a problem b/c that&rsquo;s half the jobs! If you don&rsquo;t like certain industries that could make it harder to get a job as a programmer.</p>\n\n<p>34:33 &ndash; Chuck: I am going to wrap this up &ndash; anything else?</p>\n\n<p>34:44 &ndash; Guest: Create a blog post or start an open source project. That&rsquo;s what I do when I get bored. When you teach a subject you have to be an expert to be able to explain it to someone else.</p>\n\n<p>35:37 &ndash; (<em>Guest lists the titles of his articles &ndash; check it out at this timestamp!)</em></p>\n\n<p>35:50 &ndash; <em>(Chuck discusses future episodes and future guests that he will interview.)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Links: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://jquery.com\">jQuery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=javascript&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://vuejs.org\">Vue</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/\">C#</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com\">Angular In Depth</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com/model-view-presenter-with-angular-3a4dbffe49bb\">Article about Model-View-Presenter with Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-reactive-javascript\">Mastering Reactive JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/router\">Angular Router</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@LayZeeDK\">Lars&rsquo; Medium</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/LayZeeDK\">Lars&rsquo; GitHub</a></li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s Twitter</li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chuck@devchat.tv\">chuck@devchat.tv</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sponsors: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\"><strong>Get A Coder Job</strong></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com\">Fresh Books</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">Cache Fly</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Picks:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Charles</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/?&amp;OCID=AID736750_SEM_T09nVtr6\">Azure DevOps</a> &ndash; It&rsquo;s free for up to 5-6 team members!</li>\n    <li>Chat System: <a href=\"https://mattermost.com\">Mattermost</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Lars</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com\">Angular In Depth</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-reactive-javascript\">Book: Mastering Reactive JavaScript by Erich de Souza Oliveira</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/router\">Angular Router Book</a></li>\n</ul>\n \n",

Check out today\u2019s episode to hear more!\u00a0\nIn particular, we dive pretty deep on: \n0:53 \u2013 Guest: Hello from Denmark!\n1:00 \u2013 Chuck: My great, great, great grandmother is Danish. Introduce yourself, please.\n1:20 \u2013 Guest: I have been working through various companies through my career. I have focused on frontend development and right now it\u2019s Angular and before it was Angular.js and others. I have been developing C# and started off with PHP.

Tell us about you \u2013 what got you into programming?\n3:00 \u2013 Guest: It started when I was 5 years old. My brother and I broke 3-4 computers before they bought us a Nintendo set. That was my first dive into it. Then I went to PCs and back in 1999 I wrote my first website with Notepad. Then later I decided to make a career out of it and studied in college. Then started developing full-stack.\n4:53 \u2013 Chuck: You mentioned Knockout, Angular.js, and others. What have systems have you built in the backend?\n5:03 \u2013 Guest: Yes, PHP in the beginning.

He has worked with many different frameworks, but he and Chuck talk in detail about Angular. Finally, they discuss Lars&rsquo; programming background and the current projects he is working on. Check out today&rsquo;s episode to hear more!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>In particular, we dive pretty deep on: </strong></p>\n\n<p>0:53 &ndash; Guest: Hello from Denmark!</p>\n\n<p>1:00 &ndash; Chuck: My great, great, great grandmother is Danish. Introduce yourself, please.</p>\n\n<p>1:20 &ndash; Guest: I have been working through various companies through my career. I have focused on frontend development and right now it&rsquo;s Angular and before it was Angular.js and others. I have been developing C# and started off with PHP. So I really enjoy frontend development the most.</p>\n\n<p>1:58 &ndash; Chuck: I am talking with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EisenbergEffect?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor\">Rob Eisenberg</a> in a few days.</p>\n\n<p>2:04 &ndash; Guest: From what I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s a great guy. He worked on the Angular router. He branched out to Greater Zone.</p>\n\n<p>2:28 &ndash; Chuck.</p>\n\n<p>2:38 &ndash; Guest.</p>\n\n<p>2:45 &ndash; Chuck: His episode will come out in 2 weeks! Tell us about you &ndash; what got you into programming?</p>\n\n<p>3:00 &ndash; Guest: It started when I was 5 years old. My brother and I broke 3-4 computers before they bought us a Nintendo set. That was my first dive into it. Then I went to PCs and back in 1999 I wrote my first website with Notepad. Then later I decided to make a career out of it and studied in college. Then started developing full-stack.</p>\n\n<p>4:53 &ndash; Chuck: You mentioned Knockout, Angular.js, and others. What have systems have you built in the backend?</p>\n\n<p>5:03 &ndash; Guest: Yes, PHP in the beginning. Then I moved onto...</p>\n\n<p><em>(Guest continues answer Chuck&rsquo;s question.)</em></p>\n\n<p>6:30 &ndash; Chuck: What was about Angular that you liked? Why did you choose that framework?</p>\n\n<p>6:47 &ndash; Guest: I got to choose the frontend framework (at the job I was at), and I chose NOT to use Angular. At the time, I thought it was confusing and overwhelming. Ember was stronger for me back then. But then later I got the opportunity to work with it in my current job, and now I am enjoying it. It&rsquo;s always a challenge.</p>\n\n<p>8:48 &ndash; Chuck: Seeing that transition and like that. I am curious though &ndash; what features do Angular have that Knockout and others don&rsquo;t have for you?</p>\n\n<p>9:08 &ndash; Guest: We used Coffee Script back then. Do you know it?</p>\n\n<p>9:36 &ndash; Chuck: Yep I know it.</p>\n\n<p>9:45 &ndash; Guest: I remember studying typescript, too.</p>\n\n<p>Coffee Script removed a lot of the stupid errors.</p>\n\n<p>11:22 &ndash; Chuck: I think typescript is the way to go.</p>\n\n<p>11:57 &ndash; Guest: It helps with those stupid errors that people make once in a while. It&rsquo;s a type language.</p>\n\n<p>12:45 &ndash; (<em>Guest continues.</em>)</p>\n\n<p>13:14 &ndash; Chuck: Making the transition from Angular to Angular.js &ndash; what process did you go through?</p>\n\n<p>13:25 &ndash; (<em>Guest answers. He talks about starting from scratch to learn the new Angular.</em>)</p>\n\n<p>14:08 &ndash; Guest: I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go back to Angular.js. There is so much to learn about Angular and working in-depth with it, there are still new things to explore every day, it&rsquo;s a large framework. I guess that&rsquo;s part of the reason why people use React and other frameworks b/c it can be overwhelming, especially for beginners.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoy it now b/c I read it now as a native tongue / native language. That&rsquo;s what I see now, but that&rsquo;s not what you see at first b/c there are so many new syntaxes. React is mostly JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>17:22 &ndash; Chuck: What features do you like about Angular <em>over</em> Angular.js?</p>\n\n<p>17:28 &ndash; Guest: It&rsquo;s the performance &ndash; it&rsquo;s important!</p>\n\n<p>18:20 &ndash; Chuck: What have you done in Angular that you are proud of?</p>\n\n<p>18:24 &ndash; Guest: I am working on a few articles and I am about to release 2 of them. It&rsquo;s a whole series.</p>\n\n<p>I am going to <a href=\"https://gotocph.com\">Copenhagen</a> soon and I will be giving a talk.</p>\n\n<p>20:17 &ndash; Cuck: What else are you working on?</p>\n\n<p>20:23 &ndash; Guest: Yes, the articles. I am finishing those up. There will be 4-5 more in the series on that one topic. I want to focus on one topic at a time. There are 3 main concepts: container components, presentation components, and migration.</p>\n\n<p>Yes improving my talk for next month&rsquo;s conference. I am building a small app, too. Working with new technologies and learning about offline apps and install the apps natively on most platforms now. We aren&rsquo;t dependent on official App Store now, that&rsquo;s a thing of the past now.</p>\n\n<p>22:06 &ndash; Chuck: Where can people find you online?</p>\n\n<p>22:16 &ndash; Guest: I have a few projects through GitHub. Find me there. (See links below.) Read my articles when they are published on Medium.</p>\n\n<p>22:44 &ndash; Chuck.</p>\n\n<p>22:48 &ndash; Guest: My first published articles will be at <a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com/@LayZeeDK\">Angular In Depth.</a></p>\n\n<p>23:00 &ndash; Chuck: Picks!</p>\n\n<p>23:04 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-na-fb&amp;camp=US%2528SEM%2529Branded%257CEXM&amp;ag=%255Bfreshbooks%255D&amp;kw=freshbooks&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;kwid=kwd-298507762065&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;crid=285105591548&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhIm0z8uu3gIVk7fACh1niQUNEAAYASAAEgKeq_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Fresh Books!</a></p>\n\n<p>27:13 &ndash; Chuck: What is the tech scene like in Denmark?</p>\n\n<p>27:18 &ndash; Guest: You have to keep up the pace yourself b/c I live in a very small area. There are only a few cities in Denmark where the jobs are. I will go to Meetups and conferences and I am active on European Slack. That&rsquo;s how I get to be social in the Angular community. I am mostly working at home. I have twin daughters who are 7 years old. I am mostly at the office, too, building and working there, which is 5 miles away from my home.</p>\n\n<p>29:17 &ndash; Chuck: In the past episode I talked with someone from Bulgaria, it sounds similar to what you are saying Lars. I am curious are people willing to hire remote if they are outside of the city?</p>\n\n<p>29:40 &ndash; Guest: It depends on the company.</p>\n\n<p>30:25 &ndash; Chuck: Working remotely is definitely a skill.</p>\n\n<p>30:44 &ndash; Guest: I have worked remotely for some jobs b/c I was driving several hours a day.</p>\n\n<p>31:21 &ndash; Chuck: My longest commute was 30 minutes top, but I live in a heavy tech scene where I live. Do most people in Denmark know English?</p>\n\n<p>31:5- Guest: My daughters have been speaking English since 3-4 years old b/c of iPads. They are also taught English and German in the school, too.</p>\n\n<p>32:21 &ndash; Chuck: Anything else? Are there things that people don&rsquo;t think about being a developer in Denmark?</p>\n\n<p>32:40 &ndash; Guest: There aren&rsquo;t that many big companies. It&rsquo;s difficult to get into the right place. There are small companies in Denmark.</p>\n\n<p>33:51 &ndash; Chuck: Does that change the way people find jobs in Denmark?</p>\n\n<p>33:59 &ndash; Guest: If you don&rsquo;t like to work for a bank then you have a problem b/c that&rsquo;s half the jobs! If you don&rsquo;t like certain industries that could make it harder to get a job as a programmer.</p>\n\n<p>34:33 &ndash; Chuck: I am going to wrap this up &ndash; anything else?</p>\n\n<p>34:44 &ndash; Guest: Create a blog post or start an open source project. That&rsquo;s what I do when I get bored. When you teach a subject you have to be an expert to be able to explain it to someone else.</p>\n\n<p>35:37 &ndash; (<em>Guest lists the titles of his articles &ndash; check it out at this timestamp!)</em></p>\n\n<p>35:50 &ndash; <em>(Chuck discusses future episodes and future guests that he will interview.)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Links: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://jquery.com\">jQuery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=javascript&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://vuejs.org\">Vue</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/\">C#</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com\">Angular In Depth</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com/model-view-presenter-with-angular-3a4dbffe49bb\">Article about Model-View-Presenter with Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-reactive-javascript\">Mastering Reactive JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/router\">Angular Router</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@LayZeeDK\">Lars&rsquo; Medium</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/LayZeeDK\">Lars&rsquo; GitHub</a></li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s Twitter</li>\n    <li>Chuck&rsquo;s E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chuck@devchat.tv\">chuck@devchat.tv</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sponsors: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\"><strong>Get A Coder Job</strong></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com\">Fresh Books</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">Cache Fly</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Picks:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Charles</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/?&amp;OCID=AID736750_SEM_T09nVtr6\">Azure DevOps</a> &ndash; It&rsquo;s free for up to 5-6 team members!</li>\n    <li>Chat System: <a href=\"https://mattermost.com\">Mattermost</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Lars</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://blog.angularindepth.com\">Angular In Depth</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-reactive-javascript\">Book: Mastering Reactive JavaScript by Erich de Souza Oliveira</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/router\">Angular Router Book</a></li>\n</ul>\n      "

Chuck and Georgi talk about his background, past and current projects, and so much more!\nIn particular, we dive pretty deep on: \n0:15 \u2013 Advertisement: Get A Coder Job!\n0:49 \u2013 Chuck: Hello!\n0:53 \u2013 Georgi: Hi!\n1:00 \u2013 Chuck: Introduce yourself, please!\n1:08 \u2013 Georgi: I have been an Angular developer and love it every step of the way.\n1:20 \u2013 Chuck: I stared talking to past guests of Angular, and I find that \u00bd the people are in the U.S. and the other places, too. Different places but what is your experience as being a developer in the other parts of the world are similar.\n2:12 \u2013 Georgi: I got into programming but I didn\u2019t want to be at a desk all day. I had some friends in the software industry and I liked what they had. In Bulgaria the people in the software industry they have a 2x or 3x standard of living. I really wanted to begin to try to get into software engineering. I didn\u2019t have any technical background. I went to some interviews and I saw that I needed a lot of knowledge to gain. I learned about the Telerik Academy is doing. They have a large academy and that year I learned a lot and I jumped to this opportunity b/c it seemed like magic. Someone is going to teach me how to be a developer and not charge me? I got into it and it was fun, challenging, and rewarding for me. I dropped my current gig and I went to being a developer.\n5:14 \u2013 How long is the program at the Telerik Academy.\n5:20 \u2013 Georgi: It\u2019s about a year. Evenings and then you need to go fulltime.\n5:45 \u2013 Do they teach you JavaScript?\n5:50 \u2013 Georgi: Yes. Also, DotNet. Java was mentioned in 2011.\n6:17 \u2013 Kendo UI have widgets for DotNet.\n6:28 \u2013 Georgi.\n6:35 \u2013 Chuck: What got you into JavaScript?\n6:44 \u2013 Georgi: The previous job I had they used Angular. At that time I was doing...which is a service site rendered HTML. We were using some jQuery and Knock Out, I was learning about Angular and was interested. It was an Angular job and it was technically interesting. They talked about 3D rendering. At least that\u2019s what I got from the conversation. Doing the job we got a few new hires, and they started a project in Angular. We learned from each other, and inspired by people like YOU, and from the Angular talks at conferences. I was inspired.\n8:21 \u2013 You get into Java and Angular did you get into API?\n8:31 \u2013 Georgi: Yes.\n8:38 \u2013 I like how Microsoft names stuff.\n8:47 \u2013 Georgi: I am listening to...if you have a cool project alias then the project name becomes WCF or something long and tedious.\n9:09 \u2013 I love those guys.\n9:15 \u2013 Georgi: I am listening to them b/c someone recommended them. They put the bar really high with their mood and content.\n9:40 \u2013 Chuck: Carl owns a production company. They do a great job.\n9:52 \u2013 Chuck: What was it about Angular that got you excited?\n10:05 \u2013 Georgi: It\u2019s similar to the backend stuff and people get into Angular g/c it\u2019s similar to NVC. I got a lot of the documentation b/c it\u2019s written well. At that time my daughter was 6 months old and I was reading her the Angular documentation. I really enjoyed that. Angular was brand new at that point and I didn\u2019t have a mentor at that time. The learning experience was great, and the flow was fun for me b/c it was challenging.\n11:33 \u2013 Chuck: The experience is good.\n11:42 \u2013 How did you get your first programming job?\n11:45 \u2013 Georgi: Basically out of the academy \u2013 2 months out. The people believed in me and I am thankful. I was only 28 years old and I wasn\u2019t the normal person.\n12:22 \u2013 I got my first job at 27.\n12:30 \u2013 A lot of people are transitioning. I did an episode with Tina from South Africa. She moved to England and then to the U.S. She has a Ph.D. in Physics and she transitioned into programming in her 50\u2019s. People think: I am \u201cold\u201d, and it really doesn\u2019t matter.\n13:27 \u2013 Georgi: People complain while they are sitting down on their butts. I want people to know that you can do it. No matter your age or your experience. The coding knowledge will give you a lot of freedom in the future, because it\u2019s doing magic. Everyone should learn how to code as a hobby in addition to your normal job.\n14:55 \u2013 Chuck: It might be things like AI and how we interact on our devices. It will be a life skill what we consider to be mundane jobs at this point.\n15:18 \u2013 Georgi: People say AI could take my job, but also AI will create jobs.\n15:36 \u2013 Chuck: People theorize about this. Every time people advance in technology it does create more jobs. I worry about the psychology of here is money as a handout.\n16:29 \u2013 Georgi: We get our self-respect b/c of what we accomplish in the job. Most of us work 8 hours with these certain people and these problems. It\u2019s good to like and even love what you do.\n17:00 \u2013 Chuck: What have you done with Angular that you are proud of?\n17:05 \u2013 Georgi: Learning from scratch and learning the basics; eventually advancing my knowledge. Lately I have been going to Meetups and do a presentation there. The theme was...\nI wanted to contribute back to Angular, and my computer at home is PC. I had troubles with...\nI am an Angular contributor and I am proud of that. I am not a docker nor was I expert angular person, but here I am.\n20:25 \u2013 Chuck: That\u2019s what peoples mindsets are: I am not this___, I am not that____, etc. If you want a job and you are 90 years old \u2013 got for it. You don\u2019t have to be a genius, but you can find something to contribute to the community.\n21:17 \u2013 Georgi: We have a lot of Angular from my work, I wanted to give back some. Also, and make a name for myself. Again, it was fun and challenging and nice to do it.\n21:44 \u2013 Chuck: Now that doesn\u2019t hurt b/c you can put on your CV.\n21:55 \u2013 Georgi: It only shows the top 100. I am not there, but oh well.\n22:09 \u2013 Chuck: Every little piece helps. You know, it\u2019s a good way to get involved and so much more. What are you working on now?\n22:28 \u2013 Georgi: The project I am working on is not using Angular. Besides that I am doing a video course on functional C# and it\u2019s a work in progress.\n23:10 \u2013 Chuck: Anywhere people can find your course?\n23:15 \u2013 Georgi: It\u2019s less than 50% done, so no.\n23:30 \u2013 Chuck: What\u2019s it like being a developer in Bulgaria?\n23:35 \u2013 Georgi: Bulgaria, has a higher living standard for the software industry.\n24:55 \u2013 Chuck: Is most of the documentation for computers out there in English in Bulgaria?\n24:58 \u2013 Georgi: No, not the general population speaks English. It does make it a tad harder to transition if you don\u2019t know English. But some of the academies do\n25:50 \u2013 Chuck: I was a missionary for LDDS in Italy and so my experience as the younger generation speaks English but not the older generation.\n26:39 - Georgi: English is 2nd language in Amsterdam.\n27:11 \u2013 (Chuck talks about international community and developers.)\n27:38 \u2013 Our team was \u00bd and \u00bd out here in Bulgaria. We did meetings in English most of the time.\n28:07 \u2013 Chuck: Are you located in Sofia?\nGeorgi: Yes.\n28:15 \u2013 Chuck: When you get outside of the city is there a programming community?\n28:20 \u2013 Georgi: Yes, definitely. Again, though, it does change. When they graduate from the Telerik Academy...\n29:27 \u2013 Chuck: I live in Utah and we are between NV and WY and CO. There is an area (North of Salt Lake City) that has a healthy tech scene. It depends on where you are in UT for a strong/weak teach center.\n30:31 \u2013 Georgi: I would think the younger kids would like to do it and they need to do it here in the bigger cities. That is not unusual.\n31:00 \u2013 Chuck: Yes, people pick up the skills and get hired and then they go and work remotely.

Chuck and Georgi talk about his background, past and current projects, and so much more!</p>\n\n<p><strong>In particular, we dive pretty deep on: </strong></p>\n\n<p>0:15 &ndash; Advertisement: Get A Coder Job!</p>\n\n<p>0:49 &ndash; Chuck: Hello!</p>\n\n<p>0:53 &ndash; Georgi: Hi!</p>\n\n<p>1:00 &ndash; Chuck: Introduce yourself, please!</p>\n\n<p>1:08 &ndash; Georgi: I have been an Angular developer and love it every step of the way.</p>\n\n<p>1:20 &ndash; Chuck: I stared talking to past guests of Angular, and I find that &frac12; the people are in the U.S. and the other places, too. Different places but what is your experience as being a developer in the other parts of the world are similar.</p>\n\n<p>2:12 &ndash; Georgi: I got into programming but I didn&rsquo;t want to be at a desk all day. I had some friends in the software industry and I liked what they had. In Bulgaria the people in the software industry they have a 2x or 3x standard of living. I really wanted to begin to try to get into software engineering. I didn&rsquo;t have any technical background. I went to some interviews and I saw that I needed a lot of knowledge to gain. I learned about the <a href=\"https://www.telerikacademy.com\">Telerik Academy</a> is doing. They have a large academy and that year I learned a lot and I jumped to this opportunity b/c it seemed like magic. Someone is going to teach me how to be a developer and not charge me? I got into it and it was fun, challenging, and rewarding for me. I dropped my current gig and I went to being a developer.</p>\n\n<p>5:14 &ndash; How long is the program at the Telerik Academy.</p>\n\n<p>5:20 &ndash; Georgi: It&rsquo;s about a year. Evenings and then you need to go fulltime.</p>\n\n<p>5:45 &ndash; Do they teach you JavaScript?</p>\n\n<p>5:50 &ndash; Georgi: Yes. Also, DotNet. Java was mentioned in 2011.</p>\n\n<p>6:17 &ndash; Kendo UI have widgets for DotNet.</p>\n\n<p>6:28 &ndash; Georgi.</p>\n\n<p>6:35 &ndash; Chuck: What got you into JavaScript?</p>\n\n<p>6:44 &ndash; Georgi: The previous job I had they used Angular. At that time I was doing...which is a service site rendered HTML. We were using some jQuery and Knock Out, I was learning about Angular and was interested. It was an Angular job and it was technically interesting. They talked about 3D rendering. At least that&rsquo;s what I got from the conversation. Doing the job we got a few new hires, and they started a project in Angular. We learned from each other, and inspired by people like YOU, and from the Angular talks at conferences. I was inspired.</p>\n\n<p>8:21 &ndash; You get into Java and Angular did you get into API?</p>\n\n<p>8:31 &ndash; Georgi: Yes.</p>\n\n<p>8:38 &ndash; I like how Microsoft names stuff.</p>\n\n<p>8:47 &ndash; Georgi: I am listening to...if you have a cool project alias then the project name becomes WCF or something long and tedious.</p>\n\n<p>9:09 &ndash; I love those guys.</p>\n\n<p>9:15 &ndash; Georgi: I am listening to them b/c someone recommended them. They put the bar really high with their mood and content.</p>\n\n<p>9:40 &ndash; Chuck: Carl owns a production company. They do a great job.</p>\n\n<p>9:52 &ndash; Chuck: What was it about Angular that got you excited?</p>\n\n<p>10:05 &ndash; Georgi: It&rsquo;s similar to the backend stuff and people get into Angular g/c it&rsquo;s similar to NVC. I got a lot of the documentation b/c it&rsquo;s written well. At that time my daughter was 6 months old and I was reading her the Angular documentation. I really enjoyed that. Angular was brand new at that point and I didn&rsquo;t have a mentor at that time. The learning experience was great, and the flow was fun for me b/c it was challenging.</p>\n\n<p>11:33 &ndash; Chuck: The experience is good.</p>\n\n<p>11:42 &ndash; How did you get your first programming job?</p>\n\n<p>11:45 &ndash; Georgi: Basically out of the academy &ndash; 2 months out. The people believed in me and I am thankful. I was only 28 years old and I wasn&rsquo;t the normal person.</p>\n\n<p>12:22 &ndash; I got my first job at 27.</p>\n\n<p>12:30 &ndash; A lot of people are transitioning. I did an episode with Tina from South Africa. She moved to England and then to the U.S. She has a Ph.D. in Physics and she transitioned into programming in her 50&rsquo;s. People think: I am &ldquo;old&rdquo;, and it really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>\n\n<p>13:27 &ndash; Georgi: People complain while they are sitting down on their butts. I want people to know that you can do it. No matter your age or your experience. The coding knowledge will give you a lot of freedom in the future, because it&rsquo;s doing magic. Everyone should learn how to code as a hobby in addition to your normal job.</p>\n\n<p>14:55 &ndash; Chuck: It might be things like AI and how we interact on our devices. It will be a life skill what we consider to be mundane jobs at this point.</p>\n\n<p>15:18 &ndash; Georgi: People say AI could take my job, but also AI will create jobs.</p>\n\n<p>15:36 &ndash; Chuck: People theorize about this. Every time people advance in technology it does create more jobs. I worry about the psychology of here is money as a handout.</p>\n\n<p>16:29 &ndash; Georgi: We get our self-respect b/c of what we accomplish in the job. Most of us work 8 hours with these certain people and these problems. It&rsquo;s good to like and even love what you do.</p>\n\n<p>17:00 &ndash; Chuck: What have you done with Angular that you are proud of?</p>\n\n<p>17:05 &ndash; Georgi: Learning from scratch and learning the basics; eventually advancing my knowledge. Lately I have been going to Meetups and do a presentation there. The theme was...</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to contribute back to Angular, and my computer at home is PC. I had troubles with...</p>\n\n<p>I am an Angular contributor and I am proud of that. I am not a docker nor was I expert angular person, but here I am.</p>\n\n<p>20:25 &ndash; Chuck: That&rsquo;s what peoples mindsets are: I am not this___, I am not that____, etc. If you want a job and you are 90 years old &ndash; got for it. You don&rsquo;t have to be a genius, but you can find something to contribute to the community.</p>\n\n<p>21:17 &ndash; Georgi: We have a lot of Angular from my work, I wanted to give back some. Also, and make a name for myself. Again, it was fun and challenging and nice to do it.</p>\n\n<p>21:44 &ndash; Chuck: Now that doesn&rsquo;t hurt b/c you can put on your CV.</p>\n\n<p>21:55 &ndash; Georgi: It only shows the top 100. I am not there, but oh well.</p>\n\n<p>22:09 &ndash; Chuck: Every little piece helps. You know, it&rsquo;s a good way to get involved and so much more. What are you working on now?</p>\n\n<p>22:28 &ndash; Georgi: The project I am working on is not using Angular. Besides that I am doing a video course on functional C# and it&rsquo;s a work in progress.</p>\n\n<p>23:10 &ndash; Chuck: Anywhere people can find your course?</p>\n\n<p>23:15 &ndash; Georgi: It&rsquo;s less than 50% done, so no.</p>\n\n<p>23:30 &ndash; Chuck: What&rsquo;s it like being a developer in Bulgaria?</p>\n\n<p>23:35 &ndash; Georgi: Bulgaria, has a higher living standard for the software industry.</p>\n\n<p>24:55 &ndash; Chuck: Is most of the documentation for computers out there in English in Bulgaria?</p>\n\n<p>24:58 &ndash; Georgi: No, not the general population speaks English. It does make it a tad harder to transition if you don&rsquo;t know English. But some of the academies do</p>\n\n<p>25:50 &ndash; Chuck: I was a missionary for LDDS in Italy and so my experience as the younger generation speaks English but not the older generation.</p>\n\n<p>26:39 - Georgi: English is 2<sup>nd</sup> language in Amsterdam.</p>\n\n<p>27:11 &ndash; <em>(Chuck talks about international community and developers.)</em></p>\n\n<p>27:38 &ndash; Our team was &frac12; and &frac12; out here in Bulgaria. We did meetings in English most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>28:07 &ndash; Chuck: Are you located in Sofia?</p>\n\n<p>Georgi: Yes.</p>\n\n<p>28:15 &ndash; Chuck: When you get outside of the city is there a programming community?</p>\n\n<p>28:20 &ndash; Georgi: Yes, definitely. Again, though, it does change. When they graduate from the Telerik Academy...</p>\n\n<p>29:27 &ndash; Chuck: I live in Utah and we are between NV and WY and CO. There is an area (North of Salt Lake City) that has a healthy tech scene. It depends on where you are in UT for a strong/weak teach center.</p>\n\n<p>30:31 &ndash; Georgi: I would think the younger kids would like to do it and they need to do it here in the bigger cities. That is not unusual.</p>\n\n<p>31:00 &ndash; Chuck: Yes, people pick up the skills and get hired and then they go and work remotely. Do you have a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gparlakov\">Medium account?</a></p>\n\n<p>31:20 - Georgi: Yes, through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gparlakov\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gparlakov\">Medium.</a></p>\n\n<p>32:20 &ndash; Picks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Links: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://jquery.com\">jQuery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=javascript&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://vuejs.org\">Vue</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/\">C#</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgi-parlakov-09301962/?originalSubdomain=bg\">Georgi&rsquo;s LinkedIn</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@gparlakov\">Georgi&rsquo;s Medium</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@gparlakov/hello-great-article-1a40415e442c\">Georgi&rsquo;s Medium Article</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gparlakov\">Georgi&rsquo;s Twitter</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/gparlakov\">Georgi&rsquo;s GitHub</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5488846/georgi-parlakov\">Georgi&rsquo;s Stack Overflow</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://gparlakov.wordpress.com/home/\">Georgi&rsquo;s Blog</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sponsors: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\"><strong>Get A Coder Job</strong></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com\">Fresh Books</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">Cache Fly</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Picks:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Georgi</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Find your thing and take a leap of faith &ndash; it&rsquo;s never too late.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://angular.io/api/platform-browser/BrowserModule\">Angular BrowserModule</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032\">Book: The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0143118757/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540334516&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=getting+to+yes\">Book: Getting to Yes by Roger Fisher</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Charles</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Diabetes-Code-Prevent-Reverse-Naturally/dp/1771642653\">The Diabetes Code by Dr. Jason Fung</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.audible.com/ep/freetrial?source_code=GO1GBSH09091690EF&amp;device=d&amp;ds_rl=1262685&amp;ds_rl=1257028&amp;cvosrc=ppc.google.audible&amp;cvo_campaign=226473129&amp;cvo_crid=302405741403&amp;Matchtype=e&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6LSn6tGd3gIVFNNkCh0-bwKGEAAYASAAEgLhbPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Audible</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ultramarathon-Man-Confessions-All-Night-Runner/dp/1585424803/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540334427&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=ultramarathon+man\">Book: Ultramarathon Man by Dean Karnazes</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://2ketodudes.com\">2 Keto Dudes</a></li>\n    <li>Walk or Run a 5K everyday (3.1 miles)</li>\n</ul>\n      "

Today, they talk about Rob&rsquo;s past and current projects among other things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In particular, we dive pretty deep on: </strong></p>\n\n<p>1:40 &ndash; Chuck: Our special guest is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EisenbergEffect?lang=en\">Rob Eisenberg</a>. We&rsquo;ve had you on Adventures on Angular (<a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/009-aia-ng-2-0-with-rob-eisenberg/\">09</a> and <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/080-aia-aurelia-with-rob-eisenberg/\">80</a>), JavaScript Jabber, and others like <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/203-jsj-aurelia-with-rob-eisenberg/\">Episode 203.</a></p>\n\n<p>2:36 &ndash; Rob: That was over the period of 4 years all of those podcasts. I am getting older.</p>\n\n<p>2:50 &ndash; Chuck: Anything that you&rsquo;ve done that you want to talk about?</p>\n\n<p>3:04 &ndash; Rob: I am known for opensource work over the years. Maybe we can talk about my progression through that over the years.</p>\n\n<p>3:25 &ndash; Chuck: How did you get into this field?</p>\n\n<p>3:29 &ndash; Rob: When I was 8 years old my dad wanted to buy a computer. We went to Sears and we bought our first computer. You&rsquo;d buy the disk drive and the keyboard looking unit. You could by a monitor, we didn&rsquo;t, but we used a black and white TV for our monitor. Later we bought the colored monitor and printer. That&rsquo;s where my fascination started. We set up the computer in my bedroom. We played games. I got intrigued that you could write code to make different games.</p>\n\n<p>It was just magical for me. As being an adult engineer I am trying to go back to that moment to recapture that magical moment for me. It was a great creative outlet. That&rsquo;s how I first started. I started learning about Q basic and other flavors of Basic. Then I heard about C! I remember you could do anything with C. I went to the library and there wasn&rsquo;t the Internet, yet. There were 3 books about C and read it and re-read it. I didn&rsquo;t have any connections nor a compiler. When I first learned C I didn&rsquo;t have a compiler. I learned how to learn the codes on notebook paper, but as a kid this is what I first started doing. I actually saved some of this stuff and I have it lying around somewhere. I was big into adventure games. That&rsquo;s when I moved on <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++</a> and printed out my source code! It&rsquo;s so crazy to talk about it but at the time that&rsquo;s what I did as a kid. In JHS there was one other kid that geeked-out about it with me. It was a ton of fun.</p>\n\n<p>Then it was an intense hobby of mine. Then at the end of HS I had 2 loves: computers and percussion. I was composing for music, too. I had to decide between music or coding. I decided to go with music. It was the best decision I ever made because I studied music composition. When you are composing for dozens of instruments to play one unified thing. Every pitch, every rhythm, and it all works together. Why this note and why that rhythm? There is an artistic side to this and academia, too. The end result is that music is enjoyed by humans; same for software.</p>\n\n<p>I did 2 degrees in music and then started my Master&rsquo;s in Music. I then realized I love computers, too, how can I put these two together? I read some things on audio programming, and it stepped me back into programming. At this time, I was working in music education and trying to compose music for gamming. Someone said look at this program called <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/\">C#!</a> I don&rsquo;t know cause...how can you get any better than <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++?!</a></p>\n\n<p>In 2003 &ndash; I saw a book: teach yourself <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/\">C#</a> in 24 hours. I read it and I was enthralled with how neat this was! I was building some Windows applications through C#. I thought it was crazy that there was so much change from when I was in college.</p>\n\n<p>17:00 &ndash; Chuck: You start making this transition to web? What roped you in?</p>\n\n<p>17:25 &ndash; Rob: I realized the power of this, not completely roped in just, yet. Microsoft was working (around this time) with...</p>\n\n<p>19:45 &ndash; (Continued from Rob): When Silver Light died that&rsquo;s when I looked at the web. I said forget this native platform. I came back to JavaScript for the 2<sup>nd</sup> time &ndash; and said I am going to learn this language with the same intensity as I learned C++ and <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/\">C#.</a> I started working with Durandal.</p>\n\n<p>21:45 &ndash; Charles: Yeah, I remember when you worked with the router and stuff like that. You were on the core team.</p>\n\n<p>21:53 &ndash; Rob: The work I did on that was inspired by screen activation patterns.</p>\n\n<p>23:41 &ndash; Rob (continued): I work with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com\">InVision</a> now.</p>\n\n<p>24:14 &ndash; Charles: I remember you were on the Angular team and then you transitioned &ndash; what was that like?</p>\n\n<p>24:33 &ndash; Rob comments.</p>\n\n<p>25:28 &ndash; Rob (continued): I have been doing opensource for about 13 years. I almost burned myself a few times and almost went bankrupt a few times. The question is how to be involved, but run the race without getting burned-out. It&rsquo;s a marathon not a sprint.</p>\n\n<p>These libraries are huge assets. Thank God I didn&rsquo;t go bankrupt but became very close.</p>\n\n<p>The more popular something if there are more varieties and people not everyone is so pleasant. It&rsquo;s okay to disagree. Now what are the different opinions and what works well for your team and project? It&rsquo;s important to stay to your core and vision. Why would you pick THIS over THAT?</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a fun and exciting time if you are</p>\n\n<p>28:41 &ndash; Charles: What are you</p>\n\n<p>28:47 &ndash; Rob: InVision and InVision studio. It&rsquo;s a tool for designing screens. I work on that during the day and during the night I work on Aurelia.</p>\n\n<p>30:43 &ndash; Chuck: I am pretty sure that we have had people from InVision on a show before.</p>\n\n<p>31:03 &ndash; Rob comments.</p>\n\n<p>Rob: How we all work together.</p>\n\n<p>31:20 &ndash; What is coming in with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AureliaEffect\">Aurelia</a> next?</p>\n\n<p>31:24 &ndash; Rob: We are trying to work with as much backwards compatibility as we can. So you don&rsquo;t see a lot of the framework code in your app code. It&rsquo;s less intrusive. We are trying next, can we keep the same language, the same levels, and such but change the implementation under the hood. You don&rsquo;t learn anything new. You don&rsquo;t have new things to learn. But how it&rsquo;s implemented it&rsquo;s smaller, faster, and more efficient. We have made the framework more pluggable to the compiler-level. It&rsquo;s fully supported and super accessible.</p>\n\n<p>Frameworks will come and go &ndash; this is my belief is that you invest in the standards of the web. We are taking that up a notch. Unobtrusiveness is the next thing we want to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve always had great performance and now taking it to the next level. We are doing a lot around documentation. To help people understand what the architectural decisions are and why? We are taking it to the next level from our core. It&rsquo;s coming along swimmingly so I am really excited. We&rsquo;ve already got 90% test coverage and over 40,000 tests.</p>\n\n<p>37:33 &ndash; Chuck: Let&rsquo;s get you on JavaScript Jabber!</p>\n\n<p>38:19 &ndash; Chuck: Where can people find you?</p>\n\n<p>38:22 &ndash; Twitter, and everywhere else. <a href=\"https://aurelia.io/blog/\">Blog!</a></p>\n\n<p>39:17 &ndash; Chuck: Picks?</p>\n\n<p>39:23 &ndash; Rob dives in!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Links: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://jquery.com\">jQuery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=javascript&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://vuejs.org\">Vue</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/\">C#</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com\">InVision</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AureliaEffect\">Aurelia</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://aurelia.io/blog/\">Aurelia Blog by Rob</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eisenbergeffect?lang=en\">Rob Eisenberg&rsquo;s Twitter</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://robeisenberg.com\">Rob&rsquo;s Website</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robeisenberg\">Rob&rsquo;s LinkedIn</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/EisenbergEffect\">Rob&rsquo;s GitHub</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/009-aia-ng-2-0-with-rob-eisenberg/\">Rob&rsquo;s Episode 9</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/080-aia-aurelia-with-rob-eisenberg/\">Rob&rsquo;s Episode 80</a></li>\n    <li>Rob&rsquo;s Episode 203</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sponsors: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\"><strong>Get A Coder Job</strong></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com\">Fresh Books</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">Cache Fly</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Picks:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db\">Database: Orbit DB</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/203215/robit-riddle-storybook-adventures\">Robit Riddle</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://wingfeathersaga.com\">The Wingfeather Saga</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Charles</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Used to play: <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com\">Dungeons and Dragons</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.crafty-games.com/shop/little-wizards/\">Little Wizards</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.parkcity.org\">Park City, UT</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.vrbo.com/?k_clickid=EAIaIQobChMIgarx5M6L3gIVh7rACh3XtAdsEAAYAiAAEgKcHfD_BwE&amp;ds_kids=p26840931628&amp;ds_kid=43700026840931628&amp;ksprof_id=700000001561967&amp;ksdevice=c&amp;ktarget=kwd-304548565435&amp;kloct=&amp;klocf=9027224&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgarx5M6L3gIVh7rACh3XtAdsEAAYAiAAEgKcHfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">VRBO</a></li>\n</ul>\n \n",

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Panel: Charles Max Wood\nGuest: Rob Eisenberg\nThis week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Rob Eisenberg who is a principal software engineer at InVision, and is the creator of Caliburn.Micro, Durandal, and Aurelia. Today, they talk about Rob\u2019s past and current projects among other things.\nIn particular, we dive pretty deep on: \n1:40 \u2013 Chuck: Our special guest is Rob Eisenberg. We\u2019ve had you on Adventures on Angular (09 and 80), JavaScript Jabber, and others like Episode 203.\n2:36 \u2013 Rob: That was over the period of 4 years all of those podcasts. I am getting older.\n2:50 \u2013 Chuck: Anything that you\u2019ve done that you want to talk about?\n3:04 \u2013 Rob: I am known for opensource work over the years. Maybe we can talk about my progression through that over the years.\n3:25 \u2013 Chuck: How did you get into this field?\n3:29 \u2013 Rob: When I was 8 years old my dad wanted to buy a computer. We went to Sears and we bought our first computer. You\u2019d buy the disk drive and the keyboard looking unit. You could by a monitor, we didn\u2019t, but we used a black and white TV for our monitor. Later we bought the colored monitor and printer. That\u2019s where my fascination started. We set up the computer in my bedroom. We played games. I got intrigued that you could write code to make different games.\nIt was just magical for me. As being an adult engineer I am trying to go back to that moment to recapture that magical moment for me. It was a great creative outlet. That\u2019s how I first started. I started learning about Q basic and other flavors of Basic. Then I heard about C! I remember you could do anything with C. I went to the library and there wasn\u2019t the Internet, yet. There were 3 books about C and read it and re-read it. I didn\u2019t have any connections nor a compiler. When I first learned C I didn\u2019t have a compiler. I learned how to learn the codes on notebook paper, but as a kid this is what I first started doing. I actually saved some of this stuff and I have it lying around somewhere. I was big into adventure games. That\u2019s when I moved on C++ and printed out my source code! It\u2019s so crazy to talk about it but at the time that\u2019s what I did as a kid. In JHS there was one other kid that geeked-out about it with me. It was a ton of fun.\nThen it was an intense hobby of mine. Then at the end of HS I had 2 loves: computers and percussion. I was composing for music, too. I had to decide between music or coding. I decided to go with music. It was the best decision I ever made because I studied music composition. When you are composing for dozens of instruments to play one unified thing. Every pitch, every rhythm, and it all works together. Why this note and why that rhythm? There is an artistic side to this and academia, too. The end result is that music is enjoyed by humans; same for software.\nI did 2 degrees in music and then started my Master\u2019s in Music. I then realized I love computers, too, how can I put these two together? I read some things on audio programming, and it stepped me back into programming. At this time, I was working in music education and trying to compose music for gamming. Someone said look at this program called C#! I don\u2019t know cause...how can you get any better than C++?!\nIn 2003 \u2013 I saw a book: teach yourself C# in 24 hours. I read it and I was enthralled with how neat this was! I was building some Windows applications through C#. I thought it was crazy that there was so much change from when I was in college.\n17:00 \u2013 Chuck: You start making this transition to web? What roped you in?\n17:25 \u2013 Rob: I realized the power of this, not completely roped in just, yet. Microsoft was working (around this time) with...\n19:45 \u2013 (Continued from Rob): When Silver Light died that\u2019s when I looked at the web. I said forget this native platform. I came back to JavaScript for the 2nd time \u2013 and said I am going to learn this language with the same intensity as I learned C++ and C#. I started working with Durandal.\n21:45 \u2013 Charles: Yeah, I remember when you worked with the router and stuff like that. You were on the core team.\n21:53 \u2013 Rob: The work I did on that was inspired by screen activation patterns.\n23:41 \u2013 Rob (continued): I work with InVision now.\n24:14 \u2013 Charles: I remember you were on the Angular team and then you transitioned \u2013 what was that like?\n24:33 \u2013 Rob comments.\n25:28 \u2013 Rob (continued): I have been doing opensource for about 13 years. I almost burned myself a few times and almost went bankrupt a few times. The question is how to be involved, but run the race without getting burned-out. It\u2019s a marathon not a sprint.\nThese libraries are huge assets. Thank God I didn\u2019t go bankrupt but became very close.\nThe more popular something if there are more varieties and people not everyone is so pleasant. It\u2019s okay to disagree. Now what are the different opinions and what works well for your team and project? It\u2019s important to stay to your core and vision. Why would you pick THIS over THAT?\nIt\u2019s a fun and exciting time if you are\n28:41 \u2013 Charles: What are you\n28:47 \u2013 Rob: InVision and InVision studio. It\u2019s a tool for designing screens. I work on that during the day and during the night I work on Aurelia.\n30:43 \u2013 Chuck: I am pretty sure that we have had people from InVision on a show before.\n31:03 \u2013 Rob comments.\nRob: How we all work together.\n31:20 \u2013 What is coming in with Aurelia next?\n31:24 \u2013 Rob: We are trying to work with as much backwards compatibility as we can. So you don\u2019t see a lot of the framework code in your app code. It\u2019s less intrusive. We are trying next, can we keep the same language, the same levels, and such but change the implementation under the hood. You don\u2019t learn anything new. You don\u2019t have new things to learn. But how it\u2019s implemented it\u2019s smaller, faster, and more efficient. We have made the framework more pluggable to the compiler-level. It\u2019s fully supported and super accessible.\nFrameworks will come and go \u2013 this is my belief is that you invest in the standards of the web. We are taking that up a notch. Unobtrusiveness is the next thing we want to do.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve always had great performance and now taking it to the next level. We are doing a lot around documentation. To help people understand what the architectural decisions are and why? We are taking it to the next level from our core. It\u2019s coming along swimmingly so I am really excited. We\u2019ve already got 90% test coverage and over 40,000 tests.\n37:33 \u2013 Chuck: Let\u2019s get you on JavaScript Jabber!\n38:19 \u2013 Chuck: Where can people find you?\n38:22 \u2013 Twitter, and everywhere else.

You were on the core team.</p>\n\n<p>21:53 &ndash; Rob: The work I did on that was inspired by screen activation patterns.</p>\n\n<p>23:41 &ndash; Rob (continued): I work with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com\">InVision</a> now.</p>\n\n<p>24:14 &ndash; Charles: I remember you were on the Angular team and then you transitioned &ndash; what was that like?</p>\n\n<p>24:33 &ndash; Rob comments.</p>\n\n<p>25:28 &ndash; Rob (continued): I have been doing opensource for about 13 years. I almost burned myself a few times and almost went bankrupt a few times. The question is how to be involved, but run the race without getting burned-out. It&rsquo;s a marathon not a sprint.</p>\n\n<p>These libraries are huge assets. Thank God I didn&rsquo;t go bankrupt but became very close.</p>\n\n<p>The more popular something if there are more varieties and people not everyone is so pleasant. It&rsquo;s okay to disagree. Now what are the different opinions and what works well for your team and project? It&rsquo;s important to stay to your core and vision. Why would you pick THIS over THAT?</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a fun and exciting time if you are</p>\n\n<p>28:41 &ndash; Charles: What are you</p>\n\n<p>28:47 &ndash; Rob: InVision and InVision studio. It&rsquo;s a tool for designing screens. I work on that during the day and during the night I work on Aurelia.</p>\n\n<p>30:43 &ndash; Chuck: I am pretty sure that we have had people from InVision on a show before.</p>\n\n<p>31:03 &ndash; Rob comments.</p>\n\n<p>Rob: How we all work together.</p>\n\n<p>31:20 &ndash; What is coming in with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AureliaEffect\">Aurelia</a> next?</p>\n\n<p>31:24 &ndash; Rob: We are trying to work with as much backwards compatibility as we can. So you don&rsquo;t see a lot of the framework code in your app code. It&rsquo;s less intrusive. We are trying next, can we keep the same language, the same levels, and such but change the implementation under the hood. You don&rsquo;t learn anything new. You don&rsquo;t have new things to learn. But how it&rsquo;s implemented it&rsquo;s smaller, faster, and more efficient. We have made the framework more pluggable to the compiler-level. It&rsquo;s fully supported and super accessible.</p>\n\n<p>Frameworks will come and go &ndash; this is my belief is that you invest in the standards of the web. We are taking that up a notch. Unobtrusiveness is the next thing we want to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve always had great performance and now taking it to the next level. We are doing a lot around documentation. To help people understand what the architectural decisions are and why? We are taking it to the next level from our core. It&rsquo;s coming along swimmingly so I am really excited. We&rsquo;ve already got 90% test coverage and over 40,000 tests.</p>\n\n<p>37:33 &ndash; Chuck: Let&rsquo;s get you on JavaScript Jabber!</p>\n\n<p>38:19 &ndash; Chuck: Where can people find you?</p>\n\n<p>38:22 &ndash; Twitter, and everywhere else. <a href=\"https://aurelia.io/blog/\">Blog!</a></p>\n\n<p>39:17 &ndash; Chuck: Picks?</p>\n\n<p>39:23 &ndash; Rob dives in!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Links: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://jquery.com\">jQuery</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=javascript&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">JavaScript</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://vuejs.org\">Vue</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/\">C#</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com\">InVision</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AureliaEffect\">Aurelia</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://aurelia.io/blog/\">Aurelia Blog by Rob</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eisenbergeffect?lang=en\">Rob Eisenberg&rsquo;s Twitter</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://robeisenberg.com\">Rob&rsquo;s Website</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robeisenberg\">Rob&rsquo;s LinkedIn</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/EisenbergEffect\">Rob&rsquo;s GitHub</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/009-aia-ng-2-0-with-rob-eisenberg/\">Rob&rsquo;s Episode 9</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/080-aia-aurelia-with-rob-eisenberg/\">Rob&rsquo;s Episode 80</a></li>\n    <li>Rob&rsquo;s Episode 203</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sponsors: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/\"><strong>Get A Coder Job</strong></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com\">Fresh Books</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.cachefly.com\">Cache Fly</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Picks:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db\">Database: Orbit DB</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/203215/robit-riddle-storybook-adventures\">Robit Riddle</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://wingfeathersaga.com\">The Wingfeather Saga</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Charles</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Used to play: <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com\">Dungeons and Dragons</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.crafty-games.com/shop/little-wizards/\">Little Wizards</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.parkcity.org\">Park City, UT</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.vrbo.com/?k_clickid=EAIaIQobChMIgarx5M6L3gIVh7rACh3XtAdsEAAYAiAAEgKcHfD_BwE&amp;ds_kids=p26840931628&amp;ds_kid=43700026840931628&amp;ksprof_id=700000001561967&amp;ksdevice=c&amp;ktarget=kwd-304548565435&amp;kloct=&amp;klocf=9027224&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgarx5M6L3gIVh7rACh3XtAdsEAAYAiAAEgKcHfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">VRBO</a></li>\n</ul>\n      "

Charles and David talk about his current projects he&rsquo;s working on, plus his impressive background. Listen to them talk about JavaScript, <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++,</a> David&rsquo;s books, and much more!</p>\n\n<p>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</p>\n\n<p>1:34 &ndash; <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-203-where-to-store-angular-configurations-with-dave-bush/\">Episode 203</a>, which came out a few months ago. Check-out this past episode with David. <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-203-where-to-store-angular-configurations-with-dave-bush/\">&ldquo;Where to Store Angular Configurations&rdquo; with Dave Bush. </a></p>\n\n<p>2:13 &ndash; Chuck: We are here to catch your story. Let people know who you are.</p>\n\n<p>2:27 &ndash; David: I have been in programming for 30 years. Recently in the .NET space, and also in the Angular space for 4 years.</p>\n\n<p>3:02 &ndash; Chuck: JavaScript has been around for 20 years. How did</p>\n\n<p>3:12 &ndash; David: I need to back-up a little bit. It&rsquo;s unique. I wasn&rsquo;t raised around computers.</p>\n\n<p>3:43 &ndash; Chuck: We are having a microphone issue.</p>\n\n<p>3:55 &ndash; David: I didn&rsquo;t have access to a computer back in the day. By the time I got to college I knew summer camps and maintenance. Senior year the PC started making a break-through. I had friends who made computers in their dorm room. That looked really interesting. I mean build by soldering, and pretty hardcore. I went to engineering school. Senior year, but I went to school on a large portion of grants. It was too late to change my major. I worked for Radio Shack in Chicago. They encouraged us to bring things home. I brought these computers home and played with them. I got into Pascal among other things. I couldn&rsquo;t get Pascal to work in my brain. Next, I learned C. If I cannot make C work then I will give up and do something else with my life. C was mathematical and that&rsquo;s my brain. My wife encouraged me to go back to school &ndash; I went to DePaul through their Career Change Path.</p>\n\n<p>7:14 &ndash; Chuck.</p>\n\n<p>7:18 &ndash; David: It was similar to a boot camp.</p>\n\n<p>7:43 &ndash; David and Chuck.</p>\n\n<p>7:52 &ndash; Chuck: When did you settle on JavaScript?</p>\n\n<p>7:55 &ndash; David: <em>Settle.</em> When the Internet became publically available and wrote my website through Notepad.</p>\n\n<p>David continues this conversation.</p>\n\n<p>9:30 &ndash; Chuck: Are you primarily a Dot Net developer?</p>\n\n<p>9:43 &ndash; David: Primarily; also, <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++. </a></p>\n\n<p>10:55 &ndash; Chuck: How did you get into being self-employed?</p>\n\n<p>11:07 &ndash; David: That was the plan all along. When you are self-employed you have multiple bosses! I got fired from my last job and working with agencies. So I count that time as being self-employed then, too. In 2000, I switched to LLC and more direct contracts.</p>\n\n<p>12:45 &ndash; Chuck: How do you find contracts?</p>\n\n<p>12:51 &ndash; David: Started working for Bloomberg and then later they converted me to being an employer. It was attractive, so I am not an employee.</p>\n\n<p>13:24 &ndash; Chuck: What things are you proud of and what contributions have you made within the community?</p>\n\n<p>13:29 &ndash; David: The writing in my blogs.</p>\n\n<p>14:20 &ndash; Chuck: How do you get into blogging &ndash; and how is it successful?</p>\n\n<p>14:44 &ndash; David: Keep writing. Sometimes I think: this article will be awesome and it will fall flat. But then the times I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good those are the articles that blowup. You can&rsquo;t tell. The other thing is you need to have a thick skin.</p>\n\n<p>15:29 &ndash; Chuck: True with podcasting as well.</p>\n\n<p>15:36 &ndash; David: You will never make anyone happy. You learn to read the comment for the content and not the attitude behind it. Take the value out of the content that you can. The blog is just for me. I write so I have some place to point my colleagues to. It&rsquo;s for me to retrieve information. The blog really is for me.</p>\n\n<p>16:56 &ndash; Chuck: What are you working on now?</p>\n\n<p>17:00 &ndash; David answers this question.</p>\n\n<p>19:07 &ndash; David continues the talk.</p>\n\n<p>David: I posted my book through GitHub and took it off of Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>A long-term goal of mine is...</p>\n\n<p>I am interested in functional programming, too.</p>\n\n<p>20:41 &ndash; Chuck: That&rsquo;s cool. I am a huge fan of making things accessible of where they are at.

Recently in the .NET space, and also in the Angular space for 4 years.</p>\n\n<p>3:02 &ndash; Chuck: JavaScript has been around for 20 years. How did</p>\n\n<p>3:12 &ndash; David: I need to back-up a little bit. It&rsquo;s unique. I wasn&rsquo;t raised around computers.</p>\n\n<p>3:43 &ndash; Chuck: We are having a microphone issue.</p>\n\n<p>3:55 &ndash; David: I didn&rsquo;t have access to a computer back in the day. By the time I got to college I knew summer camps and maintenance. Senior year the PC started making a break-through. I had friends who made computers in their dorm room. That looked really interesting. I mean build by soldering, and pretty hardcore. I went to engineering school. Senior year, but I went to school on a large portion of grants. It was too late to change my major. I worked for Radio Shack in Chicago. They encouraged us to bring things home. I brought these computers home and played with them. I got into Pascal among other things. I couldn&rsquo;t get Pascal to work in my brain. Next, I learned C. If I cannot make C work then I will give up and do something else with my life. C was mathematical and that&rsquo;s my brain.

When you are self-employed you have multiple bosses! I got fired from my last job and working with agencies. So I count that time as being self-employed then, too. In 2000, I switched to LLC and more direct contracts.</p>\n\n<p>12:45 &ndash; Chuck: How do you find contracts?</p>\n\n<p>12:51 &ndash; David: Started working for Bloomberg and then later they converted me to being an employer. It was attractive, so I am not an employee.</p>\n\n<p>13:24 &ndash; Chuck: What things are you proud of and what contributions have you made within the community?</p>\n\n<p>13:29 &ndash; David: The writing in my blogs.</p>\n\n<p>14:20 &ndash; Chuck: How do you get into blogging &ndash; and how is it successful?</p>\n\n<p>14:44 &ndash; David: Keep writing.

Listen to them talk about JavaScript, <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++,</a> David&rsquo;s books, and much more!</p>\n\n<p>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</p>\n\n<p>1:34 &ndash; <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-203-where-to-store-angular-configurations-with-dave-bush/\">Episode 203</a>, which came out a few months ago. Check-out this past episode with David. <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-203-where-to-store-angular-configurations-with-dave-bush/\">&ldquo;Where to Store Angular Configurations&rdquo; with Dave Bush. </a></p>\n\n<p>2:13 &ndash; Chuck: We are here to catch your story. Let people know who you are.</p>\n\n<p>2:27 &ndash; David: I have been in programming for 30 years. Recently in the .NET space, and also in the Angular space for 4 years.</p>\n\n<p>3:02 &ndash; Chuck: JavaScript has been around for 20 years. How did</p>\n\n<p>3:12 &ndash; David: I need to back-up a little bit. It&rsquo;s unique. I wasn&rsquo;t raised around computers.</p>\n\n<p>3:43 &ndash; Chuck: We are having a microphone issue.</p>\n\n<p>3:55 &ndash; David: I didn&rsquo;t have access to a computer back in the day. By the time I got to college I knew summer camps and maintenance. Senior year the PC started making a break-through. I had friends who made computers in their dorm room. That looked really interesting. I mean build by soldering, and pretty hardcore. I went to engineering school. Senior year, but I went to school on a large portion of grants. It was too late to change my major. I worked for Radio Shack in Chicago. They encouraged us to bring things home. I brought these computers home and played with them. I got into Pascal among other things. I couldn&rsquo;t get Pascal to work in my brain. Next, I learned C. If I cannot make C work then I will give up and do something else with my life. C was mathematical and that&rsquo;s my brain. My wife encouraged me to go back to school &ndash; I went to DePaul through their Career Change Path.</p>\n\n<p>7:14 &ndash; Chuck.</p>\n\n<p>7:18 &ndash; David: It was similar to a boot camp.</p>\n\n<p>7:43 &ndash; David and Chuck.</p>\n\n<p>7:52 &ndash; Chuck: When did you settle on JavaScript?</p>\n\n<p>7:55 &ndash; David: <em>Settle.</em> When the Internet became publically available and wrote my website through Notepad.</p>\n\n<p>David continues this conversation.</p>\n\n<p>9:30 &ndash; Chuck: Are you primarily a Dot Net developer?</p>\n\n<p>9:43 &ndash; David: Primarily; also, <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com\">C++. </a></p>\n\n<p>10:55 &ndash; Chuck: How did you get into being self-employed?</p>\n\n<p>11:07 &ndash; David: That was the plan all along. When you are self-employed you have multiple bosses! I got fired from my last job and working with agencies. So I count that time as being self-employed then, too. In 2000, I switched to LLC and more direct contracts.</p>\n\n<p>12:45 &ndash; Chuck: How do you find contracts?</p>\n\n<p>12:51 &ndash; David: Started working for Bloomberg and then later they converted me to being an employer. It was attractive, so I am not an employee.</p>\n\n<p>13:24 &ndash; Chuck: What things are you proud of and what contributions have you made within the community?</p>\n\n<p>13:29 &ndash; David: The writing in my blogs.</p>\n\n<p>14:20 &ndash; Chuck: How do you get into blogging &ndash; and how is it successful?</p>\n\n<p>14:44 &ndash; David: Keep writing. Sometimes I think: this article will be awesome and it will fall flat. But then the times I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good those are the articles that blowup. You can&rsquo;t tell. The other thing is you need to have a thick skin.</p>\n\n<p>15:29 &ndash; Chuck: True with podcasting as well.</p>\n\n<p>15:36 &ndash; David: You will never make anyone happy. You learn to read the comment for the content and not the attitude behind it. Take the value out of the content that you can. The blog is just for me. I write so I have some place to point my colleagues to. It&rsquo;s for me to retrieve information. The blog really is for me.</p>\n\n<p>16:56 &ndash; Chuck: What are you working on now?</p>\n\n<p>17:00 &ndash; David answers this question.</p>\n\n<p>19:07 &ndash; David continues the talk.</p>\n\n<p>David: I posted my book through GitHub and took it off of Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>A long-term goal of mine is...</p>\n\n<p>I am interested in functional programming, too.</p>\n\n<p>20:41 &ndash; Chuck: That&rsquo;s cool. I am a huge fan of making things accessible of where they are at. The Vue portion of Angular why couldn&rsquo;t we switch that out.</p>\n\n<p>21:08 &ndash; David: Dependency injection doesn&rsquo;t mix well l with React.</p>\n\n<p>For all of my code, I put all my logic in...</p>\n\n<p>21:45 &ndash; Chuck: How can people find you?</p>\n\n<p>21:53 &ndash; David: LinkedIn is my best one. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davembush?lang=en\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/DaveMBush\">GitHub</a>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>23:09 &ndash; Chuck: LinkedIn. Facebook I am more discerning because I post pictures of my children there.</p>\n\n<p>23:41 &ndash; Chuck: Awesome &ndash; if people want to get your book?</p>\n\n<p>23:50 &ndash; David: I will send you those links.

She does <a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a> work there with a small team. She specializes in information technology and services. Rachel (Rae) and Chuck talk about Angular and how she got her amazing job through a Twitter connection!</p>\n\n<p>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</p>\n\n<p>1:30 &ndash; Hello!</p>\n\n<p>1:35 &ndash; Rae, please give us your background.</p>\n\n<p>2:25 &ndash; Chuck: Tina&rsquo;s interview will go live later on another episode. It&rsquo;s interesting</p>\n\n<p>How did you get into coding?</p>\n\n<p>2:50 &ndash; Rae: I started on a course 4 or 5 years ago. I moved to Akron, Ohio with the WOMEN and TECH group here, and got involved with the group. Free code camp and so on. Through meeting this Meetup I found a new position. This led to Angular development. I enjoyed the DevOps, but this Toll Wave is awesome! I have been working there for 9-10 months.</p>\n\n<p>4:45 &ndash; Chuck: Why <a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a> and not Vue or Java?</p>\n\n<p>4:52 &ndash; Rae: I started a side project with Angular with friends. They had a strong view with Angular, because Angular dealt with a lot of security issues. Since then I am pretty solid on the Angular side. The React side, I guess, is cool.</p>\n\n<p>5:53 &ndash; Chuck: People tend to go towards technologies that they can get help with. It makes sense why you went with Angular. Is there anyone specific that got you into Angular?</p>\n\n<p>6:23 &ndash; Rae: I didn&rsquo;t have a network at the time. The 2 people that got me into Angular actually weren&rsquo;t developers. I started with Docs and the <a href=\"https://angular.io/tutorial\">Heroes</a> actually were a great resource. It covers these pieces that are necessary to know how it works. I used early on NG docs, too.</p>\n\n<p>7:24 &ndash; Chuck: Actually that is organized by...</p>\n\n<p>7:42 &ndash; Chuck: Getting your job is very interesting. I a m writing a book on how to find a job as a software developer. I see that people are struggling with this. What did you have in place to show them that you were capable for the job?</p>\n\n<p>8:18 &ndash; Rae: The interview was very conversational. It wasn&rsquo;t algorithm tests; nothing super fancy. It really got into the work I&rsquo;ve done and my thought process. I appreciated that the interview was realistic. I can go back to other traditionally other interview were &ldquo;tougher.&rdquo; I had to do an algorithm test. I sat down and I was terrified for that. It was more &ldquo;simple&rdquo; for the entry-level people. The saving grace is if you are frozen &ndash; just talk about the process. They want to see how you would talk through the process &ndash; they want to see that. You just have to know people. This Twitter job happened because of a network effect.</p>\n\n<p>10:19 &ndash; Chuck: Yes, very true. It is a lot easier to get a job that someone can just introduce you to the company then trying to do it all yourself. Creating those opportunities through the people you know.</p>\n\n<p>10:56 &ndash; Chuck: What are you doing now?</p>\n\n<p>11:01 &ndash; Rae: Financial management application. It&rsquo;s secret right now.</p>\n\n<p>In my free time, it is very hard to push through one thing. The latest thing I have been doing lately is the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/\">Rust Programming Book</a>. I have talked with my director that I enjoy Angular but I don&rsquo;t want to do just frontend. He&rsquo;s been really great about it. He&rsquo;s talking with other program managers to get involved with other projects that are coming in. I have tried to look at React. I cannot make myself do it. If you are good at one, then why would you learn the other one? Only reason to learn React is if I want a React job.</p>\n\n<p>13:12 &ndash; Chuck: People say to me that they want to stay current and also job availability. If my current situation changes then I can adopt any technology that they change to.</p>\n\n<p>13:58 &ndash; Rae: I have been wanting to look at Vue. I don&rsquo;t know anything about Vue other than the inventor of it. It would be fun to play with the differences.</p>\n\n<p>14:42 &ndash; Chuck adds his comments.</p>\n\n<p>14:50 &ndash; Rae: There are so many different things out there to learn!</p>\n\n<p>Different languages &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to limit myself to limited languages within a 40-minute talk.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke at the following conferences recently:</p>\n\n<p>1.) <a href=\"https://speakers.codemash.org/test/speakers.htm\">Codemash in Ohio</a></p>\n\n<p>2.) Meetups in Grand Rapids (Software Craftsmanship)</p>\n\n<p>3.) Self Conference in Detroit (no recordings)</p>\n\n<p>4.) <a href=\"https://www.fullstackfest.com/speakers/raekrantz/\">Full Stack Fest in Barcelona</a> &ndash; the best conference ever because it was so well organized. The attention to detail was amazing.</p>\n\n<p>17:09 &ndash; Chuck adds his comments.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah we will encourage people to look into your talks!</p>\n\n<p>17:24 &ndash; Rae: Neat!</p>\n\n<p>Rae talks about workshops and typical <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com\">Meetups.</a></p>\n\n<p>Cleveland area &ndash; October 6<sup>th</sup> &ndash; learn how to code &ndash; it will be fun!</p>\n\n<p>18:25 &ndash; Chuck: <a href=\"http://ng-girls.org\">ngGirls.org</a></p>\n\n<p>18:40 &ndash; Chuck: Any advice for someone getting into tech?</p>\n\n<p>18:50 &ndash; Rae: Do it before you have kids. Your energy is at a low when you have kids and you don&rsquo;t have the energy to work on the things you want to work on.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have kids then use your Netflix time now and STUDY!</p>\n\n<p>If I can get through a chapter a day &ndash; that is fantastic &ndash; with life with kids. I work through lunches a lot. I try to use my day care time with care.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s great to be at a conference without a kid.</p>\n\n<p>22:06 &ndash; Chuck: I have 5 kids. My oldest is 12 &ndash; so that is fine, but my youngest is 3.</p>\n\n<p>The way we do it is I travel more than my wife. She&rsquo;s a trooper to take care of the kids. I send her on a trip to see her best friend in North Carolina.</p>\n\n<p>22:52 &ndash; Chuck: People are paying attention to people have different circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>23:06 &ndash; Chuck: The last thing I want to ask is anything you are looking forward to in the future? Where do you want to wind-up?</p>\n\n<p>23:25 &ndash; Rae talks about her hopes and dreams.</p>\n\n<p>Rae: The puzzle aspect, I like. I like making things work together. The larger scope is what I like. In terms of the languages I take as they come.<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/\"> Rust</a>, yes, I would like to use that a few years down the line.

She does <a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a> work there with a small team. She specializes in information technology and services. Rachel (Rae) and Chuck talk about Angular and how she got her amazing job through a Twitter connection!</p>\n\n<p>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</p>\n\n<p>1:30 &ndash; Hello!</p>\n\n<p>1:35 &ndash; Rae, please give us your background.</p>\n\n<p>2:25 &ndash; Chuck: Tina&rsquo;s interview will go live later on another episode. It&rsquo;s interesting</p>\n\n<p>How did you get into coding?</p>\n\n<p>2:50 &ndash; Rae: I started on a course 4 or 5 years ago. I moved to Akron, Ohio with the WOMEN and TECH group here, and got involved with the group. Free code camp and so on. Through meeting this Meetup I found a new position. This led to Angular development. I enjoyed the DevOps, but this Toll Wave is awesome! I have been working there for 9-10 months.</p>\n\n<p>4:45 &ndash; Chuck: Why <a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a> and not Vue or Java?</p>\n\n<p>4:52 &ndash; Rae: I started a side project with Angular with friends. They had a strong view with Angular, because Angular dealt with a lot of security issues. Since then I am pretty solid on the Angular side. The React side, I guess, is cool.</p>\n\n<p>5:53 &ndash; Chuck: People tend to go towards technologies that they can get help with. It makes sense why you went with Angular. Is there anyone specific that got you into Angular?</p>\n\n<p>6:23 &ndash; Rae: I didn&rsquo;t have a network at the time. The 2 people that got me into Angular actually weren&rsquo;t developers. I started with Docs and the <a href=\"https://angular.io/tutorial\">Heroes</a> actually were a great resource. It covers these pieces that are necessary to know how it works. I used early on NG docs, too.</p>\n\n<p>7:24 &ndash; Chuck: Actually that is organized by...</p>\n\n<p>7:42 &ndash; Chuck: Getting your job is very interesting. I a m writing a book on how to find a job as a software developer. I see that people are struggling with this. What did you have in place to show them that you were capable for the job?</p>\n\n<p>8:18 &ndash; Rae: The interview was very conversational. It wasn&rsquo;t algorithm tests; nothing super fancy. It really got into the work I&rsquo;ve done and my thought process. I appreciated that the interview was realistic. I can go back to other traditionally other interview were &ldquo;tougher.&rdquo; I had to do an algorithm test. I sat down and I was terrified for that. It was more &ldquo;simple&rdquo; for the entry-level people. The saving grace is if you are frozen &ndash; just talk about the process. They want to see how you would talk through the process &ndash; they want to see that. You just have to know people. This Twitter job happened because of a network effect.</p>\n\n<p>10:19 &ndash; Chuck: Yes, very true. It is a lot easier to get a job that someone can just introduce you to the company then trying to do it all yourself. Creating those opportunities through the people you know.</p>\n\n<p>10:56 &ndash; Chuck: What are you doing now?</p>\n\n<p>11:01 &ndash; Rae: Financial management application. It&rsquo;s secret right now.</p>\n\n<p>In my free time, it is very hard to push through one thing. The latest thing I have been doing lately is the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/\">Rust Programming Book</a>. I have talked with my director that I enjoy Angular but I don&rsquo;t want to do just frontend. He&rsquo;s been really great about it. He&rsquo;s talking with other program managers to get involved with other projects that are coming in. I have tried to look at React. I cannot make myself do it. If you are good at one, then why would you learn the other one? Only reason to learn React is if I want a React job.</p>\n\n<p>13:12 &ndash; Chuck: People say to me that they want to stay current and also job availability. If my current situation changes then I can adopt any technology that they change to.</p>\n\n<p>13:58 &ndash; Rae: I have been wanting to look at Vue. I don&rsquo;t know anything about Vue other than the inventor of it. It would be fun to play with the differences.</p>\n\n<p>14:42 &ndash; Chuck adds his comments.</p>\n\n<p>14:50 &ndash; Rae: There are so many different things out there to learn!</p>\n\n<p>Different languages &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to limit myself to limited languages within a 40-minute talk.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke at the following conferences recently:</p>\n\n<p>1.) <a href=\"https://speakers.codemash.org/test/speakers.htm\">Codemash in Ohio</a></p>\n\n<p>2.)

She does <a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a> work there with a small team. She specializes in information technology and services. Rachel (Rae) and Chuck talk about Angular and how she got her amazing job through a Twitter connection!</p>\n\n<p>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</p>\n\n<p>1:30 &ndash; Hello!</p>\n\n<p>1:35 &ndash; Rae, please give us your background.</p>\n\n<p>2:25 &ndash; Chuck: Tina&rsquo;s interview will go live later on another episode. It&rsquo;s interesting</p>\n\n<p>How did you get into coding?</p>\n\n<p>2:50 &ndash; Rae: I started on a course 4 or 5 years ago. I moved to Akron, Ohio with the WOMEN and TECH group here, and got involved with the group. Free code camp and so on. Through meeting this Meetup I found a new position. This led to Angular development. I enjoyed the DevOps, but this Toll Wave is awesome! I have been working there for 9-10 months.</p>\n\n<p>4:45 &ndash; Chuck: Why <a href=\"https://angular.io\">Angular</a> and not Vue or Java?</p>\n\n<p>4:52 &ndash; Rae: I started a side project with Angular with friends. They had a strong view with Angular, because Angular dealt with a lot of security issues. Since then I am pretty solid on the Angular side. The React side, I guess, is cool.</p>\n\n<p>5:53 &ndash; Chuck: People tend to go towards technologies that they can get help with. It makes sense why you went with Angular. Is there anyone specific that got you into Angular?</p>\n\n<p>6:23 &ndash; Rae: I didn&rsquo;t have a network at the time. The 2 people that got me into Angular actually weren&rsquo;t developers. I started with Docs and the <a href=\"https://angular.io/tutorial\">Heroes</a> actually were a great resource. It covers these pieces that are necessary to know how it works. I used early on NG docs, too.</p>\n\n<p>7:24 &ndash; Chuck: Actually that is organized by...</p>\n\n<p>7:42 &ndash; Chuck: Getting your job is very interesting. I a m writing a book on how to find a job as a software developer. I see that people are struggling with this. What did you have in place to show them that you were capable for the job?</p>\n\n<p>8:18 &ndash; Rae: The interview was very conversational. It wasn&rsquo;t algorithm tests; nothing super fancy. It really got into the work I&rsquo;ve done and my thought process. I appreciated that the interview was realistic. I can go back to other traditionally other interview were &ldquo;tougher.&rdquo; I had to do an algorithm test. I sat down and I was terrified for that. It was more &ldquo;simple&rdquo; for the entry-level people. The saving grace is if you are frozen &ndash; just talk about the process. They want to see how you would talk through the process &ndash; they want to see that. You just have to know people. This Twitter job happened because of a network effect.</p>\n\n<p>10:19 &ndash; Chuck: Yes, very true. It is a lot easier to get a job that someone can just introduce you to the company then trying to do it all yourself. Creating those opportunities through the people you know.</p>\n\n<p>10:56 &ndash; Chuck: What are you doing now?</p>\n\n<p>11:01 &ndash; Rae: Financial management application. It&rsquo;s secret right now.</p>\n\n<p>In my free time, it is very hard to push through one thing. The latest thing I have been doing lately is the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/\">Rust Programming Book</a>. I have talked with my director that I enjoy Angular but I don&rsquo;t want to do just frontend. He&rsquo;s been really great about it. He&rsquo;s talking with other program managers to get involved with other projects that are coming in. I have tried to look at React. I cannot make myself do it. If you are good at one, then why would you learn the other one? Only reason to learn React is if I want a React job.</p>\n\n<p>13:12 &ndash; Chuck: People say to me that they want to stay current and also job availability. If my current situation changes then I can adopt any technology that they change to.</p>\n\n<p>13:58 &ndash; Rae: I have been wanting to look at Vue. I don&rsquo;t know anything about Vue other than the inventor of it. It would be fun to play with the differences.</p>\n\n<p>14:42 &ndash; Chuck adds his comments.</p>\n\n<p>14:50 &ndash; Rae: There are so many different things out there to learn!</p>\n\n<p>Different languages &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to limit myself to limited languages within a 40-minute talk.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke at the following conferences recently:</p>\n\n<p>1.) <a href=\"https://speakers.codemash.org/test/speakers.htm\">Codemash in Ohio</a></p>\n\n<p>2.) Meetups in Grand Rapids (Software Craftsmanship)</p>\n\n<p>3.) Self Conference in Detroit (no recordings)</p>\n\n<p>4.) <a href=\"https://www.fullstackfest.com/speakers/raekrantz/\">Full Stack Fest in Barcelona</a> &ndash; the best conference ever because it was so well organized. The attention to detail was amazing.</p>\n\n<p>17:09 &ndash; Chuck adds his comments.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah we will encourage people to look into your talks!</p>\n\n<p>17:24 &ndash; Rae: Neat!</p>\n\n<p>Rae talks about workshops and typical <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com\">Meetups.</a></p>\n\n<p>Cleveland area &ndash; October 6<sup>th</sup> &ndash; learn how to code &ndash; it will be fun!</p>\n\n<p>18:25 &ndash; Chuck: <a href=\"http://ng-girls.org\">ngGirls.org</a></p>\n\n<p>18:40 &ndash; Chuck: Any advice for someone getting into tech?</p>\n\n<p>18:50 &ndash; Rae: Do it before you have kids. Your energy is at a low when you have kids and you don&rsquo;t have the energy to work on the things you want to work on.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have kids then use your Netflix time now and STUDY!</p>\n\n<p>If I can get through a chapter a day &ndash; that is fantastic &ndash; with life with kids. I work through lunches a lot. I try to use my day care time with care.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s great to be at a conference without a kid.</p>\n\n<p>22:06 &ndash; Chuck: I have 5 kids.

That was fun, and did a lot of that there, which got me into programming. I had a Bachelor&rsquo;s in Business. Went to get my Master&rsquo;s in Computer Science, but took along time. Started doing IT recruiting. Then next thing you know I moved into my parents&rsquo; house and did coder camps. And that worked out. Then I got hired by the Charter Internet Company.

There is another person on the other end helping others.</p>\n\n<p>13:06 &ndash; Guest: I could be doing CSS but I rather be doing this instead. I don&rsquo;t mind answering any questions or prodding the person to get more information. &ldquo;What are the steps to recreate it?&rdquo; And my answer was...</p>\n\n<p>14:09 &ndash; Chuck: I worked through Q/A for a while. And it is interesting.</p>\n\n<p>14:25 &ndash; You don&rsquo;t want to brush them off completely because they are obviously frustrated.</p>\n\n<p>14:43 &ndash; Chuck: What are you working on now.</p>\n\n<p>14:50 &ndash; Guest answers question.</p>\n\n<p>15:03 &ndash; Chuck: Anything you&rsquo;d like for people to know about you?</p>\n\n<p>15:22 &ndash; Guest: I can make something up real quick...</p>\n\n<p>15:30 &ndash; Chuck: How you are contributing is awesome, just thought to ask.</p>\n\n<p>15:48 &ndash; Guest: I do enjoy helping out in the chat community.

A full-timer works as a part of the team in Google.</p>\n\n<p>In his experience as an intern in the Angular team, he had knowledge on the Angular 1 which made him do similar responsibilities with other team&nbsp;members, particularly working on the core. He realized that it&#39;s more about your knowledge than your employment status.</p>\n\n<p>He was with the Angular core team around 2014 or 2015. When he&nbsp;released a new version, it&nbsp;had a bug that brought down a lot of tests inside Google. It ended up like the name collision was a library used by many Google&#39;s Angular applications used internally.</p>\n\n<p>He, along with the team, figured out its naming inclusion and ended up making its property become unique. They added his favorite number to it which was 339. If you look at any element in Angular 1, you would find a property called&nbsp;NG 339.</p>\n\n<p>To hear the rest of&nbsp;<em>My Angular Rodric Haddad</em>, download and listen&nbsp;to the entire episode.</p>\n\n<p>Get in touch&nbsp;with Rodric&nbsp;and learn more about him by following him on Twitter and by liking his Facebook page Coddict.

Mike is a software engineer at <a href=\"http://www.synapse-wireless.com/\">Synapse</a> in Alabama and works as a tech lead there.

Listen to learn more about Gil and his story!</p>\n\n<p><strong>[00:02:16] Introduction to Gil </strong></p>\n\n<p>Gil is the CEO of Sparxys, a consulting company he created. wrote a book called the <em>Pro Single Page Application Development</em>. He was a co-organizer of Angular App, which is a conference in Israel, which was held just last month.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[00:04:39] How did you get into programming?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gil first owned a computer at ten years old. It was an IBM compatible computer with an MS-DOS operating system. He used it to play games like Pac Man, which he would attempt to edit and claims was the first time he tried to program anything. Gil wanted to learn computer science in high school. In grades tenth through twelfth, he learned Turbo Pascal and Excel. During this time he wrote unprofessional programs. He went to college for computer science. His first job as a web developer was helping to write a government portal for the Israeli government.</p>\n\n<p>What ultimately led him to computer science is the curiosity to know how things that operate hardware work. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re curious about something, go and learn it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>[00:12:12] How did you go from government to working with Angular? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Gil describes his story to Angular as one of progression and &ldquo;moving on with everybody else.&rdquo; He worked with the government project from 2005-2007. He was then involved with a web app project using jQuery and Backbone. The VP while he was at the job asked why he was using backbone, so Gil researched Angular. It looked like it included everything he needed. After reading more on it, he began using it and created an Angular JS course for his employer. He learned it through creating that course.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[00:15:35] What was it about Angular that made you decide you wanted to be doing it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gil thinks the community is one of the best things about Angular. The team is approachable. Gil had issues with other libraries and did not get the same vibe from people. They were not as welcoming and eager to help as they are in the Angular community. There is a lot of collaboration. The tools and frameworks around Angular are developing and people help each other as they develop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[00:23:30] Contributions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gil has made several contributions to the Angular community. Most recently he has created the Angular 2-indexeddb service. It is a library that can be found GitHub. He has written directives in the past that people use and is amazed that people use things that he wrote. He wrote Story.js, another library that wrapped all storages in one browser, which he does recommend anyone use. He has published several online videos and was featured on an Angular Connect workshop recently.</p>\n\n<p>Gil is always willing to help mentor other developers. He has started writing blog posts in order to help junior freelancers. Currently he is involved with two start up accelerators. They are Google Launchpad Accelerator and University Accelerator. Both are where people come with ideas and they help make their ideas startups.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Picks</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Gil</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-Israel/events/236498872/\">Goodness Squad</a></li>\n    <li>Angular2-indexeddb Library</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.spidermanhomecoming.com/\">Spider-Man Homecoming&nbsp;</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Charles</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>The Millionaire Mind</li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://devchat.tv/freelancers\">The Freelancer Show&nbsp;</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.toastmasters.org/\">Toastmasters club&nbsp;</a></li>\n    <li>Angular Dev Summit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Links</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gilfink\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://gilfink.azurewebsites.net/\">http://gilfink.azurewebsites.net/</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@gilfink/\">Medium&nbsp;</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.sparxys.com/\">Sparxys</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n \n",

He joined the Adventures in Angular Slack, where he was asked to be on the show. Listen to learn more about Kion and his story!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you get started programming?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kion didn&rsquo;t start programming in high school like most. In college, he studied to be an engineer. In his second semester, he took a programming course, which was his first introduction to programming. It was the only class that appealed to him. He left the degree and spent two to three years trying to figure out what to do next. During this time he taught high school chemistry and math. During this time he built his mom something in Access to help her organize her office. He also built the private school he was working for something to help track what classes students were taking. That really made him want to begin programming. He found a degree that focused on computer information systems after that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you get from that to doing web development and JavaScript?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kion started his degree in 2004 and was still teaching while doing his degree. During his last year, he found a job at a help desk where he was working with training software. His boss saw that he had an aptitude for programming, so Kion was asked to help that department. He worked with a web application, which was his first taste in professional programming. Since then he has been mostly doing web stuff.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you get into Angular?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After his first job as a programmer, he ended up in another company working with insurance application. He was exploring options for external and was made to investigate Angular. He wanted to have something user-friendly, responsive, and interactive as a front end to that portal. In 2014 Angular had what he was looking for in a JavaScript framework. He built an initial prototype over a weekend, which convinced everyone at work to use it. The project was built in a little over six months. It was functional, quick, and everyone was impressed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you want to talk a little about your experience upgrading an Angular JS app to Angular? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Once he got started with the project he started hearing about a new Angular project. Just as his project was released in 2014, it was announced. It made him pay attention in most of 2014 to what was going on in the Angular community in 2014. He wanted to be informed and know what to expect. In 2015 he would try new projects just for him to make sure he was able to use the new information that was being released. In 2016 he really became ready to start rewriting everything. He wasn&rsquo;t averse to the idea of rewriting but wanted to be able to do it quickly. He began the process of migration in his spare time at first. He did not think it was a painful process; he found it somewhat simple once the setup was started. Moving the system was the hardest part; how to get the system setup.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How many hours did you put in personally before you really knew what you were going to do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kion put in quite a few hours before he knew what he was going to do. He saw it as an investment because afterward, he had a new tool to use. The industry is always changing, and because of this, you have to learn how to learn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your approach to keeping up on this stuff?</strong></p>\n\n<p>His approach to keeping up on things is to read articles and have subscriptions to courses. He listens to Ruby Rogues, JavaScript Jabber, and Adventures in Angular. You can&rsquo;t keep up with everything, you have to focus on one area and pick what you stay current on the most.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Picks</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Kion</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Angular documentation &ndash; <a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/api\">https://docs.angularjs.org/api</a></li>\n    <li>Big Bang Theory <a href=\"https://the-big-bang-theory.com/\">https://the-big-bang-theory.com/</a><br />\n    Silicon Valley <a href=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/\">www.siliconvalley.com/</a></li>\n    <li>Ng-Conf <a href=\"https://www.ng-conf.org/\">https://www.ng-conf.org/</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Charles</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Seinfeld <a href=\"http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/seinfeld/\">http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/seinfeld/</a></li>\n    <li>Stranger Things <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things</a></li>\n    <li>Frontend masters <a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/\">https://frontendmasters.com/</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://ngdoc.io/\">http://ngdoc.io/</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Links</strong></p>\n\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/snorkpete\">https://github.com/snorkpete</a></p>\n \n",

During this time he built his mom something in Access to help her organize her office. He also built the private school he was working for something to help track what classes students were taking. That really made him want to begin programming. He found a degree that focused on computer information systems after that.\nHow did you get from that to doing web development and JavaScript?\nKion started his degree in 2004 and was still teaching while doing his degree. During his last year, he found a job at a help desk where he was working with training software. His boss saw that he had an aptitude for programming, so Kion was asked to help that department. He worked with a web application, which was his first taste in professional programming. Since then he has been mostly doing web stuff.\nHow did you get into Angular?\nAfter his first job as a programmer, he ended up in another company working with insurance application. He was exploring options for external and was made to investigate Angular. He wanted to have something user-friendly, responsive, and interactive as a front end to that portal. In 2014 Angular had what he was looking for in a JavaScript framework. He built an initial prototype over a weekend, which convinced everyone at work to use it. The project was built in a little over six months. It was functional, quick, and everyone was impressed.\nDo you want to talk a little about your experience upgrading an Angular JS app to Angular? \nOnce he got started with the project he started hearing about a new Angular project. Just as his project was released in 2014, it was announced. It made him pay attention in most of 2014 to what was going on in the Angular community in 2014. He wanted to be informed and know what to expect. In 2015 he would try new projects just for him to make sure he was able to use the new information that was being released. In 2016 he really became ready to start rewriting everything. He wasn\u2019t averse to the idea of rewriting but wanted to be able to do it quickly. He began the process of migration in his spare time at first. He did not think it was a painful process; he found it somewhat simple once the setup was started. Moving the system was the hardest part; how to get the system setup.\nHow many hours did you put in personally before you really knew what you were going to do?\nKion put in quite a few hours before he knew what he was going to do. He saw it as an investment because afterward, he had a new tool to use. The industry is always changing, and because of this, you have to learn how to learn.\nWhat\u2019s your approach to keeping up on this stuff?\nHis approach to keeping up on things is to read articles and have subscriptions to courses. He listens to Ruby Rogues, JavaScript Jabber, and Adventures in Angular. You can\u2019t keep up with everything, you have to focus on one area and pick what you stay current on the most.\nPicks\nKion\nAngular documentation \u2013 https://docs.angularjs.org/api\nBig Bang Theory https://the-big-bang-theory.com/\nwww.siliconvalley.com/\nNg-Conf https://www.ng-conf.org/\nCharles\nSeinfeld http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/seinfeld/\nStranger Things https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things\nFrontend masters https://frontendmasters.com/\nhttp://ngdoc.io/\nLinks\nGitHub: https://github.com/snorkpete",

Chris works at Microsoft, specifically on Azure Functions and WebJobs SDK. Hear how he got his start, how he has contributed to the community, as well as a bit about what it&rsquo;s like being a Program Manager for Microsoft. Stay tuned!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h5>How did you get into programming?</h5>\n<p>In College Chris was an aerospace engineer. His first taste of working with code was at an internship at Lockheed Martin. Most of his daily work was with spread sheets so he learned Visual Basic to help handle that. He found himself interested in writing code more so he took an intro in C summer course and then things snowballed. When he finished that semester, he talked to advisor about switching to Computer Science. Immediately landed into JavaScript. Chris talks about having a &lsquo;clicking moment&rsquo; while in a topics class. A classmate was talking about NodeJS and so he tried it out and hasn&rsquo;t stopped using it since.</p>\n\n<h5>What about programing appealed to you?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris says that programming made him have a sense of having superpowers. In aerospace he learned how planes worked and that was fun, but programming had an immediately feedback on what he was working on. He adds that it made sense in the way that programming is a universal toolset for no matter what field you&rsquo;re in. Charles adds that dug into coding after working in tech support and needing it, then seeing how relevant and useful it was.</p>\n\n<h5>Have you worked with JavaScript before learning about Node?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris&rsquo; first real coding experience was with his internship. He taught himself JavaScript on the job and after a few months found himself really liking it. He felt like JavaScript felt more natural and expressive. Javascript empowered him to work on the client side and the server side and he felt empowered to do full stack.</p>\n\n<h5>What about Microsoft?</h5>\n\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s hiring process for college graduates you apply the year you graduate and go through a handful of interviews. He got hired into a team working on databases, working in SQL server. He wanted to work in developer tools and learned how to use power shell and SQL works and how powerful it was. He started moving back and pushing NodeJS onto SQL. There was a driver for SQL purely in JavaScript called TDS and he would make pull requests and contributed to that. He talks about searching internally looking for other work and finding a mobile services team that needed a NodeJS person so he started there. Later he started WebJobs and then later Functions, as an effort to make NodeJS technology work with a .Net technology called Webjobs SDK. Functions exists because he wanted to add a NodeJS to a .Net product.</p>\n\n<h5>Did you find pushing NodeJS into a well developed language ecosystem risky?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris talks about helping push adoption of .Net and creating prototype ideas, and it sparking from that. His goal was to make customers more productive.</p>\n\n<h5>It sounds like you guys just have fun at work?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris talks about the team culture being fun at times. Sometimes as a developer you get buffered by Project Managers, but in the case developers spend a lot of time talking to customers. They are excited so they have loads of interactions, helping develop diverse ideas. Charles adds that the preconception to how the environment feels in Microsoft tends to be negative but from talking to people who work there, things seem to be more open than expected. Chris points to open source concepts that really makes working with Microsoft great.</p>\n\n<h5>What does a Program Manager do on a team?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris talks about how his job is to explore the issues and talk to customers and then prioritize how to make things better. He talks about doing whatever he can to make the product successful with the customers, including building a prototype of an idea, taking a sort of position similar to an entrepreneur. Charles adds that it&rsquo;s refreshing to find that someone in the Program Manager also being technical sufficient and hands on. Chris talks about how teams are built naturally and pulled together with a group of people who love what they are doing.</p>\n\n<h5>Does the Azure Functions team use Azure Functions to make Azure Functions work?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris talks about not using Azure functions under the covers, for the most part it&rsquo;s built on top of the app service technology stack like web apps and mobile apps. Things that power that is what powers the Azure functions, like Angular. A lot of the engineering pieces are on top of that. They do use Azure for various Microsoft internal things. All of the tests they build are functions to test functions.</p>\n\n<h5>How did you and your team come to use Angular?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris was working on the prototype for Azure Functions. Amed had experience with working on front end applications and he wanted to try out Angular 2 even though it was still in beta. He found that had the right amount of stuff out of the box. Additionally it had typescript which meshed well. They tend to pick things that people on the team know well and not as much as trying to stay tied into Microsoft supported systems. Chris talks about doing one or two major refactoring.</p>\n\n<h5>How much Angular have you worked on yourself?</h5>\n\n<p>Amed works the most on Angular, Chris&rsquo; job as Program Manager puts in him a place where his commits don&rsquo;t go into production, but he will often write prototypes. He played around a lot with the Monaco editor and adding features for that. As far as outside of that, he has written a few tutorials for using Functions plus Angular as well as written his wedding website with Angular.</p>\n\n<h5>What other extracurricular projects have you worked on?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris talks about doing a lot of side projects for a while. One working with ExpressSocket.io. He also built a middleware project where you can write middleware into Functions. Plenty of little projects he puts on GitHub and never finish. Chris talks about wishing he could switch hats between being the Program Manager and a developer.</p>\n\n<h5>Is there anything in particular you feel like you&rsquo;ve contributed to Angular?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris talks about improving by putting in loads of pull requests for tons of JavaScript libraries and a few NodeJS libraries. He would like to be more involved in the start of those processes. Chris says he hopes to maybe be involved in the next Node version update. He really likes the Node community.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h4>Picks</h4>\n<h5>Chris</h5>\n\n<p>Mountain Dew Pitch Black<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse\">The Expanse Series on SciFi</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/\">Application Insights</a></p>\n\n<h5>Charles</h5>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Eye-World-Wheel-Time-Book/dp/0812511816\">Wheel of Time</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coolidge-Amity-Shlaes/dp/0061967599\">Coolage</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Company-American-Soldiers-Abandoned/dp/1478908505\">Dog Company</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/lpg/?utm_source=Advertisement&amp;utm_medium=GoogleAdsBrand&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleAdsBrand-US&amp;utm_content=Datadog&amp;utm_keyword=%7Bkeyword%7D&amp;utm_matchtype=%7Bmatchtype%7D&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgOmj1qzi1AIV2B6BCh26hgIgEAAYASAAEgIvuvD_BwE\">Data Dog</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n<h4>Links</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/crandycodes?lang=en\">Twitter</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/christopheranderson\">GitHub</a></p>\n\n<hr /> \n",

All of the tests they build are functions to test functions.</p>\n\n<h5>How did you and your team come to use Angular?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris was working on the prototype for Azure Functions. Amed had experience with working on front end applications and he wanted to try out Angular 2 even though it was still in beta. He found that had the right amount of stuff out of the box. Additionally it had typescript which meshed well. They tend to pick things that people on the team know well and not as much as trying to stay tied into Microsoft supported systems. Chris talks about doing one or two major refactoring.</p>\n\n<h5>How much Angular have you worked on yourself?</h5>\n\n<p>Amed works the most on Angular, Chris&rsquo; job as Program Manager puts in him a place where his commits don&rsquo;t go into production, but he will often write prototypes. He played around a lot with the Monaco editor and adding features for that. As far as outside of that, he has written a few tutorials for using Functions plus Angular as well as written his wedding website with Angular.</p>\n\n<h5>What other extracurricular projects have you worked on?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris talks about doing a lot of side projects for a while. One working with ExpressSocket.io. He also built a middleware project where you can write middleware into Functions. Plenty of little projects he puts on GitHub and never finish. Chris talks about wishing he could switch hats between being the Program Manager and a developer.</p>\n\n<h5>Is there anything in particular you feel like you&rsquo;ve contributed to Angular?</h5>\n\n<p>Chris talks about improving by putting in loads of pull requests for tons of JavaScript libraries and a few NodeJS libraries.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "MAS 016 Chris Anderson\nIn this episode we have a My Angular Story and our guest is Chris Anderson. Chris works at Microsoft, specifically on Azure Functions and WebJobs SDK. Hear how he got his start, how he has contributed to the community, as well as a bit about what it\u2019s like being a Program Manager for Microsoft. Stay tuned!\n\nHow did you get into programming?\nIn College Chris was an aerospace engineer. His first taste of working with code was at an internship at Lockheed Martin. Most of his daily work was with spread sheets so he learned Visual Basic to help handle that. He found himself interested in writing code more so he took an intro in C summer course and then things snowballed. When he finished that semester, he talked to advisor about switching to Computer Science. Immediately landed into JavaScript. Chris talks about having a \u2018clicking moment\u2019 while in a topics class. A classmate was talking about NodeJS and so he tried it out and hasn\u2019t stopped using it since.\nWhat about programing appealed to you?\nChris says that programming made him have a sense of having superpowers. In aerospace he learned how planes worked and that was fun, but programming had an immediately feedback on what he was working on. He adds that it made sense in the way that programming is a universal toolset for no matter what field you\u2019re in. Charles adds that dug into coding after working in tech support and needing it, then seeing how relevant and useful it was.\nHave you worked with JavaScript before learning about Node?\nChris\u2019 first real coding experience was with his internship. He taught himself JavaScript on the job and after a few months found himself really liking it. He felt like JavaScript felt more natural and expressive. Javascript empowered him to work on the client side and the server side and he felt empowered to do full stack.\nWhat about Microsoft?\nMicrosoft\u2019s hiring process for college graduates you apply the year you graduate and go through a handful of interviews. He got hired into a team working on databases, working in SQL server. He wanted to work in developer tools and learned how to use power shell and SQL works and how powerful it was. He started moving back and pushing NodeJS onto SQL. There was a driver for SQL purely in JavaScript called TDS and he would make pull requests and contributed to that. He talks about searching internally looking for other work and finding a mobile services team that needed a NodeJS person so he started there. Later he started WebJobs and then later Functions, as an effort to make NodeJS technology work with a .Net technology called Webjobs SDK. Functions exists because he wanted to add a NodeJS to a .Net product.\nDid you find pushing NodeJS into a well developed language ecosystem risky?\nChris talks about helping push adoption of .Net and creating prototype ideas, and it sparking from that. His goal was to make customers more productive.\nIt sounds like you guys just have fun at work?\nChris talks about the team culture being fun at times. Sometimes as a developer you get buffered by Project Managers, but in the case developers spend a lot of time talking to customers. They are excited so they have loads of interactions, helping develop diverse ideas. Charles adds that the preconception to how the environment feels in Microsoft tends to be negative but from talking to people who work there, things seem to be more open than expected. Chris points to open source concepts that really makes working with Microsoft great.\nWhat does a Program Manager do on a team?\nChris talks about how his job is to explore the issues and talk to customers and then prioritize how to make things better. He talks about doing whatever he can to make the product successful with the customers, including building a prototype of an idea, taking a sort of position similar to an entrepreneur. Charles adds that it\u2019s refreshing to find that someone in the Program Manager also being technical sufficient and hands on.

Danny is a Google Developer Expert for web technologies. In this episode we hear the story about how Danny first started coding, a method suggestion for picking a frameworks, and how vocabulary is vital for a new programmer to learn. It&rsquo;s a good one, stay tuned.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h4>How did you get into programming?</h4>\n<p>Didn&rsquo;t get started until college. In school he was under the impression that you had to be a math genius to be a programmer. Didn&rsquo;t even try until college. He wish he would have taken more in College. His first dive into code was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript\">ActionScript 2</a>. He was offered a class that taught how to make Flash games and he took the class and made a few games, which he mentions were most likely awful. His game was an infinite runner with a robot. It taught him the basics like loops and storing variables.In his class he realized that as long as he understood some of the key concepts, he would be able to handle it.Soon he went out and just bought a book and after experiencing the code in action he got hooked.</p>\n\n<h4>Managing memory in C</h4>\n\n<p>Danny&rsquo;s friend tried to teach him how to build a checkers game in C. He remembers the pains of manually managing memory. His feedback on <code>malloc</code> is that it&rsquo;s one of his favorite words because it rolls off the tongue. Charles talks about how in college he had to design systems in VSDL with transistors and silicon.</p>\n\n<h4>How do you get from that to JavaScript Development</h4>\n\n<p>First job was at a swimming pool manufacturing company&rsquo;s marketing department in West Virginia. He worked a lot in Dreamweaver until a man that started after him decided they were going to write all the markup and CSS by hand. From that Danny learned how websites were put together. He talks about a contact form that they wanted to animate. He knew that he could figure it out. He would use code snippets to figure out and build the animation. He started to do more and more JavaScript and teaching himself as much as he could. He did the <a href=\"http://javascript-roadtrip.codeschool.com/levels/1\">CodeSchool JavaScript Road Trip</a>. The first few episodes ease you into JavaScript and helps you learn where things lives. From that point he became obsessed with building things with JavaScript. Charles talks about how CodeSchool wasn&rsquo;t around when he started. Modern code seem to be more complicated but it can be learned best by breaking it down into smaller bites. CodeSchool is good for that. Getting your start or foothold is the hardest part.</p>\n\n<h4>It&rsquo;s easy to skip over fundamentals.</h4>\n\n<p>Charles talks about how that things like CLI came second nature for him and sometimes instructors dismiss that new students may get hung up on those sort of fundamental concepts and tools. Danny adds that there had been times where he would read articles on sites like <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com\">StackOverflow</a> that would be explaining something but even the baseline instructions has information in it that can something someone has skipped. Little pieces of information can really help pull things together. He talks about the dissociation that can happen for someone who only learned JavaScript and doesn&rsquo;t know what CLI is and how hard it would be to explain the difference between JavaScript running in the browser and Node, or explaining what a package manager is, then a package , etc. Many people come into it not understanding any of it. He can remember copying commands into a terminal but not understanding what was going on.</p>\n\n<h4>For learning JavaScript from a basic level, what do you suggest?</h4>\n\n<p>Finding the beginner tutorials for stuff. CodeSchool is good, <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn\">Code Academy</a> as well. Do those first. Don&rsquo;t skip it assuming you know too much to do them. After that just make something. From there you will figure out stuff that works and stuff that doesn&rsquo;t. Twitter is a great resource for finding helpful people. Being in the environment helps to get exposed to the information. Mainly just write code. Charles mentions that people have grown to understand the concepts and lingo of web development by just listening. Danny also advises that if you learn the vocabulary before learning the concepts, you&rsquo;ll be able to do things like Google your issues affectively as well as reading articles or talking with others. Complicated concepts end up be boiled down to single words. Ultimately you will need to be able to communicate with everyone on projects anyway.</p>\n\n<h4>How did you get into Angular?</h4>\n\n<p>While working at DualLink Digital, they started looking at a few different things, he started looking at <a href=\"https://emberjs.com/\">Ember</a> and found that he really enjoyed the concepts. One of his friends started messing around with angular and they started workshopping with it to make it work. Afterwards he started to like it, really the plain JavaScript objects. The more he worked with he, the more he started enjoying it compared to Ember. It&rsquo;s interesting to see how people have moved from <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org\">Backbone</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs\">React</a> or Ember to things like Angular. One of Embers pluses is how large their community is. Charles talks about how the history of Ember is great and the people behind Ember are great. Also, the JavaScript community used to seem to have animosity against the different communities but now it&rsquo;s more collaborative.</p>\n\n<h4>Picking the right framework.</h4>\n\n<p>Danny suggests that when trying to figure out what framework to go with, be able to describe in your own words why the framework you&rsquo;ve picked is better. Making sure that you do understand the decisions that you are making is important. He uses the example of within the React community and the use of virtual DOM. There was a common misconception that the virtual DOM was faster than the regular DOM, which is just not true. Later the details had to be expressed to clear the misunderstanding. If you don&rsquo;t talk about the specifics, you may believe something without knowing the facts behind it. Charles adds that its sort of like politics in that way.</p>\n\n<h4>Tell us the work you&rsquo;ve done with Web Standards.</h4>\n\n<p>Danny talks about getting interested in web components through his friend Eric and actually interviewed at the company Eric worked at. He didn&rsquo;t get the job but they stayed in touch and Eric introduced him into <a href=\"https://www.polymer-project.org/\">Polymer</a>. He started to learn about Polymer, specifically custom elements. He remembers very early on wanting to make a custom HTML tag. He suggests that being able to do things without the framework has been a piece that has been missing. Having lower level building blocks to build off of is really exciting to Danny. He talks about using custom elements to build a familiar API surface to interact with. He talks about an example where he wrapped a bunch of HTML APIs, like the notification API and the fullscreen API, wrapping another element within it. He was trying to build things that the younger version of himself could use. He things that could be something we are heading towards more often. Danny adds that Web Components come with 4 major parts: Custom elements, HTML Imports (kind of), ShadowDOM, and templates. Custom elements allow you to create a unique piece of HTML and is the most widely accepted and supported.</p>\n\n<h4>What are you working on now?</h4>\n\n<p>Danny talks about how the Angular&rsquo;s component model is very similar to Custom Element component model. Where you pass information in through properties and you listen for changes through events. You can use Custom Elements with very little setup. There is a specific Custom Elements Scheme that will let you use custom elements without any properties being thrown. You use the custom event in the exact same way and syntax as for any other component. The one issue with the source code where it parses the metadata, losing the friendly compiler messages out of the box. He is playing around with trying to find a way to whitelist different element names and properties. He wants to learn how the Framework is parsing potential data and make it easy to whitelist a set of custom elements.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3>Picks</h3>\n<h4>Dannys</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/DAEMON-Daniel-Suarez/dp/0451228731/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498483944&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=daniel+suarez\">Daemon by Daniel Suarez</a><br />\nBob&rsquo;s Burgers<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/\">CodeSchool</a></p>\n\n<h4>Charles</h4>\n\n<p>VR &amp; Augmented Reality<br />\nIoT<br />\nArtificial Intelligence<br />\n<a href=\"http://veritone.com\">Veritone.com</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271\">Coursera on Artificial Intelligence</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Python-Prateek-Joshi/dp/178646439X\">Artificial Intelligence with Python</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Absolute-Beginners-Introduction/dp/152095140X\">Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dee_bloo\">Twitter</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@dee_bloo\">Blog on Medium</a></p>\n\n<hr /> \n",

He can remember copying commands into a terminal but not understanding what was going on.\nFor learning JavaScript from a basic level, what do you suggest?\nFinding the beginner tutorials for stuff. CodeSchool is good, Code Academy as well. Do those first. Don\u2019t skip it assuming you know too much to do them. After that just make something. From there you will figure out stuff that works and stuff that doesn\u2019t. Twitter is a great resource for finding helpful people. Being in the environment helps to get exposed to the information. Mainly just write code. Charles mentions that people have grown to understand the concepts and lingo of web development by just listening. Danny also advises that if you learn the vocabulary before learning the concepts, you\u2019ll be able to do things like Google your issues affectively as well as reading articles or talking with others. Complicated concepts end up be boiled down to single words. Ultimately you will need to be able to communicate with everyone on projects anyway.\nHow did you get into Angular?\nWhile working at DualLink Digital, they started looking at a few different things, he started looking at Ember and found that he really enjoyed the concepts. One of his friends started messing around with angular and they started workshopping with it to make it work. Afterwards he started to like it, really the plain JavaScript objects. The more he worked with he, the more he started enjoying it compared to Ember. It\u2019s interesting to see how people have moved from Backbone or React or Ember to things like Angular. One of Embers pluses is how large their community is. Charles talks about how the history of Ember is great and the people behind Ember are great. Also, the JavaScript community used to seem to have animosity against the different communities but now it\u2019s more collaborative.\nPicking the right framework.\nDanny suggests that when trying to figure out what framework to go with, be able to describe in your own words why the framework you\u2019ve picked is better. Making sure that you do understand the decisions that you are making is important. He uses the example of within the React community and the use of virtual DOM. There was a common misconception that the virtual DOM was faster than the regular DOM, which is just not true. Later the details had to be expressed to clear the misunderstanding. If you don\u2019t talk about the specifics, you may believe something without knowing the facts behind it. Charles adds that its sort of like politics in that way.\nTell us the work you\u2019ve done with Web Standards.\nDanny talks about getting interested in web components through his friend Eric and actually interviewed at the company Eric worked at. He didn\u2019t get the job but they stayed in touch and Eric introduced him into Polymer. He started to learn about Polymer, specifically custom elements. He remembers very early on wanting to make a custom HTML tag. He suggests that being able to do things without the framework has been a piece that has been missing. Having lower level building blocks to build off of is really exciting to Danny. He talks about using custom elements to build a familiar API surface to interact with. He talks about an example where he wrapped a bunch of HTML APIs, like the notification API and the fullscreen API, wrapping another element within it. He was trying to build things that the younger version of himself could use. He things that could be something we are heading towards more often. Danny adds that Web Components come with 4 major parts: Custom elements, HTML Imports (kind of), ShadowDOM, and templates. Custom elements allow you to create a unique piece of HTML and is the most widely accepted and supported.\nWhat are you working on now?\nDanny talks about how the Angular\u2019s component model is very similar to Custom Element component model. Where you pass information in through properties and you listen for changes through events. You can use Custom Elements with very little setup. There is a specific Custom Elements Scheme that will let you use custom elements without any properties being thrown. You use the custom event in the exact same way and syntax as for any other component. The one issue with the source code where it parses the metadata, losing the friendly compiler messages out of the box.

Danny is a Google Developer Expert for web technologies. In this episode we hear the story about how Danny first started coding, a method suggestion for picking a frameworks, and how vocabulary is vital for a new programmer to learn. It&rsquo;s a good one, stay tuned.</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<h4>How did you get into programming?</h4>\n\n<p>Didn&rsquo;t get started until college. In school he was under the impression that you had to be a math genius to be a programmer. Didn&rsquo;t even try until college. He wish he would have taken more in College. His first dive into code was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript\">ActionScript 2</a>. He was offered a class that taught how to make Flash games and he took the class and made a few games, which he mentions were most likely awful. His game was an infinite runner with a robot. It taught him the basics like loops and storing variables.In his class he realized that as long as he understood some of the key concepts, he would be able to handle it.Soon he went out and just bought a book and after experiencing the code in action he got hooked.</p>\n\n<h4>Managing memory in C</h4>\n\n<p>Danny&rsquo;s friend tried to teach him how to build a checkers game in C. He remembers the pains of manually managing memory. His feedback on <code>malloc</code> is that it&rsquo;s one of his favorite words because it rolls off the tongue. Charles talks about how in college he had to design systems in VSDL with transistors and silicon.</p>\n\n<h4>How do you get from that to JavaScript Development</h4>\n\n<p>First job was at a swimming pool manufacturing company&rsquo;s marketing department in West Virginia. He worked a lot in Dreamweaver until a man that started after him decided they were going to write all the markup and CSS by hand. From that Danny learned how websites were put together. He talks about a contact form that they wanted to animate. He knew that he could figure it out. He would use code snippets to figure out and build the animation. He started to do more and more JavaScript and teaching himself as much as he could. He did the <a href=\"http://javascript-roadtrip.codeschool.com/levels/1\">CodeSchool JavaScript Road Trip</a>. The first few episodes ease you into JavaScript and helps you learn where things lives. From that point he became obsessed with building things with JavaScript. Charles talks about how CodeSchool wasn&rsquo;t around when he started. Modern code seem to be more complicated but it can be learned best by breaking it down into smaller bites. CodeSchool is good for that. Getting your start or foothold is the hardest part.</p>\n\n<h4>It&rsquo;s easy to skip over fundamentals.</h4>\n\n<p>Charles talks about how that things like CLI came second nature for him and sometimes instructors dismiss that new students may get hung up on those sort of fundamental concepts and tools. Danny adds that there had been times where he would read articles on sites like <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com\">StackOverflow</a> that would be explaining something but even the baseline instructions has information in it that can something someone has skipped. Little pieces of information can really help pull things together. He talks about the dissociation that can happen for someone who only learned JavaScript and doesn&rsquo;t know what CLI is and how hard it would be to explain the difference between JavaScript running in the browser and Node, or explaining what a package manager is, then a package , etc. Many people come into it not understanding any of it. He can remember copying commands into a terminal but not understanding what was going on.</p>\n\n<h4>For learning JavaScript from a basic level, what do you suggest?</h4>\n\n<p>Finding the beginner tutorials for stuff.

Complicated concepts end up be boiled down to single words. Ultimately you will need to be able to communicate with everyone on projects anyway.</p>\n\n<h4>How did you get into Angular?</h4>\n\n<p>While working at DualLink Digital, they started looking at a few different things, he started looking at <a href=\"https://emberjs.com/\">Ember</a> and found that he really enjoyed the concepts. One of his friends started messing around with angular and they started workshopping with it to make it work. Afterwards he started to like it, really the plain JavaScript objects. The more he worked with he, the more he started enjoying it compared to Ember. It&rsquo;s interesting to see how people have moved from <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org\">Backbone</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs\">React</a> or Ember to things like Angular.

This episode might as well be both, a My Angular Story as well as a My Javascript story. Aaron has worked with us on <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/js-jabber\">JS Jabber</a> and was a panelist for <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular\">Adventures in Angular</a>. You also may know him from <a href=\"https://www.ng-conf.org/\">NG Conf</a>, the original Angular Conference. Stay tune to hear his story!</p>\n\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n\n<p>Before Aaron got involved with Javascript or Angular, he worked as a loan officer, and he wasn&rsquo;t the best at it. Luckily his job exposed him to small bits of SQL. Aaron goes to say that SQL &ldquo;was like speaking English&rdquo;. In 2010 he shifted into development. At the time, most web developers hated Javascript, so anytime they could pin Javascript work on him they would. Aaron loved it.</p>\n\n<h3>College Dropout</h3>\n\n<p>Aaron decided to go to college to learn programing, mainly as a means to an end. His goal was primarily to get a job. After finding the job, he dropped out of classes. Aaron says that he was confused by why he was still in school considering he had the job and at any rate, Aaron had learned how to teach himself. Between <a href=\"http://Stackoverflow.com\">Stack Overflow</a> and podcasts and Youtube, Aaron has all the resources he needed.</p>\n\n<h3>Getting Into Work.</h3>\n\n<p>Aaron talks about his time working with <a href=\"http://www.kynetx.com\">Kynetx</a>, writing a language called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_Rule_Language\">Kynetx Rule Language</a>. Kynetx was a platform where developers could create web browser plugins and it would work across the platforms. Aaron talks about the lack of frameworks then, leaving mainly only jQuery.</p>\n\n<h3>And Then, Angular&hellip;</h3>\n\n<p>In one of the corporations Aaron worked for, they used a framework called <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone</a>. Five Hundred programmers all prescribed Backbone for their work, but Aaron nudged someone in the stack team to look into Angular. It was a no brainer, Angular allowed to get the job done in much less code. They adopted it and got proficient.</p>\n\n<h3>Conferences &ldquo;Oyee! We should make one!&rdquo;</h3>\n\n<p>Aaron and Kipp Laurence decided that after they were unable to find an Angular conference to goto online that &ldquo;Oyee! We should make one!&rdquo; Reluctantly Aaron agreed and afterwards had someone from Google on board to send a whole team to the conference.</p>\n\n<h3>Google Developers Experts</h3>\n\n<p>Aaron is a GDE. He talks a bit about what that process what like and how it&rsquo;s changed. He talks about what Google looks for in a GDE and clears any misconception that a GDE is about people who contribute to the community and are natural evangelists.</p>\n\n<h3>Aaron vs Captchas</h3>\n\n<p>Aaron talks about how one of his first projects will always be his favorite. His brother worked in real estate and used a particular website for work. The website had an annoying Captcha that had to be filled out pretty frequently. His brother asked Aaron to attempt to create a way to bypass the Captchas. Aaron talks about how at first he thought it was impossible, but after contemplating using a canvas and some basic calculations, he was able to put together a web browser extension to handle the task. They marketed the tool to others that used the website.</p>\n\n<h3>What He Has Learned</h3>\n\n<p>Aaron says that there is a theme that is reoccurring for him. Aaron talks about how often programmers and developers spend their efforts &ldquo;chasing the pendulum&rdquo; instead of focusing on solving the issues that the company needs them to solve. Programmers should worry less with how cool their patterns are or if they are using the latest Frameworks, and more about getting the job done.</p>\n\n<h3>Keeping Up</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JS_Dev\">Aaron&rsquo;s Twitter</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@frosty\">Aaron&rsquo;s Medium</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/aaronfrost\">Aaron&rsquo;s GitHub</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/aaronfrost/ama\">Aaron&rsquo;s AMA</a></p>\n\n<h3>Picks</h3>\n\n<h4>Aaron</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/superpowereds/\">Superpowereds</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/\">Yarn</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/\">Samsung SmartThings</a></p>\n\n<h4>Charles</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nimble.com/\">Nimble</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://bluetick.io/\">BlueTick</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://build.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Build</a></p>\n \n",

After finding the job, he dropped out of classes. Aaron says that he was confused by why he was still in school considering he had the job and at any rate, Aaron had learned how to teach himself.

His brother worked in real estate and used a particular website for work. The website had an annoying Captcha that had to be filled out pretty frequently. His brother asked Aaron to attempt to create a way to bypass the Captchas.
