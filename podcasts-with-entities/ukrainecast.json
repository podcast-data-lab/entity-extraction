Sam de Bendern, a political risks consultant and former NATO Ukraine officer, explains how Putin is feeling the pressure to celebrate a significant \u2018victory\u2019 in Ukraine on that day.

Meanwhile as fighting continues in the streets across Ukraine\u2019s biggest cities, President Zelensky says his delegation will meet with Russia at the Belarus border for talks.\n\nIs President Putin using his nuclear arsenal as a conflict deterrent or as a threat to the West? Victoria and Gabriel are joined by the director of the International Security Programme at Chatham House, Dr Patricia Lewis.\n\nAnd as hundreds of thousands flee Ukraine, we hear from Newsnight\u2019s Lewis Goodall from the border in Poland, where he\u2019s been speaking to families trying to make their way to safety.\n\nThis episode of Ukrainecast was made by Daniel Wittenberg with Phil Marzouk and Caitlin Hanrahan. The studio manager was Stephen Bailey. The editor is Jonathan Aspinwall."
