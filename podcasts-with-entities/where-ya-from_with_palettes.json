                "summary": "Jonathan Coulton and Sara talk about how she has a crush on John Mayer and then Jonathan pretends to be John Mayer; why she wouldn't listen to Jonathan's stuff for a decade and then became a fan in three hours; how we create a persona to hide our terror of not being cool enough; how he loved growing up in Colchester, CT; how he realized his childhood dream of being in the Whiffenpoofs at Yale; how he once impressed a lady by buying Chinese takeout and taking her to a covered bridge; and whether or not he and Sara ate lamb on a stick together. Also, we meet the imaginary hot intern, Daniel, who is majoring in everything at NYU and all the Ivies.
