                "summary": "When Ross Showalter turned 18 and began dating hearing men, he found himself communicating with them on their terms: using spoken language. Years of speech lessons and lip-reading practice forced Ross, who is Deaf, to conform to a society that favors sound. All of these men made the same promise: to learn sign language, only to never follow through. Then, on a spring day in the midst of the pandemic, Ross met Will. Will vowed to shatter the pattern of false promises that had haunted Ross\u2019s dating life.\n\nToday, we invite you to carefully listen to Ross\u2019s story, read by the Deaf actor Joshua Castille. Then, stick around to hear host Anna Martin catch up with Ross. Ross explains why it\u2019s so powerful for him to communicate in his own language \u2014 American Sign Language \u2014 and he shares an update on him and Will.\n\nTo access a transcript of this episode, visit nytimes.com/mlpodcast."

He had been diagnosed with a cancer that had metastasized to his bones, and he wanted to spend the time he had left with Judah, their young son. Victoria had to make a complicated decision: to forgive her ex and allow him into Judah\u2019s life, or to close the door on Judah\u2019s relationship with his father, possibly forever.\n\nOn our season finale, we listen to Victoria\u2019s story about forgiveness. Then, our host, Anna Martin, checks in with Judah, who is now 16. Judah reflects on what he remembers about his father \u2014 and the impact of the choice his mother made years ago.\n\nThis is our last episode of the summer.
