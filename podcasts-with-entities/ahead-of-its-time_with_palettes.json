    "description": "The inventor of facial recognition software was years ahead of the competition but never got credit for his work because it was kept secret by the CIA. The first VR glove was a groundbreaking piece of tech that would eventually become one of the gaming industry's biggest flops. And when Kodak execs were shown an early prototype of the first digital camera, they flat out rejected the idea. \n\nIn each episode of Ahead of Its Time, you'll explore the forgotten origins of today\u2019s most transformative technology, hear from the people who first imagined it, delve into their past and relive their eureka moments. \n\nJoin host, podcast producer and queen of tech storytelling Julia Furlan to discover why these inventors struggled to get their ideas off the ground. Then meet the next generation of innovators who are building on the work of the tech underdogs who came before them.",

                "summary": "In an age where gas-powered vehicles account for nearly half of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, electric vehicles are a way to help slow global warming. Over the last decade, the EV industry grew by leaps and bounds and Tesla has arguably done more for the industry than any other company. But the next big thing for EVs\u2026 might be making them smaller. \n\nIn this episode, Wally Rippel remembers gazing out his classroom window at the air pollution hanging over LA one smoggy day and how that led to building what would become GM\u2019s infamous EV1. Then Wim Ouboter recalls how his homemade push scooter started a chain of events that inspired him to build a miniature electric bubble car named the Microlino."

The technology\u2019s potential captured imaginations and even helped power the first satellites launched into space. But applications here on earth proved harder to find.\nBut Bob Freling found a terrestrial application that\u2019s making an outsized impact. Bob, working with the Solar Electric Light Fund (SELF), has helped more than 1-million people around the\u00a0 world who can\u2019t access the electrical grid use solar to do a lot more than turn on the lights. His story takes us to the African country of Benin where local farmers are using solar power to fight drought and increase food security.\nFor more information, visit setapp.com/podcast\nPlease Take Our Listener Survey!!\nWe want to hear from you! \u00a0We\u2019re asking listeners to complete a short 5 minute survey so we can understand what you liked about the show and how we can make it even better. \u00a0\nTo take the survey please visit stpp.co/survey.\nOnce you complete the survey, you\u2019ll be entered into a draw for a chance to win one of five Apple gift cards each worth $100.
