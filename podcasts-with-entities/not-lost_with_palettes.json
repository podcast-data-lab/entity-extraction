    "description": "<p>When both his popular culture podcast and long-term relationship come to an end, journalist Brendan finds he has the time &mdash; and freedom &mdash; to pursue his dream: a travel podcast where he goes places and learns about them by getting invited to a stranger&rsquo;s house for dinner. A friend joins him at each destination and they drink, dance, and eat their way from Montr&eacute;al to Mexico City, often learning as much about themselves as the place they&rsquo;re visiting. Not Lost is both a delightful travel escape and an insightful look at people &mdash; locals and visitors alike &mdash; trying to make sense of a constantly changing world.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Not Lost is a co-production of Pushkin Industries, Topic Studios and iHeartMedia. </em><em>iHeart Media is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries.</em></p>",
