With Christopher Nolan\u2019s biopic of the father of the atomic bomb J. Robert Oppenheimer on its way and anxieties about Putin\u2019s nuclear arsenal in the air, Ian Dunt and Dorian Lynskey take us through how the human race learned to live with the first weapon that could potentially spell global annihilation.\n\nFrom the invention of the atomic bomb in a novel by HG Wells to the triumph of the Manhattan Project and the horror of Hiroshima, a modern Pandora\u2019s Box opens. Einstein calls his role in the story his \u201cone great mistake\u201d, Oppenheimer says he has blood on his hands, and an anxious world wonders if it will be blown up tomorrow.\n\nThis one has the lot: fear, guilt, paranoia and a glimpse of the end of the world.\n\nListen to Part 2 right now when you support Origin Story on Patreon: www.Patreon.com/originstorypod\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a weapon.

Who could believe such a thing? Ian Dunt and Dorian Lynskey track the ultimate heresy from the earliest days of western civilisation to the freethinkers of the Enlightenment and the bare-knuckle oratory of the New Atheists.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between atheism, agnosticism, secularism and deism? What does it stand for? Can it explain the world while also satisfying the need for meaning and community? Was totalitarianism the monstrous zenith of atheism or just a substitute religion?\nThomas Paine, Bertrand Russell, Percy Shelley, Albert Camus, Richard Dawkins and more feature in the story of the fight for the right not to believe in God.\nListen to next week\u2019s episode right now when you support Origin Story on Patreon: www.Patreon.com/originstorypod\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cEvery day around the world it is incalculable the amount of damage done by religions saying; you can\u2019t go there, you can\u2019t marry them, you can\u2019t say that.\u201d \u2013 Ian Dunt\n\n\n\n\u201cDeclaring oneself an atheist is still a bold claim.\u201d \u2013 Dorian Lynskey\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a humbling experience to think it\u2019s taken us 1,500 years to get back to the position we were in in 300AD.\u201d \u2013 Ian Dunt\n\n\n\nReading List:\u00a0\u00a0\nJulian Baggini \u2013 Atheism: A Very Short Introduction\u00a0\nDavid Berman \u2013 A History of Atheism in Britain: From Hobbes to Russell\u00a0\nAlbert Camus \u2013 The Myth of Sisyphus\u00a0\nJohn Gray \u2013 Seven Types of Atheism\u00a0\nChristopher Hitchens \u2013 God Is Not Great\u00a0\nChristopher Hitchens (ed.) \u2013 The Portable Atheist\u00a0\nSusan Jacoby \u2013 Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism\u00a0\nPercy Bysshe Shelley \u2013 The Necessity of Atheism\u00a0\nJames Thrower \u2013 A Short History of Western Atheism\u00a0\nTim Whitmarsh \u2013 Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World\nRichard Dawkins \u2013 The God Delusion\n\nWritten and presented by Dorian Lynskey and Ian Dunt.

And what are Erykah Badu, Piers Morgan, the weaponisation of African-American slang against black people, Julie Burchill and Google\u2019s salad emoji doing in the eye of the Culture War storm?\u00a0\nIan and Dorian investigate another world-changing concept you thought you knew.\u00a0\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nWoke: A Reading List\nFrom Dorian:\nThe War of the Words by Sarah Dunant. Fascinating 90s collection of essays about political correctness from writers across the political spectrum. We are still having many of the same arguments.\nDebating PC by Paul Berman. As above but American.\nPolitical Correctness: A History of Semantics and Culture by Geoffrey Hughes. A serious attempt at a history of PC.\nThe Culture of Complaint by Robert Hughes. Extremely opinionated and entertaining 1994 polemic against censors and heresy-hunters on both left and right.\nThe Myth of Political Correctness by John Wilson. This forensic examination of the original anti-PC backlash reveals how many of the key case studies were exaggerated or invented, and the role that right wing think tanks played in drumming them up. Sounds familiar.\nThe Closing of the American Mind by Allan Bloom. Of historical interest only. The cranky jeremiad that became a colossal bestseller and kickstarted America\u2019s obsession with political correctness.\nAnd from Ian:\nWake Up by Piers Morgan. Don\u2019t read this.\nWelcome To The Woke Trials: How Identity Killed Progressive Politics by Julie Burchill.\u00a0Don\u2019t read this.\nThe Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure by Jonathan Heidt and Greg Lukianoff. Don\u2019t read this, but if you\u2019re really going to insist on reading one of these, I guess make it this one.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\u201cEven racists seem to want to appropriate MLK.
