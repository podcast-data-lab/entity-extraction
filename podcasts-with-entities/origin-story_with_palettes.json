            "content": "This week, Ian Dunt and Dorian Lynskey get started on the history of eugenics, the idea of finding biological solutions to social problems. Say the word now and it calls to mind skull-measuring cranks or Nazi death camps but for decades it was a mainstream project in many parts of the world, attracting not just white supremacists and elitist snobs but liberals, socialists and feminists. Winston Churchill, HG Wells, Nikola Tesla and John Maynard Keynes all expressed an interest. How did bad science and dangerous politics become so popular?\nDorian and Ian explore how Francis Galton and Herbert Spencer\u2019s fascination with inherited characteristics was supercharged by Victorian science, from Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution to early breakthroughs in genetics.

            "content": "Born in Haitian folklore and inadvertently reinvented by director George A. Romero, the zombie is the most flexible metaphor in horror fiction, if not all of popular culture. It can represent a war, a virus, a natural disaster, terrorism, capitalism, climate change and much more. In fact, it\u2019s hard to tell a zombie story that isn\u2019t political in one way or another.\nIan Dunt and\u00a0Dorian Lynskey follow the trail of the walking dead from the Caribbean to Night of the Living Dead and the global outbreak of zombiemania in the 21st century.

Ian Dunt and Dorian Lynskey dig into his two megasellers, 12 Rules for Life and Beyond Order, and try to understand why these very strange cocktails of self-help advice, comparative mythology and biological essentialism resonated with millions of readers, especially men and boys.\u00a0\nDo his ideas add up to a coherent view of how to live? How does he reconcile mythology with zoology? What on earth is \u201cpostmodern neo-Marxism\u201d? And what is it with Peterson and Pinocchio?\u00a0\nDorian and Ian discuss how the man with so many rules for life wound up at the end of his tether in a Russian hospital, and how to reconcile his books with his increasingly eccentric and extreme social media presence.

How does it work? What distinguishes it from bullying? Does it even have to be funny? Ian Dunt and Dorian Lynskey go in search of the truth of satire on a journey that takes in The Thick Of It, Basil Fawlty, Jonathan Swift, Succession, Lenny Bruce, trickster gods, Boris Johnson, Peter Cook and Beyond The Fringe, Spitting Image and more\u2026\u00a0all the way back to the origin\u00a01.4 million years ago of laughter itself.\nHelp Ian and Dorian develop Origin Story by backing us on Patreon.

And it solves nothing, as tears do.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Kurt Vonnegut\n\n\n\n\u201cAudiences like to think satire is doing something but mostly it\u2019s making them satisfied \u2013\u00a0rather than angry, which is what they should be.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Tom Lehrer\n\n\n\nPicture: The Thick Of It, BBC\nWritten and presented by Dorian Lynskey and Ian Dunt.

In the final episode of Series 1, Dorian and Ian tell the extraordinary story of how a friendless group of outsider economists started a decades-long campaign to turn their fringe ideas into mainstream orthodoxy \u2013\u00a0and succeeded.\u00a0\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nNeoliberalism: A Reading List\nFrom Ian:\nWealth of Nations and Theory of Moral Sentiment by Adam Smith. Both of these can be read in their own right, they're not as tough-going as you think\nHistory of Economic Thought by Lionel Robbins. One of the greatest economics books ever written. Or spoken rather, given that they're basically transcripts of Robbins\u2019 lectures at the LSE. Masterful.\u00a0\nThe Road to Serfdom by F.A. Hayek. Quite completely insane. Rather fun.\nCrashed: How a Decade of Financial Crisis Changed the World by Adam Tooze. Arguably the best single account of the financial crash. Can be tough going, but it\u2019s worth it.\nFrom Dorian:\nMasters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics by Daniel Stedman Jones. It gets a little dry towards the end but it\u2019s still a valuable attempt to ground an intellectual history of a movement in the combative personalities of the people who created it.\nA Brief History of Neoliberalism by David Harvey. Does what it says on the tin from a left-wing perspective. He\u2019s not a fan.\nThe Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein. Her thesis\u00a0might be overstated but Klein shows how the economists of the Chicago School teamed up with authoritarian leaders such as Pinochet to turn\u00a0entire countries into experimental laboratories for neoliberalism.\nA reading\u00a0list and whistle-stop history from the academic and author of The\u00a0Limits of Neoliberalism, William Davies.\u00a0\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\u201cWhat you see here is the fetishisation of economics above all other concerns. An anatomised view of humanity as economic agents and very little else.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Ian\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the big problems with the term neoliberalism is that it gets applied equally to Barack Obama and General Pinochet.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Dorian\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cFriedman didn\u2019t even believe in certificates for doctors. He thought the market would protect everyone. So this guy chopped up your auntie? That\u2019s OK, the market realises he should no longer practice\u2026\u201d \u2013\u00a0Ian\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThese guys embarked on a 20 year process of legitimising these ideas. They trained people so that when things start to go wrong in the late 60s, they were ready.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Dorian\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cSometimes Hayek sounds like he\u2019s having a religious experience. The market is unknowable. It\u2019s almost like it really is the hand of God.\u201d \u2013 Ian\u00a0\n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nWritten and presented by Dorian Lynskey and Ian Dunt.

Ian and Dorian chart the rise of the tinfoil mindset in a wild historical ride that takes in the Illuminati, 9/11, Karl Popper, Watergate, Hitler, QAnon, Oliver Stone\u2019s JFK, and Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn\u2019s secret society.\nAnd chillingly, they explain why the tinfoil fringe isn\u2019t just on the fringe any more.\u00a0\nHelp Ian and Dorian DO THEIR RESEARCH by supporting Origin Story on Patreon:\u00a0www.Patreon.com/originstorypod\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nConspiracy Theory: A Reading List\nFrom Dorian:\nVoodoo Histories by David Aaronovitch. Sharp and readable overview of the history and psychology of conspiracy theories.\nThe United States of Paranoia by Jesse Walker. A provocative history which argues that paranoia permeates mainstream American politics, not just the fringes.\nAmong the Truthers by Jonathan Kay. A reporter\u2019s journey through contemporary conspiracy theories.\nThe Paranoid Style in American Politics by Richard Hofstadter. This brilliant diagnosis of the conspiracist mentality still holds up.\nThe Hitler Conspiracies by Richard J Evans. Evans uses case studies including the Reichstag fire and the stab-in-the-back myth to illustrate the importance of conspiracy theories to the Nazi era. Very good on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the difference between event theories and systemic theories.\nThe Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon. The classic novel of American paranoia and the only Pynchon novel you can read in less than a week.\nThe Coming Storm. Superbly reported BBC podcast series, presented by Gabriel Gatehouse, explores the 90s roots of QAnon.\nOn JFK the movie:\nJFK: The Book of the Film by Oliver Stone and Zachary Sklar. The heavily annotated screenplay plus reams of press coverage of Stone\u2019s movie, much of it hostile.\nReclaiming History by Vincent Bugliosi. Elephantine takedown of every single JFK conspiracy theory.
