    "description": "In our pursuit of a happy life, we build, we structure, and we plan. Often, we follow conventional wisdom and strategize. But what happens when our plans fall through and expectations don\u2019t meet reality\u2014when the things that should make us happy don\u2019t?\u00a0\nIn season 3 of our How To series, Atlantic happiness correspondent Arthur Brooks and producer Rebecca Rashid seek to navigate the unexpected curves on the path to personal happiness\u2014with data-driven insights and a healthy dose of introspection.\nThis series was produced by Rebecca Rashid and hosted by Arthur Brooks. Editing by A.C. Valdez and Claudine Ebeid. Fact-check by Ena Alvarado. Engineering by Matthew Simonson.

What if the secret to happiness at work has less to do with our extrinsic motivations\u2014money, rewards, and personal gain\u2014and more to do with our intrinsic motivations\u2014the meaningful relationships we build, and the ability to be in service to those who need it?\nIn this episode of How to Build a Happy Life, we\u2019ll explore workplace practices to live out purpose-driven principles. We\u2019ll also talk about why authenticity is vital to strong leadership and \u201cwalking the talk,\u201d and how to factor emotional needs into our workplaces. A conversation with Chief Happiness Officer and CEO of Delivering Happiness, Jenn Lim, helps us tackle one big question at work: Why do I do this everyday?\nThis episode was produced by Rebecca Rashid and hosted by Arthur Brooks.

But what happens when our plans fall through and expectations don\u2019t meet reality\u2014when the things that should make us happy don\u2019t?\u00a0\nIn season 3 of our How To series, Atlantic happiness correspondent Arthur Brooks and producer Rebecca Rashid seek to navigate the unexpected curves on the path to personal happiness\u2014with data-driven insights and a healthy dose of introspection.\nThis series was produced by Rebecca Rashid and hosted by Arthur Brooks. Editing by A.C. Valdez and Claudine Ebeid. Fact-check by Ena Alvarado. Engineering by Matthew Simonson.
