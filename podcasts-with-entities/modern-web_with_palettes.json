Stephen also shares with us the idea of smart contracts, and how they play into our ecosystem of development. This episode will also teach you what programming language to use, and why and how it is for you as a JS developer to get going with an IDE today.

They talk about what\u2019s next after Lighthouse in a developer\u2019s web performance journey, other tools such as Microsoft's webhint, and the new core web vitals that Google has recently published. Plus, they explore the importance (or lack thereof these days) of PWAs and how that is changing on mobile platforms.</p>\r\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>Guest:</p>\r\n\n<p>Maximiliano Firtman (@firt) - Freelance Mobile+Web developer | Author, Speaker, & Trainer\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>Hosts:</p>\r\n\n<p>Tracy Lee (@ladyleet) - CEO, This Dot Labs</p>\r\n\n<p>Ben Lesh (@benlesh) - Software Engineer at Citadel & Author of RxJS</p>\r\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>This episode is sponsored by\u00a0<a href='https://labs.thisdot.co/'>This Dot Labs</a>.\u00a0</p>\r\n"

We\u2019re joined by Rob Dodson, developer advocate at Google, and Alice Boxhall, software engineer at Google. We talk about why accessibility matters to everyone, even beyond people with disabilities. We dive into the implementation details, such as navigation, semantics and styling, based on Rob and Alice\u2019s Web Accessibility course.
