However, sent to study at a military academy in France, the future Emperor would begin to shed his Corsican roots, and start to embrace more revolutionary, universalist ideals... Join Tom and Dominic in the first part of our series on Young Napoleon, as they discuss the tumultuous island he grew up on, his enthusiasm for the French Revolution, the effect on him of his military schooling, and his complicated relationship with France.\n\n*The Rest Is History Live Tour 2023*:\n\nTom and Dominic are back on tour this autumn!

                "summary": "\u201cAmerica, late the strength, now the foe to Britain, dismembered, torn, I fear forever lost to England, whence she sprung.\u201d\nThe American Revolution came about due to growing tensions between the American colonies and Great Britain, primarily over issues of taxation and representation. It led to the birth of the United States of America, established upon Enlightenment principles of liberal democracy and constitutionalism. In the first episode of our four part series, Tom and Dominic are joined by Professor Adam Smith for a detailed look at the beginnings of the American Revolution, as they examine the background to the war, and how both religious fervour and the implementation of colonial taxes fuelled the conflict.\u00a0\n\nThe Rest Is History Club members can listen to the full series now.\n\nJoin The Rest Is History Club on Apple podcasts or at www.restishistorypod.com for ad-free listening to the full archive, weekly bonus episodes, live streamed shows, and access to an exclusive chatroom community.\n\n*The Rest Is History Live Tour 2023*:\n\nTom and Dominic are back on tour this autumn!

But with Ulster in uproar, the Tories encouraging mutiny and thousands of rifles pouring into Ireland, is the United Kingdom really heading for a bloody civil war? And was Sarajevo really the turning point that saved Britain from a sectarian inferno?\nIn today's episode, Tom and Dominic are joined by friend of the show Dan Jackson to discuss the thrilling climax to the Home Rule saga, with appearances from characters such as H. H. Asquith, Andrew Bonar Law and Sir Edward Carson.

The country struggled for much of the latter half of the 20th century, relying on economic support and political backing from the USSR, until its dissolution in 1990. But what was life like for the average East German? In today's episode, Tom and Dominic are joined by historian Katja Hoyer as they discuss living standards, police surveillance, access to luxury goods, elections and political unrest in the now defunct East Germany.\n\n*The Rest Is History Live Tour 2023*:\n\nTom and Dominic are back on tour this autumn!
