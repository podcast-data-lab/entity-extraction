In part because randomized trials \u2013 in which you recruit two statistically identical groups, choose one of them to get a treatment, and then compare what happens to each group \u2013 are expensive, and they take a lot of time.<br><br>But then, by chance, Michael had the opportunity to run a randomized trial in Busia, Kenya. He helped a nonprofit test whether the aid they were giving to local schools helped the students. That study paved the way for more randomized trials, and for other economists to use the method. <br><br>On today's show, how Busia, Kenya, became <em>the</em> place where economists pioneered a more scientific way to study huge problems, from contaminated water to low graduation rates, to HIV transmission. And how that research changed government programs and aid efforts around the world. <br><br><em>This episode was produced by James Sneed with help from Willa Rubin.

            "contentSnippet": "Imagine if we built cars the same way we build houses. First, a typical buyer would meet with the car designer, and tell them what kind of car they want. Then the designer would draw up plans for the car.\nThe buyer would call different car builders in their town and show them the blueprints. And the builders might say, \"Yeah, I can build you that car based on this blueprint. It will cost $1 million and it will be ready in a year and a half.\"\nThere are lots of reasons why homes are so expensive in the U.S., zoning and land prices among them. But also, the way we build houses is very slow and very inefficient. So, why don't we build homes the way we build so many other things, by mass producing them in a factory?\nIn this episode, the century-old dream of the factory-built house, and the possibility of a prefab future.\nThis episode was produced by Emma Peaslee.
