                "summary": "1 Samuel 11 explores the inauguration of Saul\u2019s reign as king of Israel. In the previous chapter, the prophet Samuel had given Saul several signs that his anointing was genuine and from the Lord. That validation ended with Samuel\u2019s directive that Saul accompany him to Gilgal to renew the covenant. Saul failed to do this. In this chapter of 1 Samuel, we discover what Saul did instead of going to Gilgal. In one respect, the chapter records Saul\u2019s lone real success as king with a victory over the Ammonites. But in another respect, it again sets the tone for Saul\u2019s unfitness to be king. On a wider, more surprising note, this chapter also seems to reveal a connection back to the serpent of Genesis 3 as part of a motif that Israel\u2019s kings were expected to be fulfillments of the promise of the seed of the woman overcoming the serpent."

But it is often a surprise to note that John specifically informs us that his end of days vision about the new, forever presence of God on earth does not include a new temple (Rev 21:22). What do we make of this absence give the Old Testament expectation of a new temple after the exile of Israel has been completed? This episode focuses on the broad Old Testament context of Rev 21-22 by examining Israelite \u201ctemple consciousness\u201d before and during the exile. How did Israelites think about the concept of \u201ctemple\u201d? How does that help us see what John is trying to communicate?"

In this episode we explore one major difficult for this approach: If, as this approach validates, the \u201ckingdom\u201d and \u201cthousand year\u201d language used in the book actually refer to the present Church Age, how is it that Satan can be said to be \u201cbound\u201d and imprisoned during the present Church Age. This seems absurd and some answers to the question are weak. Listen as we propose a different explanation, one that dovetails beautifully with the Deuteronomy 32 worldview articulated in Dr. Heiser\u2019s The Unseen Realm and Demons books."

In this episode we discuss this topic with Dr. David Mitchell, perhaps the solitary scholar who has brought all the relevant ancient \u201cJosephite Messiah\u201d material together into one book. Dr. Mitchell writes extensively of how Jewish sources such as the Talmud speak of a figure called Messiah ben Joseph, who comes forth from Galilee to die, pierced by his enemies at the gate of Jerusalem, whose death confounds Satan, atones for sin, and abolishes death itself.\u00a0\r\nBooks\r\nDavid C.

Nevertheless, many Gentile believers today wonder whether their love for Yeshua (Jesus) and faithfulness as his followers ought to be expressed by observing the Law. What of Jewish believers in Jesus? Does Acts 15 assume that Jewish believers in Yeshua must be Torah observant? Did not Jesus and Paul teach believers to \u201cdo and observe\u201d the Law? What about New Testament passages that suggest believers are not under the Law, and that the Law became obsolete with the making of the new covenant (Heb. 8: 6\u2013 13)?

The conversation focuses on his important (and highly recommended) book, Reading Moses, Seeing Jesus: How the Torah Fulfills its Goal in Yeshua (co-authored with Eitan Bar and Erez Soref).

Dr. Seth Postell joins us today to answer these and other questions. The conversation focuses on his important (and highly recommended) book, Reading Moses, Seeing Jesus: How the Torah Fulfills its Goal in Yeshua (co-authored with Eitan Bar and Erez Soref). His thesis is straightforward: The purpose of the Torah, Genesis through Deuteronomy, is that it is an historical narrative whose purpose is to lead Israel through the broken Law and beyond, namely, to Yeshua, the Messiah. Dr. Postell is a key leader at One for Israel, a multi-faceted non-profit ministry with the express goal of reaching Israelis and Arabs with the good news of Yeshua.

Contrary to other Christian biologists, whose research in the last twenty years has led some apologetics ministries to deny the historicity of Adam and Eve, Dr. Swamidass argues that a historical Adam and Eve is quite possible and not in conflict with genetic science. His book proposes that the information gleaned from the study of our biology via the tools of science be allowed to tell one story of humanity, a genetic ancestry, while Scripture be allowed to tell its own human story, one that knows only genealogical ancestry. The two stories follow similar trajectories and ultimately entwine, but they are nonetheless different. In Part 1 of our conversation, we learn about Dr. Swamidass and his background, faith, and the path that led to his fascinating book.\n\r\n**Use code NBP40 on IVPress' website to purchase The Genealogical Adam and Eve: The Surprising Science of Universal Ancestry \u00a0and receive a 40% discount and free shipping in the U.S. until 1/15/21.**",

To our surprise we learn that Mary Magdalene failed to recognize the risen Jesus, instead \u201csupposing him to be the gardener\u201d (John 20:15). In this episode of the podcast, we discover that John\u2019s intent in this scene was not to have his readers question Mary\u2019s ignorance or judgment. Rather, the scene draws on a frequent ancient Near Eastern tradition, also present in the Hebrew Bible, that associates kings with gardens and even casts them as gardeners. The garden tomb scene and the identification of Jesus as the \u201cgardener\u201d turns out to be filled with symbolism that presents Jesus as the Davidic messiah-king."

There are many difficulties and issues that have distracted scholars over the years. Exodus 12:37 and Exodus 12:40 are two that we will discuss in this episode. The first confronts us with the problem of large numbers of people in the Exodus narratives. The second takes us into the duration of the sojourn (bondage) of Israel in Egypt, an item made controversial by its apparent disagreement with several other biblical passages.\r\nD. M.

We talk about the reasons the biblical author links his description with Genesis 11:1-9, the Babel story; why the description of the bondage is justifiable historical; how the earlier story of Joseph in Egypt could be congruent with Exod 1:11, and how what pharaoh commanded the Hebrew midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, has been regularly misunderstood."

The discussion centers on introducing you to some popular Bible study apps, walking you through several examples of Greek word studies from Colossians, and finally, a special offer to the Naked Bible audience for video courses designed by Johnny Cisneros.\r\nPart 2: Joe Fioramonti - Anno Domini\r\nJoe Fioramonti is a long-time friend of Mike and the podcast. He\u2019s an artist, a professor, and an entrepreneur. His new business, Anno Domini, designs and hand-produces unique but traditional art prints. One-third of the proceeds goes directly to ministries that focus on persecuted pastors and Christians in dangerous parts of the world."

In this episode we chat with Dr. David de Silva, a recognized expert in this area of Second Temple period / New Testament study. As he wrote in The Dictionary of New Testament Background, \u201cHonor refers to the public acknowledgment of a person\u2019s worth, granted on the basis of how fully that individual embodies qualities and behaviors valued by the group.

Where different cultures with different values existed side by side, it became extremely important to insulate one\u2019s own group members against the desire for honor or avoidance of dishonor in the eyes of outsiders, since only by so doing could one remain wholly committed to the distinctive culture and values of the group.

For example, does referring to Jesus as \u201cfirstborn\u201d suggest that he was created? Does it point to chronology\u2014that Jesus was the first created thing? How is that reconcilable with the \u201cfullness of God\u201d being in Jesus? When verse 20 speaks of \u201call things, whether on earth or in heaven\u201d being reconciled to God through Jesus does that mean that Satan and fallen angels can be\u2014and ultimately will be- forgiven for their sins and redeemed?

Few Old Testament scholars assign any merit to this idea. Why the disagreement? Is there any basis for thinking Job is earlier than the time of Moses?

While the heavenly throne is obvious to the scene, the actual setting often escapes attention.

Scholars have attempted to explain this passage in many ways. Some have suggested that Jesus was speaking figuratively, not speaking of buying literal swords, but alluding to the future persecution of the disciples. Some suggest Jesus was preparing them to take up swords to defend themselves after his departure, preparing them for bandits along the way. Along these lines, still others suggest Jesus was referring more generally to the time of trial to come after his resurrection. This passage has even featured prominently in modern debates regarding Christian positions on guns and violence, some evangelical voices going as far to suggest that Jesus by implication encourages the right to brandish and use fire arms. As such, this text has factored into discussion of Christian ethics. In this episode David Burnett returns to the podcast and offers a new approach, one that reframes the passage through a careful treatment of the text within its wider narrative context and Luke's use of scripture.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Resource:\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://nakedbiblepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/David-A.-Burnett-SBL-Lk-22.35-38-Handout.pdf\">David A.

Some have suggested that Jesus was speaking figuratively, not speaking of buying literal swords, but alluding to the future persecution of the disciples. Some suggest Jesus was preparing them to take up swords to defend themselves after his departure, preparing them for bandits along the way. Along these lines, still others suggest Jesus was referring more generally to the time of trial to come after his resurrection. This passage has even featured prominently in modern debates regarding Christian positions on guns and violence, some evangelical voices going as far to suggest that Jesus by implication encourages the right to brandish and use fire arms. As such, this text has factored into discussion of Christian ethics.

The centrality of not turning from the true gospel of faith in the work of Christ and God\u2019s acceptance of the ministry of his Son \u2013 of continuing in \u201cbelieving loyalty\u201d to the gospel \u2013 is the central focus of the controversial statements in Heb 6:4-6. Does this passage teach that believers can lose salvation or reject salvation? Is there a difference? What about eternal security? This episode focuses on these questions."

                "summary": "In Hebrews 2 the writer continues to focus on the supremacy of Christ to the Law (Torah) and angels. Christ is superior for many reasons, but chiefly because only he, through his sacrificial death, burial, and resurrection could provide the eternal sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins and bring humans back to right relationship with God. As Hebrews 2:1415 say God became a man in Jesus Christ so that, \u201cthrough death he [Jesus] might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.\u201d This statement is followed by another one whose significance is overlooked by many, especially those who mistakenly believe that the offer of salvation through Christ is extended to fallen angels: \u201cFor surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect.\u201d This episode of the podcast focuses on the necessity of the incarnation not only to the superiority of Christ, but to the problematic idea that fallen angels can be forgiven."

Mentioned in only two passages in the Old Testament (Gen 14:17-24; Psalm 110), he nevertheless drew a lot of attention during the Second Temple Period and the New Testament. Thousands of pages of scholarly research have been devoted to him. Nearly everything said about him produces interpretive problems, from the nature of his name, to its meaning, to his identity as a Canaanite (non-Israelite), to why Psalm 110 favors his priesthood about that of Aaron.

The chapter strikes an analogy between the mighty nation of Egypt and a great cedar tree in Eden, the envy of other glorious trees in the garden of God. The symbol of the \u201cworld tree\u201d or \u201ccosmic tree\u201d is well known, not only to scholars of the ancient Near East, but other cultures as well. The cosmic tree represents a mythological pillar or column that unites all elements of Israel\u2019s ancient three-tiered cosmology. Its branches reach the heavens; its trunk is fixed to the earth, while its roots descend into the subterranean deep of Sheol. It gives life to everything living thing yet it intersects with the realm of the dead. As with Ezekiel28, many scholars presume the point of that the great tree is Adam, to whom Pharaoh is being compared and judged for his hubris. This common assumption misses the meaning of the primeval cosmic tree and its associated forest as this episode details.\r\nResources:\r\nSilviu Bunta, \u201cThe ME\u0160U-Tree and the Animal Inside: Theomorphism and Theriomorphism in Daniel 4,\u201d Scrinium 3:1 (2007): 364-384\r\nEdward Lipinski, \u201cEl's Abode: Mythological Traditions Related to Mount Hermon and to the Mountains of Armenia,\u201d Orientalia Lovaniensa Periodica II, (Leuven, 1971), pp. 13-69\r\nEzek31-Hermon-Lebanon-Map"

Dr. Heiser shares the view of other scholars who say that the prince of Tyre is being compared to a divine rebel -- and that this passage is related to another one (Isaiah 14) that compares a human ruler (king of Babylon) to a divine rebel.

The names of the sisters convey the focus well: Israel went into apostasy, and her sister followed her path.

                "summary": "This episode begins a series of topical episodes following the end of our series on Leviticus. The topic for this episode is the controversial head covering reference in 1 Cor. 11:13-15. The discussion summarizes the material discussed in a scholarly journal article published in 2004 by Dr. Troy Martin entitled, \u201cPaul's Argument from Nature for the Veil in 1 Cor. 11:13-15: A Testicle instead of a Head Covering\" (Journal of Biblical Literature 123:1 [2004]: 75-84). Martin summarizes his approach as follows: \u201cThis article interprets Paul's argument from nature in 1 Cor. 11:13-15 against the background of ancient physiology. The Greek and Roman medical texts provide useful information for interpreting not only Paul's letters but also other NT texts.\u201d The article (and the author\u2019s subsequent responses to criticism, also published in academic literature) presents a compelling case and is, to Dr. Heiser\u2019s knowledge, the only approach that provides a coherent explanation as to why the head covering warnings are important, in the words of Paul \u201cbecause of the angels\u201d (1 Cor. 11:10). This warning ultimately takes readers back to the incident with the Watchers (sons of God) in Gen. 6:1-4. One of Martin's concluding application thoughts is also important: \"Since the physiological conceptions of the body have changed, however, no physiological reason remains for continuing the practice of covering women's heads in public worship, and many Christian communities reasonably abandon this practice.\" In other words, Paul's rationale for what he says here is no longer coherent today -- but his teaching points are (modesty, sexual fidelity). As such, wearing veils (in church or elsewhere) is a conscience issue, not a point of doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this material is overtly sexual, so this episode is for adult listeners.\r\nPapers referenced:\r\nPaul's argument from nature for the veil in 1 Corinthians 11.13-15: A Testicle instead of a Head Covering\r\nWhy Should Women Cover their Heads bc of the Angels"

Discussing these things in the context of the OT passages to which Luke alludes helps us see the beginning of an important biblical-theological motif: the \u201calready but not yet\u201d nature of God\u2019s plan for reclaiming the nations and having a human family to rule and reign with him."

The best way to do that is to immerse yourself in the worldview of the civilizations of these eras with which the biblical writers had regular contact.\u00a0 That is accomplished by immersion in the written sources of these civilizations.\u00a0The last episode of the podcast dealt with the need to tap into the written material of the ANE since that is the context for the OT. In this episode we\u2019ll turn attention to the NT context, the Second\u00a0temple period (6th century BC-1st century AD).

            "content": "In this second episode of the series on Bible study, Dr. Heiser discusses what interpreting the Bible \"in context\" really means -- taking the Bible's own primitive context seriously. Rather than filter the Bible through creeds dating from the 17th and 18th centuries, or even the period of early Christianity, the Bible's actual context is the one that produced the biblical books -- the era stretching from the 2nd millennium BC to the first century AD. All other contexts are foreign to the Bible, no matter how persuasive they are in denominational traditions. The student of the Bible must make all foreign contexts subservient to the Bible's own context. That means replacing our own worldview with that of the biblical writer living during this ancient time span in the ancient Near East and eastern Mediterranean.

His context for that thought is the partaking of OT priests in sacrificial meat (though not of the sacrifices for atonement or sin offering), and the demonic \"fellowship\" that is the result of pagan sacrifice. This episode moves into 1 Corinthians 11, where Paul describes the Lord's Supper in relation to a fellowship meal.
