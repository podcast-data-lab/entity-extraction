Join me, Sarah Allely, as I discover how nature helped me recover from a brain injury.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a mild traumatic brain injury left me unable to read, write or watch TV,&nbsp; I discovered my path to recovery was through nature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This podcast follows my journey of recovery, and my quest to find out why. What\u2019s the science behind my experience? Many academics acknowledge nature\u2019s health benefits, and scientists are yet to pinpoint exactly what it is that heals. This series returns to the forests and coastlines to immerse you in the sounds of nature that improved my focus and concentration, relieved my headaches and lifted my depression and anxiety.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
