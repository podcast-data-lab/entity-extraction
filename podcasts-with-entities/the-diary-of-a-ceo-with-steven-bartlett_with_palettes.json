    "description": "A few years ago I was a broke, university dropout, living in a studio-flat in a rough area. At 18 I started a company which would eventually become \"Social Chain\" - an industry leading marketing company. At 26 the company was generating $600m a year in revenue. At 27 I resigned as CEO, and launched 'The Diary Of A CEO' podcast with the simple mission of un-filtering success and giving you the knowledge you need to create the life you want. \n\nThank you for listening.\n\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/steven\nTW: https://twitter.com/StevenBartlett\nLI: https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenbartlett-123",

The star of &#39;Riverdale&#39;, &#39;The Suite Life&#39; and many more beloved TV shows and films, he&#39;s been possessed with the spirit of creativity since before he was out of his cradle.</p>\n<p>But as he reveals today, he didn&#39;t go into the entertainment industry by choice. He was effectively forced to perform by his mother, with whom he has a complicated, and currently estranged, relationship. To become comfortable inhabiting people in his acting roles, he first had to become comfortable with himself. It hasn&#39;t been an easy journey.</p>\n<p>The new and final season of Riverdale is out later this year, and his photography is available for purchase, or just appreciation at colesprousephotography.com.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Being a child actor</li>\n <li>Your mother</li>\n  <li>Being taken away from my mother</li>\n  <li>What is your validation?</li>\n  <li>Acting career</li>\n  <li>Your mental health</li>\n  <li>Love &amp; Relationships</li>\n  <li>Conversation Cards</li>\n  <li>Last guest\u2019s question</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Cole:</p>\n<p>Instagram: https://bit.ly/3YJGklc</p>\n<p>Twitter: https://bit.ly/429em5i</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The conversation cards waitlist is now open, join now:</p>\n<p>http://bit.ly/3l7dhKG</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Watch the episodes on Youtube:\u00a0<a href=\"https://g2ul0.app.link/3kxINCANKsb\">https://g2ul0.app.link/3kxINCANKsb</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Follow:</p>\n<p>Instagram:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3CXkF0d\">https://bit.ly/3CXkF0d</a></p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wBA6bA\">https://bit.ly/3wBA6bA</a></p>\n<p>Linkedin:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3z3CSYM\">https://bit.ly/3z3CSYM</a></p>\n<p>Telegram:\u00a0<a href=\"https://g2ul0.app.link/SBExclusiveCommun\">https://g2ul0.app.link/SBExclusiveCommun</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sponsors:</p>\n<p>Bluejeans: <a href=\"https://g2ul0.app.link/NCgpGjVNKsb\">https://g2ul0.app.link/NCgpGjVNKsb</a></p>\n<p>Wework: <a href=\"https://we.co/ceo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://we.co/ceo</a></p>\n<p>Huel: <a href=\"https://g2ul0.app.link/G4RjcdKNKsb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://g2ul0.app.link/G4RjcdKNKsb</a></p>\n"

Dr Smith discusses the need for value check ins to remember what is important in your life and to reflect on the gradual changes you are making that lead to big meaningful differences in your life.</p>\n<p>Listen to the full episode here - <a href=\"https://g2ul0.app.link/Sew3KrnPIqb\">https://g2ul0.app.link/Sew3KrnPIqb</a></p>\n<p>Dr Julie - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drjulie/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/drjulie/?hl=en</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@drjuliesmith?lang=en\">https://www.tiktok.com/@drjuliesmith?lang=en</a></p>\n<p>Watch the Episodes On Youtube - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos\">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos</a></p>\n"

From a top class player to one its best television pundits, Jamie has devoted his life and career to the sport.</p>\n<p>From a working class upbringing as a Bootle boy to \u201cMr Liverpool\u201d, Jamie has always stayed loyal to his roots and to the city that nurtured and supported him in reaching the heights that his career soared to. However, the sense of duty Jamie felt for his city and its supporters loaded him with a crippling pressure and mental toll.</p>\n<p>In this intimate conversation, Jamie opens the door to a level of sporting achievement that only a select few people ever get to see, discussing both its highs and lows, victories on the pitch and in the mind.

But it\u2019s when we look deep inside ourselves that it\u2019s revealed who we really are, and what we really value.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Early years</li>\n <li>Did you parents teach you how to take care of yourself?</li>\n  <li>The phone call about your brother</li>\n  <li>What was life like after that moment?</li>\n  <li>Advice for someone going through something similar</li>\n  <li>How did your brothers passing change your perspective on life?</li>\n  <li>Your first step into broadcasting</li>\n  <li>Starting at sky</li>\n  <li>Advice for someone starting at the bottom of their career</li>\n  <li>Working in a male dominated industry</li>\n  <li>Sexism in the workplace</li>\n  <li>Your book and podcast</li>\n  <li>How true is the \u2018midlife crisis?</li>\n  <li>Menopause</li>\n  <li>Finding out your husband had cancer</li>\n  <li>Your partner Kenny</li>\n  <li>Advice for maintaining a solid relationship</li>\n  <li>The last guest question</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Gabby:</p>\n<p>Twitter -https://bit.ly/3FrWn14</p>\n<p>Instagram -&nbsp;https://bit.ly/3DK00OH</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Gabby's book - https://amzn.to/3fkDcMe</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Dairy sign up link: bit.ly/3fUcF8q</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://g2ul0.app.link/3kxINCANKsb</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Follow us on Telegram: https://g2ul0.app.link/E5re0ADNKsb</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sponsors:</p>\n<p>Mercedes-Benz - https://bit.ly/3yXTQI1</p>\n<p>Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/G4RjcdKNKsb</p>\n"

He walks us through how he breaks his 'rehearsal of failure' and the worries that plague his head through meditation.

As Mo powerfully says, \u201850% of what I know is wrong\u2019, and this is true for everyone. Coming to life from this position of humbleness is the only way we can truly get our head straight on what our life is and where it\u2019s taking us. There are things that you need, like food and human interaction, and there are things that you want, like status or expensive possessions. Interrogating the insecurity in our wants and why we really want them is the best way to be at peace with ourselves, and to cut out toxic habits from our life.

Both of them have been so successful because both of them want the other to be successful, and this generosity of spirit is something we can all bring to our own lives.\n\nListen to the full episode here - \u00a0https://g2ul0.app.link/e8DcqM1RErb\n\nKarren:\nhttps://twitter.com/karren_brady?s=20&t=FeA1tytuSw8D0GiMF6LSHA\u00a0\nhttps://www.instagram.com/karren_brady_official/channel/?hl=en\n\nWatch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos",

When she phoned him up asking how he was doing, he gave her an answer she was not expecting. She would never have imagined having to receive something like this from her son.

One of the first skincare brands when it launched in the 1980s, Jane got people to care about something they didn\u2019t realise was important. Today she finally tells her incredible story in this conversation and in her new book, Skin in the Game.</p>\n<p>Jane\u2019s story to self-independence begins when she was in a toxic relationship with a controlling boyfriend, in a strange country she knew little about.

                "summary": "<p>In these \u2018Moment\u2019 episodes of my podcast, I\u2019ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a favourite moment of mine because its so obviously clear that we should all be taking time for ourselves when we never do. This is a moment from my episode with Jay Shetty, the best-selling author of Think Like a Monk, host of the No. 1 podcast On Purpose and one of the most wise people I have ever met. Very few people can reach into depths of insight on such a wide array of topics like he does. I learnt so many things I didn't even realise I needed to know from this conversation, and I know you will too - this being one of them. Meditation. A difficult one to get on board with.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We always hear that we must meditate more, but we never really practice it. Why? Because it's too woo-woo, or time wasting. Well here, Jay explains how much meditation can add value to our lives. All we have to do is put a time in our schedule that is time for us. Even if it\u2019s 5 minutes a day, when we get that notification, we have to do something with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second step of meditation and taking time for ourselves is focusing on our breath. It's wildly underestimated yet it's one of the most important aspects of the human body. Our breath is connected to every single emotion, physicality and mentality.Meditation and breath are the practical tools we all need in our daily lives.</p>\n<p>Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/bATwFLLBwqb</p>\n<p>Jay - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayshetty?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">https://twitter.com/jayshetty?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jayshetty/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/jayshetty/?hl=en</a></p>\n<p>Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos</p>\n"

She reiterated here that we aren\u2019t born shy. It\u2019s often our situational environments that create and shape who we are later on. No matter how shy or inverted we are, everyone has a fire inside them, an ambition and a burning desire to do what they believe is right. Jacqueline is a great believer that courage comes first, it forces you out of your comfort zone, and when you do this, confidence will come and great things will happen.</p>\n<p>Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/e4eJGthNMpb</p>\n<p>Jacqueline - https://jacquelinegold.com https://www.instagram.com/jacquelinegoldcbe/</p>\n<p>Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos</p>\n"

He is also the author of several best-selling memoirs.</p>\n<p>His long affinity for journalism has seen him leaving and starting new roles across ITV, CNN and NBC. Some of the shows include Piers Morgan Life Stories, Good Morning Britain, Britain\u2019s Got Talent, and his newest - Piers Morgan Uncensored, beginning April 24 on the new TalkTv. In this conversation we touch subjects of mental resilience, cancel-culture, mental health and veganism.</p>\n<p>You may not like it, it may not be comfortable to listen to, but this interview was an important debate which made me think about many of the things we spoke about.

He is also the author of several best-selling memoirs.\nHis long affinity for journalism has seen him leaving and starting new roles across ITV, CNN and NBC. Some of the shows include Piers Morgan Life Stories, Good Morning Britain, Britain\u2019s Got Talent, and his newest - Piers Morgan Uncensored, beginning April 24 on the new TalkTv. In this conversation we touch subjects of mental resilience, cancel-culture, mental health and veganism.\nYou may not like it, it may not be comfortable to listen to, but this interview was an important debate which made me think about many of the things we spoke about. Piers believes his voice of common sense, acts as a vital counter-narrative to have in society and encourages us to build resilience, stimulate debate and stop over labelling things.\nTopics:\nWhat made you the person we see today?\nMental resilience vs mental health\nHow did you get ahead so quickly in your career?\nMarketing yourself using controversy\nHow have you dealt with your ups and downs?\nWhat would it take for you and Meghan Markle to make up?\nThe effect your media appearance has on your children\nWhen does Piers Morgan cry?\nPiers Morgan Uncensored\nThe last guest's question\n\nPiers:\nhttps://twitter.com/piersmorgan\nhttps://www.instagram.com/piersmorgan/\n\nPiers Morgan Uncensored:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/PiersMorganUncensored/featured\n\nWatch the episodes on Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos\n\nFollow us on Telegram:\u00a0https://t.me/diaryofaceo\n\n\nSponsors:\nHuel - https://my.huel.com/Steven\nMyenergi - https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl",

What strikes me about Lewis is someone who\u2019s come so far after his life was turned upside down.

Here we discuss the common misconceptions many people have about sleep, including the much perceived importance of getting those 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night.

Molly is definitely someone we\u2019re going to be hearing a lot more from, after speaking to her I think I began to understand why.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Topics</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Your early years</li>\n<li>How do you balance your time?</li>\n<li>Love Island &amp; wanting more</li>\n<li>Your social life</li>\n<li>What are the downsides to your success?</li>\n<li>How do you switch off?</li>\n<li>How do you stay relatable?</li>\n<li>Are you happy with all of this?</li>\n<li>The decision to remove the filler from your face\u00a0</li>\n<li>Impostor syndrome</li>\n<li>Money and finance lessons from all of this</li>\n<li>Pretty Little Thing - Creative Director role</li>\n<li>The break-in to your home</li>\n<li>Do you miss your old life?</li>\n<li>Whats it like being a women in business?\u00a0</li>\n<li>Tommy and your relationship</li>\n<li>Whats next for you?</li>\n<li>The last guests question</li>\n<li>Advice to a younger Molly Mae</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Molly:</div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mollymae/\">https://www.instagram.com/mollymae/</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mollymaehague\">https://twitter.com/mollymaehague</a></div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-F3kTU4V680v550AavEOsQ\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-F3kTU4V680v550AavEOsQ</a>\u00a0<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>THE DIARY OF A CEO LIVE TICKETS ON SALE NOW \ud83d\ude80- <a href=\"https://g2ul0.app.link/diaryofaceolive\">https://g2ul0.app.link/diaryofaceolive</a>\n</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Watch the episodes on Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/StevenBartlettYT?sub_confirmation=1\">https://www.youtube.com/StevenBartlettYT?sub_confirmation=1</a>\n</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Sponsors:\u00a0</div>\n<div>Huel - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbDRjMW1YYUExamJvWl9LSlNSclVtTl93QVZmd3xBQ3Jtc0trWnFmUHI0bUNNdmo3enRNX2lTYm53aWkxS01yTXFQX2F2b1hfdlJtN3hWdnUxTzhmY1N5WnFnR1V4QXliN0JHdGFBc3NEclp6ZFBZRm5nb1ZpUTVGbjlEdXI0bGpZa3hfOF9uNkJEZG9NY1VEcUw1bw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.huel.com%2F\">https://uk.huel.com/</a>\n</div>\n<div>Myenergi - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbnNTUGxUN2lGMlNOYWxUak40dTl1Q1RPbnkzZ3xBQ3Jtc0trdEktQ21IdzVYSW44bU5yaWxfbmNib0RUZF9nYktHZm43TnEyWEVwaTY0My1idGVqT2IzblNfc0hUaXc4X2dialotc21OWEd5QlBXWWpRSndYeHNNWHZMaWpPT3J5bTFqdVkxdWlrM3RhRWRNRl9Kaw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3oeWGnl\">https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl</a>\n</div>\n"

If Patrice can overcome his background and experiences, you can overcome yours.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>In this episode, Patrice opens up as never before on his background and his experiences when he was young, and after listening to this you\u2019ll want to join us in thanking him for his honesty. Patrice has come through experiences most of us can\u2019t even imagine.</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Patrice also gives us the inside on what made Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s Manchester United such a winning machine, what people have got wrong about it, and where people go wrong in trying to achieve their own successful mindsets. In this podcast, you\u2019ll be schooled on how to reach the top, and how to stay there.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Topics:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Your early years</li>\n<li>Child abuse</li>\n<li>Your brother</li>\n<li>Toxic masculinity\u00a0</li>\n<li>What does football mean to you</li>\n<li>Joining Manchester United</li>\n<li>Sir Alex Ferguson</li>\n<li>You and Luis Suarez</li>\n<li>Being the best person you can be</li>\n<li>The last guests question</li>\n</ul>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Patrice:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/patrice.evra/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/patrice.evra/?hl=en</a>\u00a0</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Patrice\u2019s Book: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Patrice-Evra/e/B07FZD3YMC%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Patrice-Evra/e/B07FZD3YMC%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share</a>\u00a0</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Watch the episodes on Youtube:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/StevenBartlettYT?sub_confirmation=1\"> https://www.youtube.com/StevenBartlettYT?sub_confirmation=1</a>\n</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>The Diary Of A CEO live - Sign up here - <a href=\"https://g2ul0.app.link/diaryofaceolive\">https://g2ul0.app.link/diaryofaceolive</a>\n</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Sponsor: <a href=\"https://uk.huel.com/\">https://uk.huel.com/</a>\u00a0</div>\n"

He was originally known for uploading rants about his football, but has since become best-known for the eponymous <em>True Geordie Podcast</em>, hosted by himself and his best friend Laurence McKenna.

And let\u2019s face it, Monzo, one of the companies Tom founded and led, is the one of the most forward-thinking, innovative, fastest-growing companies there is.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Tom was born in Hong Kong and lived with his father and mother. His father was a business-minded civil engineer and his mother was an artist. When Tom was a child, he moved to London to attend grammar school in Amersham, Buckinghamshire then moving on to study Law at Oxford. Whilst studying at Oxford, at the age of 21, he co-founded <a href=\"http://Boso.com\">Boso.com</a> an \u201ceBay for students\u201d.

Through severe bullying and family upheaval, he moved home six times and went to six different schools within ten years of his life.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>After an unfortunate incident as a nightclub bouncer involving the death of a patron, Ben fell into a world of drug abuse, gambling and addiction, balancing on the brink of life. Broke, with no home or anyone to turn to, he abused his addictions every day and battled suicidal thoughts.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Ben saw an advert on YouTube for the Royal Marines and knew he had one chance left at life by joining. Joining the marines gave him a purpose, he trained religiously, day and night to get fit and read and revised military tactics to increase his knowledge.\u00a0 And he didn\u2019t have a single hand in getting clean from the drugs \u2013 his mind, determination and sheer drive got him clean \u2013 he was thinking differently.</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>During his ten years with the Royal Marines \u2013 one of the most elite regiments in the world, Ben travelled the world, seeing active operational duties in Afghanistan. The Corps was a rollercoaster journey involving the extreme highs, and lows of war. After being injured in an IED blast in Afghanistan, he returned to the UK with the horrors of war still imprinted on his mind. He had to stay at home with his thoughts \u2013 now in a completely new battle.\u00a0 He turned back into his old self before the marines, drinking, gambling and getting in trouble. The dark thoughts were intrusive. After one alcohol fuelled event, Ben was court-martialed and sent for trial; with his first son on the way he was staring at a four-year sentence for assault, but he fortunately escaped prison by a judge who took pity on him.</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Broken and at his wits end, a friend lent him \u2018the chimp paradox\u2019; and he found himself immersed in self help books and receiving treatment for PTSD.

In 2010 she was awarded an MBE for her services to sport.<br>\n<br>\nHemmings achieved this success against all the odds. She was told by the British head coach that she was not big enough or strong enough to be a great kayaker. She proved him wrong. At the peak of her career, Anna was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\u00a0 and was told by medical experts she might never race again. She battled her way to full recovery and went on to win a further 3 world titles and compete at her second Olympic Games in Beijing 2008. She has become an expert in the field of resilience and high performance. Anna is now an Executive coach and founded Beyond the Barriers, a high performance training consultancy which works globally with leaders and teams giving them practical tools and strategies to enable them to thrive under pressure, build resilience, be mentally tough in challenging environments and deliver world class performance.<br>\n<br>\nAnna\u2019s sporting achievements were recognised at the Sunday Times Sports Woman of the Year Awards, where she won the 2005 Champions Award and then again in 2007 when she was voted BBC London Sports Personality of the Year.<br>\n<br>\nThis week's podcast gave me more realisations than I\u2019ve ever had from a guest before.
