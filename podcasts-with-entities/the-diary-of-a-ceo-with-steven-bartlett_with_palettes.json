    "description": "A few years ago I was a broke, university dropout, living in a studio-flat in a rough area. At 18 I started a company which would eventually become \"Social Chain\" - an industry leading marketing company. At 26 the company was generating $600m a year in revenue. At 27 I resigned as CEO, and launched 'The Diary Of A CEO' podcast with the simple mission of un-filtering success and giving you the knowledge you need to create the life you want. Thank you for listening. My New Book: https://smarturl.it/D IG: https://www.instagram.com/steven LI: https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenbartlett-123",

After 4 appearances with Newcastle United, he spent the next few years on loan to various clubs. However, in 2018 Ivan began to build his reputation as a top striker when he joined Peterborough United, scoring 49 goals in 94 appearances. In 2020, Ivan signed with Brentford, helping them win promotion to the Premier League in his first season. In November 2022, the FA charged Ivan with 232 counts of breaching betting rules between 2017 and 2021, he was fined \u00a350,000 and banned from playing professional football until 17 January 2024. In this conversation Ivan and Steven discuss topics, such as: Finding football at a young age The advice Ivan would give to his younger self When he began gambling The impact that rejection by teams had on him His journey in football being a constant climb How moving to the Premier League changed his mindset Mixing with the wrong crowd when in the Premier League Not feeling as if he was given the chance to prove himself early in his career Taking chances and becoming a top goal scorer Becoming a father at a young age and its impact on him Advice that he would give to his children if they wanted to become footballers Why Brentford is so special and it\u2019s superpower as a team The mentality that management instils at Brentford The importance of having self belief His gambling addiction How he believes that FA made an example out of him Why he was not match fixing His lowest point during his playing ban Being denied entry to a restaurant because of the allegations against him Seeing this chapter of his life as a learning moment How young footballers not being given advice on how to spend their money wisely The racist abuse he has received Why he stopped taking the knee before matches How he plans to be scoring goals in January 2024 Follow Ivan: Instagram: https://bit.ly/47wdaMe Twitter: https://bit.ly/3QM9a4p Watch the episodes on Youtube -\u00a0\u2060\u2060https://g2ul0.app.link/3kxINCANKsb\u2060\u2060 My new book!

Whether that was perfecting her craft of content creation or learning radical empathy from her psychologist mother, these have all been used in her unmatched interviews with the world\u2019s biggest celebrities. In this expansive conversation Alex discusses her journey to becoming Daddy. From overcoming childhood bullying and self-doubt, hustling and taking advantage of every opportunity that presented itself, Alex has grown and evolved into the icon she is today and taken her devoted Daddy Gang along for the ride. Topics: What shaped you? Being bullied & how content saved me How did therapy help you? Call her daddy co-hosts The words you wished were said Call Her Daddy success\u00a0What made it the no.1 female podcast? What's the hidden cost? Spotify $60M Deal Did men feel emasculated with your success? What pain do you enjoy having? Do you think your younger self would be proud? What's next for you?

The star of 'Riverdale', 'The Suite Life' and many more beloved TV shows and films, he's been possessed with the spirit of creativity since before he was out of his cradle. But as he reveals today, he didn't go into the entertainment industry by choice. He was effectively forced to perform by his mother, with whom he has a complicated, and currently estranged, relationship. To become comfortable inhabiting people in his acting roles, he first had to become comfortable with himself. It hasn't been an easy journey. The new and final season of Riverdale is out later this year, and his photography is available for purchase, or just appreciation at colesprousephotography.com.

From worrying about the impression you want to make, what to wear, where to go and whether this is your future life partner or not, the expectations you set for a first date become impossible.

                "summary": "There is love for the beautiful game and then there is the all consuming passion that Jamie Carragher has for football. From a top class player to one its best television pundits, Jamie has devoted his life and career to the sport. From a working class upbringing as a Bootle boy to \u201cMr Liverpool\u201d, Jamie has always stayed loyal to his roots and to the city that nurtured and supported him in reaching the heights that his career soared to. However, the sense of duty Jamie felt for his city and its supporters loaded him with a crippling pressure and mental toll. In this intimate conversation, Jamie opens the door to a level of sporting achievement that only a select few people ever get to see, discussing both its highs and lows, victories on the pitch and in the mind. As well as the journey from a boyhood fan to the local legend that is \u2018Carra\u2019.

                "summary": "To call Stephen Fry a national treasure would be underselling him. One of the hardest working names in British media, you name it and Stephen has done it; writer, actor, director and comedian. The size of his contribution to British culture in over four decades as a public figure is staggering. However, behind this mountain of work and out of the spotlight is a side of Stephen Fry that many people will be completely unaware of, from a childhood of crime and loneliness, to severe mental health struggles and attempts at suicide. In this honest and revealing conversation Stephen discusses the scars he carries within him and which affect him to this day. But despite this he is constantly reinventing himself and striving to find joy in the smaller things in life, all the while spreading happiness and wonder with his work. Topics: Early context Credit card fraud - getting arrested Feeling like an outsider Going to Cambridge Why acting? Where happiness really comes from How can we change who we are? What has changed from the core of your younger self Lowest moment in your life Manic depression Your relationship with social media Depressive lows Why have you been successful Are we all artists? What creates a good life for you?

In this episode, she reveals after leaving Tinder in explosive circumstances, the injustices she faced drove her on to build a better kind of dating app. A firm believer that the way to connect with people is by being authentic and being vulnerable, Whitney reveals she routinely shares with her staff her struggles with anxiety and when she\u2019s not feeling on top of things. The only path to human connection lies through honesty, and Whitney breaks the mould to be as transparent with her employees as she can. In one of our rawest and most emotional conversations with CEOs yet, Whitney reveals that she wanted to be the boss not because she wanted to, but because she thought the nature of her character meant she couldn\u2019t work for anybody else.

But what\u2019s striking about Raphael\u2019s story is it\u2019s often the simple things that get us through the difficult moments. A good relationship, exercise, self awareness. Raphael really illustrates how control over basic components of self and social awareness help people survive in even the toughest environments. Topics: Early context Getting kicked out of school Getting kidnapped Trying to fit into an environment Having a child Your relationship with your son now The moment your life changed forever Were you hopeful? The moment you hear the verdict This podcast this streamed in prison Did you think you were going to spend your whole life in prison? Seeing people taking their own lives People being paid to make false statements Story about a chaplain The first domino that lead to your release The moment you found out you were being released Did they ever say you were innocent? How much compensation did they give you? Psychological scars What have you learnt about the importance of hope Your foundation Have you forgiven anyone for what they did to you? Would you erase those years?

Will is the classic example that business and entrepreneurial drive follow on from being obsessed with a problem.\u00a0After repeatedly getting injured in his college sports career, Will became obsessed with understanding his own body. He read over five hundred medical papers and realised the product he was pining for didn\u2019t exist, so he invented it. Will has one of the most original perspectives on how to bring your personality to your business that we\u2019ve ever seen. Employees at Whoop get a bonus if their sleep is good, and the company is ruthless in its priorities to make sure it\u2019s only focused on a couple of things at a time. All of this means Whoop has some of the best wearable tech on the market, despite only a fraction of the resources of its competitors. Topics: Early years What was it that made you obsessed with optimising performance? Are you a curious person?

One of the best actors of his generation, with honours from Queen Elizabeth to prove it, David\u2019s road to the top had to overcome his psychosis, which at one point drove him to the point of insanity and left him sectioned into a psychiatric hospital. With his life as he knew it on the brink, David rebuilt his life and career to reach the very top of the entertainment business. Scars like this take time to mend, and sometimes leave unexpected traces. David is controversially honest that losing his mind, in a way, helped him find his creativity. This isn\u2019t the message that everyone wants to hear, but David\u2019s frankness about how his darkest times set him apart from everyone else is a story you don\u2019t want to miss. Topics: Early years Racism Your fathers illness Social rejection from everyone What would you have had to change inorder to not be sectioned? The night you got sectioned Being sectioned: Biology vs experiences The time being being sectioned and back to acting Opening up about your breakdown Where are you now? Why you?

Charging up to $300,000 a set, he\u2019s one of the most coveted and in-demand DJs in the game today. But what people may not know about him is that he\u2019s climbed to the top of the DJ world while being able to spin with only one arm, losing his ability to use the other in a tragic childhood accident. From the greatest adversity comes the greatest achievement, though, and Black Coffee took it as more inspiration to drive towards his dreams - relentlessly, unrelentingly, fearlessly.

In this moment Mo Gawdat lays out a philosophy for how to admit when you\u2019re wrong, and the right way to go about setting priorities in your life. As Mo powerfully says, \u201850% of what I know is wrong\u2019, and this is true for everyone. Coming to life from this position of humbleness is the only way we can truly get our head straight on what our life is and where it\u2019s taking us. There are things that you need, like food and human interaction, and there are things that you want, like status or expensive possessions. Interrogating the insecurity in our wants and why we really want them is the best way to be at peace with ourselves, and to cut out toxic habits from our life. Because as Mo never tires of pointing out, it\u2019s not how much money we have, but what amount of money we\u2019re happy with, that counts.\u00a0Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/4GuqQfBYltb Mo:\u00a0https://www.solveforhappy.com https://www.instagram.com/mo_gawdat/?hl=en Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos\nLearn more about your ad choices.

In this moment, Simon Sinek talks about how we can find purpose in our lives through attaching it to causes bigger than ourselves. There are things that we can achieve by ourselves, but true satisfaction and real pride in our achievements always comes from being part of a team or a collective. A wider cause or a group we care about is the only thing that would cause us to make real sacrifices. Simon\u2019s thought long and hard about how we can take projects in the workplace and in our social lives and infuse them with real meaning for everyone involved with them. What\u2019s emerged is a profound meditation on where human satisfaction really comes from, and a step by step guide on how to bring these principles into your life.

Like James\u2019 brutally honest fitness advice, there\u2019s no quick fix to confidence, or any miracle cure. James starts, like he always does, by looking at himself honestly - and truthfully - in the mirror, and all he asks is we do the same as well. James\u2019 book is out today.

In one of his most emotional and heartfelt interviews to date, Gary opens up about precisely what drove him and his similarly successful siblings on - his brother is the England-capped footballer Philip Neville, while his sister is the former Head Coach of England Netball, Tracey Neville - despite their very humble origins. A legend of Manchester United and a former captain of the club, he goes into detail about precisely what made the team culture of the Sir Alex Ferguson years so strong, why its so sorely lacking now, why he\u2019s felt the need to speak out more on social and political issues, and why everything he does is for the city he grew up in and calls home.

Far too many people are afraid of just following their instincts to what makes them happiest and most fulfilled. Jonny Wilkinson doesn\u2019t have time for any of that, or for following the expectations other people set. Jonny is interested in what makes you unique, and he thinks you should be too. Jonny\u2019s also got a word of warning, though, because your real self is who you are when you\u2019re alone with your own thoughts. And Jonny\u2019s weren\u2019t happy. He scaled as high as it\u2019s possible to go in world rugby, but he found the process demoralising, and he wasn\u2019t happy. It took Jonny a long time to find a way to be happy in his passion, but that makes his journey all the more interesting, and his advice for your journey all the more profound too.

Marcus Buckingham, is one of the world's most in-demand career experts and the author of several best-selling business books focusing on strengths versus weaknesses, how to take feedback, how to love your work and identify leadership. In this moment I talk to Marcus about how we are supposed to build a great career that we love.\u00a0The three main question points we all ask ourselves when we are in a working role is the \u2018who\u2019, the \u2018what\u2019 and the \u2018why\u2019. The \u2018why\u2019 is so important to think about - why are you doing doing what you are currently doing, why do you believe in the purpose of what you are doing? The \u2018who\u2019 is also crucial. Working with people you like, being in a great team, and amongst inspiring people plays a powerful role in our work. But for Marcus, the \u2018what\u2019 trumps the \u2018who and \u2018why\u2019. What are the activities and roles you are actually doing?\u00a0What do you love about them?\u00a0\u00a0Marcus has a theory about the different threads our days are made up of. These threads ultimately create the fabric of a work day; layers, structures, colours, textures, which can be interpreted into feelings, highs, lows, loves and loathes. The most successful people are able to identify what threads work well for them. In order for this to happen, we need an early framework and a sense of shared understanding about what we naturally lean into, our passions and skills.\u00a0If we start early on the right threads from a younger age, we will be able to create a career that we love.

The \u2018why\u2019 is so important to think about - why are you doing doing what you are currently doing, why do you believe in the purpose of what you are doing? The \u2018who\u2019 is also crucial. Working with people you like, being in a great team, and amongst inspiring people plays a powerful role in our work. But for Marcus, the \u2018what\u2019 trumps the \u2018who and \u2018why\u2019. What are the activities and roles you are actually doing?\u00a0What do you love about them?\u00a0\u00a0Marcus has a theory about the different threads our days are made up of. These threads ultimately create the fabric of a work day; layers, structures, colours, textures, which can be interpreted into feelings, highs, lows, loves and loathes. The most successful people are able to identify what threads work well for them. In order for this to happen, we need an early framework and a sense of shared understanding about what we naturally lean into, our passions and skills.\u00a0If we start early on the right threads from a younger age, we will be able to create a career that we love.

From binge drinking to cancel culture, sexual empowerment to race and politics - Africa isn\u2019t afraid to speak completely honestly and frankly about anything. No one has come in to speak to us with as much honesty and vulnerability as Africa. This is a one-of-a-kind conversation that left us speechless. There's never a topic on Diary of a CEO that\u2019s off-limits, we will always bring you the world\u2019s leading people telling their honest truth. What to make of their opinions is up to you, but as soon as Africa walked through the door of my kitchen to record, any pre-conceptions of what she was about to say were left on the other side. She certainly didn\u2019t hold anything back. Africa: Topics: Early years - my father What is your dark side? What was the cost? How to break out of a negative reinforcing cycle? What do you still self sabotage Left vs Right Accountability Selfawareness A journey with sex and sexuality What is the pain you enjoy having? What ideas do you hold to be true that everyone else disagrees with?

As well as this, he is also an actor, and the star of Creed with Sylvester Stallone, and the author of last year's bestselling book, Everybody Has A Plan Until They Get Punched in the Face. In this raw, honest and emotional interview, Tony breaks down exactly why people dedicate their life to fighting, and how it\u2019s often because they have no other choice.

The host of Man vs. Wild, You vs. Wild, Running Wild, The Island, and the author of Mud, Sweat and Tears and over twenty other books, he\u2019s come in to talk to us about his new book - Never Give Up. Bear has always told himself a story about himself that he\u2019s \u2018resilient\u2019, he\u2019s pushed through the toughest challenges the world has to offer - from climbing Everest to surviving in the desert - because he\u2019s told himself he\u2019s the type of person who survives. But now, he reflects to us about the costs of that mentality, and where it leaves you when you come up short. Bear\u2019s new book is a follow-up to his smash-hit bestseller Mud, Sweat and Tears. He\u2019s spent five years writing it, written every single word himself, and shares some lessons from his life he\u2019s never felt comfortable sharing before.

Roman Kemp tells us about the time he nearly lost his life, and how he was saved by a simple phone call from his mother checking up on him. Suffering from depression since he was a teenager, Roman has sometimes had trouble finding balance in his life. Thankfully, no one knew the ins and outs of his struggle like his mother. When she phoned him up asking how he was doing, he gave her an answer she was not expecting. She would never have imagined having to receive something like this from her son. Simple check ups with our friends and loved ones can have much more impact than we ever anticipate. Likewise, being open about our feelings can help to change them if they\u2019ve gone down a bad path.

A trailblazer and an innovator, Example started out as a rapper before moving over into dance, lighting up Glastonbury, Isle of Wight and Global Gathering among many, many other festivals. After only being able to harness his traumas in order to be successful, he quit his hard-partying rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle and found happiness and balance in his life, and found a way to be happy in his music too.

Control the narrative, and your ability to direct the course of your own life comes easily.

This is a moment from my episode with Jay Shetty, the best-selling author of Think Like a Monk, host of the No. 1 podcast On Purpose and one of the most wise people I have ever met. Very few people can reach into depths of insight on such a wide array of topics like he does. I learnt so many things I didn't even realise I needed to know from this conversation, and I know you will too - this being one of them. Meditation. A difficult one to get on board with.\u00a0We always hear that we must meditate more, but we never really practice it. Why? Because it's too woo-woo, or time wasting. Well here, Jay explains how much meditation can add value to our lives. All we have to do is put a time in our schedule that is time for us. Even if it\u2019s 5 minutes a day, when we get that notification, we have to do something with it.\u00a0The second step of meditation and taking time for ourselves is focusing on our breath. It's wildly underestimated yet it's one of the most important aspects of the human body. Our breath is connected to every single emotion, physicality and mentality.Meditation and breath are the practical tools we all need in our daily lives.

Mel is the author of The Five Second Rule, a business woman, a life coach, and a sensation in the world of self improvement. At a point in her life Mel was really struggling with huge amounts of depression, anxiety, and fear, making it extremely difficult for her to get out of bed in the morning and generally just be present in her life. This moment describes the method that has changed Mel\u2019s mindset to become who she is today. Mel got herself out of her dark side which saw her marinating in fear and anxiety, using her Five Second Rule. The rule was born from that window of hesitation that comes into our minds before we make a decision, a decision that could define your whole life. Inside that window lives fear, anxiety, procrastination and imposter syndrome, so we create patterns of feeling, patterns of behaviour, and patterns of thinking that tempt us to steer away from making that decision.\u00a0It can be a dangerous cycle getting stuck in these broken patterns of denial so Mel brings this down to one fundamental method. The Five Second rule works because of its simplicity. You make yourself a promise, you count backwards - 5,4,3,2,1 then you do it.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "In these \u2018Moment\u2019 episodes of my podcast, I\u2019ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO.\u00a0This week, I\u2019ve chosen a section from my conversation with Mel Robbins. Mel is the author of The Five Second Rule, a business woman, a life coach, and a sensation in the world of self improvement. At a point in her life Mel was really struggling with huge amounts of depression, anxiety, and fear, making it extremely difficult for her to get out of bed in the morning and generally just be present in her life. This moment describes the method that has changed Mel\u2019s mindset to become who she is today. Mel got herself out of her dark side which saw her marinating in fear and anxiety, using her Five Second Rule. The rule was born from that window of hesitation that comes into our minds before we make a decision, a decision that could define your whole life. Inside that window lives fear, anxiety, procrastination and imposter syndrome, so we create patterns of feeling, patterns of behaviour, and patterns of thinking that tempt us to steer away from making that decision.\u00a0It can be a dangerous cycle getting stuck in these broken patterns of denial so Mel brings this down to one fundamental method. The Five Second rule works because of its simplicity. You make yourself a promise, you count backwards - 5,4,3,2,1 then you do it.

In 2010 she shot to fame with the release of her first single, Do It Like A Dude. She has since sold millions of records, performed at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and been a judge on the talent shows The Voice and The Voice Kids. This episode with Jessie is a special conversation. She was candid and open about the highs and lows throughout her life, and shared with me some things that she has never voiced before. From her early childhood memories, to the fame and success of her music, to health issues and grief, Jessie spoke with such honesty and tenderness. But she also talks about how she has enabled herself to break open and embrace the grief that she has stored up and hidden away. Jessie is someone who has always come out fighting, and here she goes into how that\u2019s been possible in a way she never has before. We learn about how to stay grounded as you become famous, especially in the dizzying swirl of Los Angeles. I want to thank Jessie for her honesty and for taking the time to record this episode with me, it will certainly change how you think about a lot of things in life. Topics: My childhood and health problems Growth in moments of sadness and pain Finding out about your fertility problems Dealing with everything hitting you at once What would you say to your old self? Not knowing who I was Were record labels defining who you were? Finding the right team for you Why did you disappear? How did the pandemic impact you?

It is important to resurface these ideas about productivity so that we can get the most out of our lives. This was an incredibly engaging conversation, as he tells me how he manages to squeeze every moment from his day.\u00a0Ali mentions here that in order to do our tasks in the most efficient way, we should shift our mindset to think they are fun. This means that we become intrinsically motivated to complete them. One way in which we can do this is change \u2018I have to\u2026\u2019 to \u2018I get to\u2026\u2019. Shifting our mind to think that something is fun, will make us feel so much better about ourselves once the task is done.\u00a0I also mentioned that when I have my own time to choose when I can be productive, I create time sensitive and task specific blocks in my mind.

Escaping his abusive father, and spending decades cultivating his bodybuilder physique and mentality, Terry then broke into the Hollywood scene. This episode is the Terry Crews we have never seen before. We talk about some extremely deep, raw material and explore his deeply personal story of his childhood which led him into an addiction to appearing outwardly tough. His journey to where he is now is inspiring and the way he speaks about it is so humbling. Certain areas of his life that became out of control such as violence, sex, relationships, racism, shame, made him learn how to seek control of himself and his environment. His latest book, Tough: My Journey to True Power, is a moving autobiography where Terry faces these insecurities and distressing memories. Topics: What made you the person you are today? Domestic violence in your family Where did your dad's pain come from ? My pornography addiction How did porn impact your marriage? Cheating on my wife Opening up to my wife and its consequences Why do men avoid intimacy and vulnerability ? What was your lowest moment ?

His long affinity for journalism has seen him leaving and starting new roles across ITV, CNN and NBC.

In this conversation we touch subjects of mental resilience, cancel-culture, mental health and veganism. You may not like it, it may not be comfortable to listen to, but this interview was an important debate which made me think about many of the things we spoke about. Piers believes his voice of common sense, acts as a vital counter-narrative to have in society and encourages us to build resilience, stimulate debate and stop over labelling things.

            "contentSnippet": "Piers Morgan is a journalist and television host who hasn't stayed out of the headlines since being made the youngest newspaper editor in Britain when he took over the News of the World at the age of 28, almost 30 years ago. Over the years he has attracted controversy for his disputed tactics in breaking news stories and television interviews. He is also the author of several best-selling memoirs. His long affinity for journalism has seen him leaving and starting new roles across ITV, CNN and NBC. Some of the shows include Piers Morgan Life Stories, Good Morning Britain, Britain\u2019s Got Talent, and his newest - Piers Morgan Uncensored, beginning April 24 on the new TalkTv. In this conversation we touch subjects of mental resilience, cancel-culture, mental health and veganism. You may not like it, it may not be comfortable to listen to, but this interview was an important debate which made me think about many of the things we spoke about. Piers believes his voice of common sense, acts as a vital counter-narrative to have in society and encourages us to build resilience, stimulate debate and stop over labelling things. Topics: What made you the person we see today? Mental resilience vs mental health How did you get ahead so quickly in your career?

Rochelle has been performing professionally and presenting television since she was in school, and is also the entrepreneur behind innovative hair and skincare brand My Little Coco. Rochelle found success by being true to herself, and following her instincts. We all know this can be hard to do, so here we talk about how to make those decisions easier.

It comes down to if we are always looking for 100% of the facts, data and certainty to get our decisions over the line, it leads to huge procrastination and time-wasting. Getting to that 51% is a much more efficient system, and it reassures us that it will be the right decision to make.

In this clip, we talk about one section of her book that hones in on the idea of being more self-compassionate. It's something I\u2019ve spoken about a lot, talking about this voice inside our heads that talks to us. What Fearne says here is that we need to choose what we listen to, and what we focus on. We need to focus on the stuff that we like about ourselves and the things that we really want to celebrate. It\u2019s a matter of where we put our attention and focus, and that is a hard practical discipline that we need to work on. It\u2019s so important that we learn to become more self-compassionate.

Because it isn\u2019t the destination, it's the journey that takes us there. What people don't know about Jordan is that he's from a small town, in an oil town where alcoholism is very prevalent. Out of this Jordan had to find himself, forge himself. The values he lives by today, the vow he took with his wife never to lie to her, the desire to conduct himself with integrity in all his actions, aren't abstract concepts, they're hard taught lessons.

This week, I want to bring back to you a section from this incredible conversation I had with Stephanie Romiszewski, an experienced sleep physiologist and expert in developing bespoke treatment plans for sleep problems. Here we discuss the common misconceptions many people have about sleep, including the much perceived importance of getting those 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night. Her main piece of advice denotes that perfection is the enemy of the good; dictating our bedtime is the worst thing we can do to ourselves, and instead we should focus on the quality over the quantity of sleep and never expect to get that solid 8 hours that we have all been told to get.\u00a0Finding a reasonable sleep routine, and maintaining it will allow our bodies to regulate and rest, which will eventually train the brain to use our sleep window as a sleep opportunity. Such an overload of misconceptions can go wrong, and cause even more panic for people who have become crippled by their sleep patterns. We often forget how efficient our bodies are, so we need to stop worrying about sleep debt and instead focus on a good routine.Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/OrX6sjtZEob Stephanie-\u00a0https://twitter.com/sleepyclinic https://sleepyheadclinic.co.uk/stephanie-romiszewski-sleep-expert/ Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos\nLearn more about your ad choices.

From humble beginnings in Norwich to one of the largest internet personalties working in Britain today, Jack has had a hell of a ride. But more thought goes into Jack\u2019s comedy and its targets than you might think. Because Jack doesn\u2019t just mock anyone, but is always interrogating himself as to whether he\u2019s mocking the right targets, and whether there\u2019s a sufficient \u2018why?\u2019 to everything he does. His ride to the top hasn\u2019t been easy either, and Jack has had to overcome challenges he never expected along the way. From anxiety to dealing with criticism, Jack gives us the truth about inventing, and then reinventing, yourself on the internet. Topics: Your early years Your fake Youtube persona Your YouTube journey and losing motivation Does money buy happiness Imposter syndrome Why stopped posting on Youtube Have you ever thought about the person on the other side of your criticism?

Here he shares his wisdom about how we can form healthy habits and ways in which to maintain them. He explains that habits can be formed both consciously, based on our belief system, and unconsciously, the ones we aren\u2019t knowingly thinking about. When we look to battle those good habits from the bad, it is not straightforward, and they need to be subdivided.\u00a0Steve is the author of \u201cThe Chimp Paradox\u201d, which has sold millions of copies worldwide and put forward the groundbreaking \u2018Chimp model\u2019 for understanding how our brains work. The model focuses on the 3 parts of the brain and he talks briefly about one of them here. The \u2018Chimp\u2019 which is our desire to be irrational, emotional, impulsive and short-term. Basing habits on our beliefs and experiences is letting the Chimp make those decisions, and sometimes we need to connect the other parts of our brain; the \u2018Human\u2019 and the \u2018Computer\u2019 to manage and control the interaction they have with habits.

Nick Jenkins is the founder and former CEO of Moonpig.com, a company which revolutionised gift cards and is now worth over one and a half billion pounds. In this moment, Nick shares his wisdom with us on the importance of having good communication skills from public speaking to stand-out graphics and polished writing. Your ability to articulate yourself, think coherently and coerce a logical argument is vital to all walks of life whether that is business related or not. People often think that to be a good communicator you have to nail those public speaking events, but what Nick notes is that actually we practice articulating ourselves everyday. Making eye contact, engaging in conversations and listening to people are all things we can do. The more we output, whether that be speaking, writing or drawing the better we naturally become at communicating with people. We compare this to sales because at the baseline, we are always selling ourselves to people we meet, persuading others that we are the best. Nick is an incredible guy who leans on the power of composing yourself well in front of others in order to succeed.

In these \u2018Moment\u2019 episodes of my podcast I usually pick one of my favourite moments across all the episodes, but this week after the heartbreaking news of Jamal\u2019s passing I wanted to collate the best bits of our conversation into a mini montage as a dedication to the prodigious person he was. I hope we can all live in the legacy he left behind. Jamal Edwards played a huge role in my life, he was someone that I admired and looked up to tremendously. He paved the way and proved to young black men like me that I could become successful and achieve big things. Jamal is the founder of SBTV, the first new media business on YouTube, which is hugely successful, and plays a role in launching the careers of many, many people in the music industry, including Ed Sheeran. He talks here about the dimensions of being an entrepreneur, and how the mistakes we make often create the biggest hurdles to overcome and learn from. His wisdom and maturity are inspiring to listen to and as we delve into the subject of achieving happiness, he says his own happiness comes from being able to give back, to improve other people\u2019s lives and to give people the confidence and self-belief he wished he had. We recorded this clip over a year ago, and I wanted to share with you moments from it that capture his genuine empathy, charisma and diligence.

Very few people can reach into depths of insight on such a wide array of topics like he does. I learnt so many things I didn't even realise I needed to know from this conversation, and I know you will too. I definitely was able to put things into perspective in this conversation. Jay has a way of linking very practical advice to really profound insights about life. This conversation went in so many unexpected directions and was definitely one of the discussions I've found most personally valuable. Jay, thank you for sharing your wisdom with us.\u00a0Your early years How to deal with subconscious behaviour patterns\u00a0The Importance of surrounding yourself with good values You\u2019re a very good quitter\u00a0Why do people label themselves in a certain way? Meditation Where do people start with Meditation, breathing techniques Good fear & bad fear\u00a0What do we want to improve personally? What can I do to have an impact on someones life? What do we require for a happy life? Your partnership with Calm Why was Jay Shetty successful?

This one really stood out to me as its a question I get so often, yet I think people are looking at imposter syndrome in completely the wrong way. Facing the feeling of being outside our comfort zone is a challenge to overcome, but with the right mindset we can turn those nerves around into something positive. When you feel butterflies in your stomach, my evidence and interpretation of this nervousness tells me I am ready to do the thing that is instinctively making you anxious. Despite associating imposter syndrome with fear, I strongly believe that it is a good feeling to have. Growth requires us to step outside of our comfort zone, to push ourselves and expand our abilities. Each time you do this, the next time will be just that little bit easier.

This particular moment was taken from an episode where I asked you guys to send in questions you wanted answering. This one really stood out to me as its a question I get so often, yet I think people are looking at imposter syndrome in completely the wrong way. Facing the feeling of being outside our comfort zone is a challenge to overcome, but with the right mindset we can turn those nerves around into something positive. When you feel butterflies in your stomach, my evidence and interpretation of this nervousness tells me I am ready to do the thing that is instinctively making you anxious. Despite associating imposter syndrome with fear, I strongly believe that it is a good feeling to have. Growth requires us to step outside of our comfort zone, to push ourselves and expand our abilities. Each time you do this, the next time will be just that little bit easier. What people call imposter syndrome is a sign you're exactly where you are supposed to be. Though short I felt this was a moment that couldn't be missed.

An icon of rounded masculinity as well as rugged good looks, David has been shining a torch for men for over two decades now.\u00a0   Today, David tells us what it took to reach the top. Starting out as a pizza delivery boy in Essex, David has always had the attitude of wanting to be the best. Some things never change.

He\u2019s co-founded over 20 businesses, he\u2019s the author of the ground-breaking \u2018Solve for Happy\u2019 and he was chief business officer of the pioneering wing of google, Google X, the \u2018moonshot factory\u2019 where they work on all the latest technologies like self-driving cars and robots.\u00a0   But most importantly, Mo has learnt perspective about life. When his son died, this sent him on an incredible journey to look within himself and find the \u2018happiness equation\u2019, a simple technique that can help us all reduce our unhappiness and appreciate life, and ourselves, more.   Mo\u2019s new book is all about Artificial Intelligence. Mo has always been focused on the future and what\u2019s coming next. And for the first time, working on A.I., he was scared. But what Mo found, and what he shares with us, is that the next technological age that\u2019s coming can be a Utopia, if we choose to make it.   Topics:  Why did you write a book about happiness? The passing of your son Ali What is the cause of unhappiness Is happiness a choice? Why my brain is not me Time - The importance of being present The last thing Ali told me No one would rewrite their history How do I know which ambitions to follow?

My guest this week is Will Shu, founder and CEO of Deliveroo. Born in 1979, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, Shu grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, USA. His mother, a scientist, and father, who worked in insurancem. He founded Deliveroo in 2013 with childhood friend and software engineer Greg Orlowski.   Deliveroo operated in London for the first two years, growing via word of mouth. It now operates in 12 countries and more than 200 cities. Deliveroo is worth \u00a35 billion, becoming Europes fastest growing company with 2,000+ employees. In mid-June 2016, Will and Greg received an award for the Best Startup Founders as part of The Europas Startup Conference and Awards, mainly given to technology companies. The company also received Fastest Rising Startup of the Year and the Europas Grand Prix award.\u00a0    In December 2017, a study by macroeconomic consultancy Capital Economics revealed that Deliveroo had helped create 7,200 jobs across the restaurant sector since it launched in 2013. It also boosted the industry's revenue by \u00a3460 million in the year to June 2017. The report also found that Deliveroo had helped add \u00a3372 million in value to the UK economy in the same 12-month period, a figure which Capital Economics projects to rise to \u00a31.5 billion in the year to June 2019.    By mid 2020, Deliveroo had not benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for food delivery from restaurants and takeaways surged. Deliveroo reported to be cutting 367 jobs (and furloughing 50 more) from its workforce of 2,500. Will talks about how hard this decision was that the time in today podcast.   Will is an \u00a0incredible entrepreneur, one thats a far cry from the usual braggadocios CEO of a multi billion dollar company. He\u2019s a humble person and lives a very modest lifestyle saying his life hasn\u2019t change much at all since the early days of Deliveroo.

My guest this week is Will Shu, founder and CEO of Deliveroo. Born in 1979, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, Shu grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, USA. His mother, a scientist, and father, who worked in insurancem. He founded Deliveroo in 2013 with childhood friend and software engineer Greg Orlowski.   Deliveroo operated in London for the first two years, growing via word of mouth. It now operates in 12 countries and more than 200 cities. Deliveroo is worth \u00a35 billion, becoming Europes fastest growing company with 2,000+ employees. In mid-June 2016, Will and Greg received an award for the Best Startup Founders as part of The Europas Startup Conference and Awards, mainly given to technology companies. The company also received Fastest Rising Startup of the Year and the Europas Grand Prix award.\u00a0    In December 2017, a study by macroeconomic consultancy Capital Economics revealed that Deliveroo had helped create 7,200 jobs across the restaurant sector since it launched in 2013. It also boosted the industry's revenue by \u00a3460 million in the year to June 2017. The report also found that Deliveroo had helped add \u00a3372 million in value to the UK economy in the same 12-month period, a figure which Capital Economics projects to rise to \u00a31.5 billion in the year to June 2019.    By mid 2020, Deliveroo had not benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for food delivery from restaurants and takeaways surged.

He was born on a council estate, raised mostly by his mother as he describes his father being in and out of prison and not really being the father figure he desperately needed. When Brian left home he went to work on the oil rigs, scuba diving to work on them underwater. He describes how this would put him into life or death situations on a daily basis. The colleges he gained on the oil rigs became his father figures.   After leaving the oil rigs he started YouTube under the name footballfan533, and first rose to prominence when his first video (titled A True Geordie's view on Nile Ranger) went viral. Brian quickly gained a following due to his expletive and passionate opinions, and therefore changed his channel name to True Geordie, uploading more regularly. He was originally known for uploading rants about his football, but has since become best-known for the eponymous True Geordie Podcast, hosted by himself and his best friend Laurence McKenna. Geordie was chosen the host and commentator for the KSI V Joe Weller fight in February 2018. He had previously been a commentator for some of the charity football matches.\u00a0   I met Brian back in 2017 to record his podcast, we recorded it in a tiny abandoned bomb shelter that he paid \u00a350 a day to rent out. Brian has come a long way since then, running a rapidly growing Youtube channel thats accumulating millions upon millions of views per week, he\u2019s commentated on one of the largest Youtube events in history and he\u2019s also created some of the best content I\u2019ve ever seen. All of this was quickly ripped away from him last year after one of the hardest weeks of his life, something we talk a lot about today. He\u2019s gone through it all, been to the darkest of places, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. However this didn\u2019t stop him getting back on his feet and rebuilding himself from the ground up, coming back bigger and better than before.\u00a0   Topics:  Your early years\u00a0 The rise of True Geordie\u00a0 The fall of True Geordie You Mother Your Dad Your experiences with anxiety\u00a0 Your depression You never relax Attaching your happiness to a future goal What the cost of being ambitious?\u00a0 Whats the big ambition?

He was born on a council estate, raised mostly by his mother as he describes his father being in and out of prison and not really being the father figure he desperately needed. When Brian left home he went to work on the oil rigs, scuba diving to work on them underwater. He describes how this would put him into life or death situations on a daily basis. The colleges he gained on the oil rigs became his father figures.   After leaving the oil rigs he started YouTube under the name footballfan533, and first rose to prominence when his first video (titled A True Geordie's view on Nile Ranger) went viral. Brian quickly gained a following due to his expletive and passionate opinions, and therefore changed his channel name to True Geordie, uploading more regularly. He was originally known for uploading rants about his football, but has since become best-known for the eponymous True Geordie Podcast, hosted by himself and his best friend Laurence McKenna.

And let\u2019s face it, Monzo, one of the companies Tom founded and led, is the one of the most forward-thinking, innovative, fastest-growing companies there is.\u00a0   Tom was born in Hong Kong and lived with his father and mother. His father was a business-minded civil engineer and his mother was an artist. When Tom was a child, he moved to London to attend grammar school in Amersham, Buckinghamshire then moving on to study Law at Oxford. Whilst studying at Oxford, at the age of 21, he co-founded Boso.com an \u201ceBay for students\u201d. After a few internships with law firms he decided being a lawyer wasn't for him and followed the entrepreneurial journey instead.\u00a0   In January 2011 Blomfield co-founded the UK-based company GoCardless, an automated payment method that processes Direct Debit payments on behalf of other businesses and organisations. Blomfield stayed in Silicon Valley during his three years at the company, it raised around \u00a335 million of investment and hired 100 people. When GoCardless appointed Hiroki Takeuchi as CEO in 2013, he left (keeping a \"very small share\" in the \u00a350-100m valued company) Tom moved to New York to work for dating site Grouper social club as their Head of Growth. Blomfield left Grouper in 2014, and it closed in 2016.   Following his departure from Grouper Social Club Blomfield joined Anne Boden\u2019s Starling bank as the CTO. Startling was, at that point one of the first digital banking companies. Tom left the company in early 2015 after reports of disagreements at Starling, telling the Financial Times that \"he could not comment under the terms of his departure\". Today we learn about what really happened at Starling.   In 2015, he founded challenger bank Monzo, operating with no branches and instead offering accounts online In its first fundraising round, the company raised \"\u00a31 million in 96 seconds\u201d. In April, Blomfield announced he would forgo his salary for one year to help his company during the COVID-19 pandemic In May, he announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Monzo and taking on the role of president of the company. In January 2021 he announced he was leaving the company permanently.   This conversation today takes us through Tom\u2019s wild entrepreneurial journey expressing the highs and lows of running a business. He also talks about the disagreements at Starling bank and ultimately his reason for starting Monzo in the first place. His stories are unique, and more importantly honest. Unbelievably honest. He tells you the mistakes he made, his deepest insecurities, his biggest challenges and the things he wish he knew. Wow this is a good one.    Why entrepreneurship? What made you want to disrupt an industry? Monzo & Starling rivalry\u00a0 Starting Monzo Wanting to be seen to be a success What were the good times at Monzo? What were the bad times at Mozo? Was the business model of Monzo bad? Leaving Monzo Not sleeping because of the stress of the business How was holding down a relationship while running the business? The \u201cred phone\u201d in your bedroom What was your life like outside of the business?\u00a0 The road to leaving Monzo The urge to go back Death Threats Enjoying the small things in life and relationships Your purpose in life Crypto currencies The good things about being a CEO      Tom: https://twitter.com/t_blom  https://www.li\nLearn more about your ad choices.

When GoCardless appointed Hiroki Takeuchi as CEO in 2013, he left (keeping a \"very small share\" in the \u00a350-100m valued company) Tom moved to New York to work for dating site Grouper social club as their Head of Growth. Blomfield left Grouper in 2014, and it closed in 2016.   Following his departure from Grouper Social Club Blomfield joined Anne Boden\u2019s Starling bank as the CTO. Startling was, at that point one of the first digital banking companies. Tom left the company in early 2015 after reports of disagreements at Starling, telling the Financial Times that \"he could not comment under the terms of his departure\". Today we learn about what really happened at Starling.   In 2015, he founded challenger bank Monzo, operating with no branches and instead offering accounts online In its first fundraising round, the company raised \"\u00a31 million in 96 seconds\u201d.

In January 2021 he announced he was leaving the company permanently.   This conversation today takes us through Tom\u2019s wild entrepreneurial journey expressing the highs and lows of running a business. He also talks about the disagreements at Starling bank and ultimately his reason for starting Monzo in the first place. His stories are unique, and more importantly honest. Unbelievably honest.

                "summary": "This podcast is a real treat and a podcast that you cannot miss!  Johann has come back and what honour it was to record. He has to be my all-time favourite guest ever! His book \u2018Lost Connections\u2019 had such a positive, transformative impact on my life and truly changed my perspective on how I viewed depression & addiction. I am sure that the information shared today will be valuable and important topics that our society needs to hear.\u00a0  Johann is a very successful and inspirational British-Swiss writer and journalist with 2 books hitting The New York Times best sellers list. Born in Glasgow Scotland then relocated to London when he was young, Johann experienced some childhood trauma having suffered from being physically abused as child and his mother suffering from an illness.  Starting his career as a journalist he won many awards such as Journalist of the year and was named by the Daily Telegraph as one of the most influential people. Johann then went to onto being an author writing the worldwide known \u201cLost Connections\u201d and \u201cChasing the Scream\u201d. He also released a TED talk back in 2015 \u201cEverything you think you know about addiction is wrong\u201d which has now over 17 million views.

As a former Football player, he is one of the most decorated English footballers of all time and regarded by many loyal fans \u2013 one of England\u2019s greatest players. I grew up as a United Fan, watching him, idolising him and now he is my mate.   Growing up on an Estate in Peckham, Rio\u2019s parents encouraged his curiosity. Many of you, may not know, Rio danced ballet to a high standard before choosing to pursue a career in football... and well, you might think you know how the story goes. You don\u2019t. In this open, intimate and honest conversation Rio talks about his achievements, failures, successes and how his life experiences have made him the father he is today.   Rio has broken many football records during his premiership \u2013 He joined Manchester United in July 2002 for record breaking fee of \u00a330 million. He has featured in the PFA Team of the Year four times in 5 years. More club magic spread, as the club followed with another Premier league Win in 2006-07 all under Sir Alex Fergusons lead. During Rio\u2019s time at United, Rio respectfully won 6 Premier League Titles and 14 Trophies. Rio announced his retirements from professional football on 30 May 2015.   After retirement Rio has joined BT Sport as a Pundit. The BBC one documentary - Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad. The documentary won the Robert Flaherty Award for Single Documentary at the 2018 BAFTA Awards.   Rio is a special guy, not least for what he\u2019s achieved but for who he is, and today. You\u2019re going to find out who he actually is. The philosophy to life that he swears by, and the culture required for you to win in an ambitious career, but also the culture required to win in your personal life.

Most recently Ant has been caught up in a media storm after Channel 4 axed him from SAS: Who Dares Wins after five years, the broadcaster said that ant\u2019s 'views and values we not aligned to theirs'. This is his first in-depth conversation he recorded since he was \u201ccancelled\u201d. Ant, Thank you for your honesty.

The book went on to become the UK\u2019s bestselling business hardback of 2019, being translated into 13 languages and long-listed for Business Book of the Year 2020 and CMI Management Book of the Year 2020.   His literary and business successes have culminated in Bruce being named one of the Evening Standard\u2019s 1000 Most Influential Londoners and one of Debrett\u2019s 500 Most Influential People in Britain. At the CBI Annual Conference, he was voted the top-rated speaker, having shared the stage with the Prime Minister and Jeremy Corbyn. Alongside his literary pursuits, Bruce hosts and runs the \u2018Eat Sleep Work Repeat\u2019 podcast on workplace culture which has reached #1 spot on the Apple Business Podcast Chart. He now devotes his time to championing reforms to culture in the workplace. He is also a published writer in the Harvard Business Review, Wall Street Journal & The Guardian.

Anna is Britain\u2019s most successful female marathon kayaker with a staggering eleven World and European Championship medals, 9 of them gold. By the age of 24 she had been a World Champion 3 times and competed at the Olympic Games. In 2010 she was awarded an MBE for her services to sport.  Hemmings achieved this success against all the odds. She was told by the British head coach that she was not big enough or strong enough to be a great kayaker. She proved him wrong. At the peak of her career, Anna was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\u00a0 and was told by medical experts she might never race again. She battled her way to full recovery and went on to win a further 3 world titles and compete at her second Olympic Games in Beijing 2008. She has become an expert in the field of resilience and high performance. Anna is now an Executive coach and founded Beyond the Barriers, a high performance training consultancy which works globally with leaders and teams giving them practical tools and strategies to enable them to thrive under pressure, build resilience, be mentally tough in challenging environments and deliver world class performance.  Anna\u2019s sporting achievements were recognised at the Sunday Times Sports Woman of the Year Awards, where she won the 2005 Champions Award and then again in 2007 when she was voted BBC London Sports Personality of the Year.  This week's podcast gave me more realisations than I\u2019ve ever had from a guest before. We spoke about the multiple challenges she faced throughout her career and how despite all of the hardships, she was able to keep going when all the signs were there to give-up.

But when you dig a little deeper, I found something else, something much more revealing, something that made me unsure whether I should feel sorry for him, or be impressed by him. During our discussion he shared so many pieces of valuable information from his journey climbing to the very top of the business ladder\u2026 and he isn\u2019t finished yet!  Topics: - What made you so relentless\u00a0 - The sacrifices in-order to be successful\u00a0 - Deathbed thinking - Is ambition choice? - Finding the work life balance for a relationship\u00a0 - Your experience with mental health - Social media - I don't like being a celebrity\u00a0 - Selling Matchroom   Sponsor - https://uk.huel.com/ \nLearn more about your ad choices.

At 18 I started a company which would eventually become \"Social Chain\" - an industry leading marketing company. At 26 the company was generating $600m a year in revenue. At 27 I resigned as CEO, and launched 'The Diary Of A CEO' podcast with the simple mission of un-filtering success and giving you the knowledge you need to create the life you want.
